TODO: 
      Rearrange folder content
      Move load.py into corpus/preprocessing
      Make load.py and other preprocessing code more generic (dual window rewrite)
      Adapt load.py to write ALL characters into the above structure
      Extract non-inline stage directions
      Plan different model configurations (scope, word vs char level)
