ACT I.

Lavarcham's house
on Slieve Fuadh.



_Lavarcham's house on Slieve Fuadh.  There
is a door to inner room on the left, and a door
to open air on the right.  Window at back
and a frame with a half-finished piece of
tapestry.  There are also a large press and
heavy oak chest near the back wall.  The place
is neat and clean but bare.  Lavarcham, woman
of fifty, is working at tapestry frame.  Old
Woman comes in from left._


OLD WOMAN.  She hasn't come yet,
is it, and it falling to the night?

LAVARCHAM.  She has not. . . (_Con-
cealing her anxiety._)  It's dark with the
clouds are coming from the west and south,
but it isn't later than the common.

OLD WOMAN.  It's later, surely, and I
hear tell the Sons of Usna, Naisi and his
brothers, are above chasing hares for two days
or three, and the same awhile since when the
moon was full.

LAVARCHAM -- _more anxiously._ -- The
gods send they don't set eyes on her -- (_with_


16


_a sign of helplessness_) yet if they do itself,
it wasn't my wish brought them or could send
them away.

OLD WOMAN -- _reprovingly._ -- If it
wasn't, you'd do well to keep a check on her,
and she turning a woman that was meant to
be a queen.

LAVARCHAM.  Who'd check her like
was meant to have her pleasure only, the way
if there were no warnings told about her you'd
see troubles coming when an old king is taking
her, and she without a thought but for her
beauty and to be straying the hills.

OLD WOMAN.  The gods help the lot of
us. . . .  Shouldn't she be well pleased getting
the like of Conchubor, and he middling settled
in his years itself?  I don't know what he
wanted putting her this wild place to be
breaking her in, or putting myself to be roast-
ing her supper and she with no patience for
her food at all.         [_She looks out._

LAVARCHAM.  Is she coming from the
glen?

OLD WOMAN.  She is not.  But whisht
-- there's two men leaving the furze --
(_crying out_) it's Conchubor and Fergus along
with him.  Conchubor'll be in a blue stew this
night and herself abroad.


17


LAVARCHAM -- _settling room hastily._ --
Are they close by?

OLD WOMAN.  Crossing the stream, and
there's herself on the hillside with a load of
twigs.  Will I run out and put her in order
before they'll set eyes on her at all?

LAVARCHAM.  You will not.  Would
you have him see you, and he a man would
be jealous of a hawk would fly between her
and the rising sun.  (_She looks out._)  Go up
to the hearth and be as busy as if you hadn't
seen them at all.

OLD WOMAN -- _sitting down to polish
vessel._ -- There'll be trouble this night, for he
should be in his tempers from the way he's
stepping out, and he swinging his hands.

LAVARCHAM -- _wearied with the whole
matter._ -- It'd be best of all, maybe, if he got
in tempers with herself, and made an end
quickly, for I'm in a poor way between the
pair of them (_going back to tapestry frame._)
There they are now at the door.
[_Conchubor and Fergus come in._

CONCHUBOR AND FERGUS.  The
gods save you.

LAVARCHAM -- _getting up and courtesy-
ing._ -- The gods save and keep you kindly, and
stand between you and all harm for ever.


18


CONCHUBOR -- _looking around._ -- Where
is Deirdre?

LAVARCHAM -- _trying to speak with in-
difference._ -- Abroad upon Slieve Fuadh.  She
does be all times straying around picking
flowers or nuts, or sticks itself; but so long
as she's gathering new life I've a right not to
heed her, I'm thinking, and she taking her will.
[_Fergus talks to Old Woman._

CONCHUBOR -- _stiffly._ -- A night with
thunder coming is no night to be abroad.

LAVARCHAM -- _more uneasily._ -- She's
used to every track and pathway, and the
lightning itself wouldn't let down its flame to
singe the beauty of her like.

FERGUS -- _cheerfully._ -- She's right, Con-
chubor, and let you sit down and take your
ease, (_he takes a wallet from under his cloak_)
and I'll count out what we've brought, and
put it in the presses within.
[_He goes into the inner room with the
Old Woman._

CONCHUBOR -- _sitting down and look-
ing about._ -- Where are the mats and hangings
and the silver skillets I sent up for Deirdre?

LAVARCHAM.  The mats and hangings
are in this press, Conchubor.  She wouldn't
wish to be soiling them, she said, running out


19

and in with mud and grasses on her feet, and
it raining since the night of Samhain.  The
silver skillets and the golden cups we have
beyond locked in the chest.

CONCHUBOR.  Bring them out and use
them from this day.

LAVARCHAM.  We'll do it, Conchubor.

CONCHUBOR -- _getting up and going to
frame._ -- Is this hers?

LAVARCHAM -- _pleased to speak of it._ --
It is, Conchubor.  All say there isn't her match
at fancying figures and throwing purple upon
crimson, and she edging them all times with
her greens and gold.

CONCHUBOR -- _a little uneasily._ -- Is she
keeping wise and busy since I passed before,
and growing ready for her life in Emain?

LAVARCHAM -- _dryly._ -- That is a ques-
tion will give small pleasure to yourself or me.
(_Making up her mind to speak out._)  If it's
the truth I'll tell you, she's growing too wise
to marry a big king and she a score only.  Let
you not be taking it bad, Conchubor, but you'll
get little good seeing her this night, for with
all my talking it's wilfuller she's growing these
two months or three.

CONCHUBOR -- _severely, but relieved
things are no worse._ -- Isn't it a poor thing


20

you're doing so little to school her to meet
what is to come?

LAVARCHAM.  I'm after serving you
two score of years, and I'll tell you this night,
Conchubor, she's little call to mind an old
woman when she has the birds to school her,
and the pools in the rivers where she goes
bathing in the sun.  I'll tell you if you seen
her that time, with her white skin, and her red
lips, and the blue water and the ferns about
her, you'd know, maybe, and you greedy itself,
it wasn't for your like she was born at all.

CONCHUBOR.  It's little I heed for what
she was born; she'll be my comrade, surely.
[_He examines her workbox._

LAVARCHAM -- _sinking into sadness
again._ -- I'm in dread so they were right say-
ing she'd bring destruction on the world, for
it's a poor thing when you see a settled man
putting the love he has for a young child, and
the love he has for a full woman, on a girl the
like of her; and it's a poor thing, Conchubor,
to see a High King, the way you are this day,
prying after her needles and numbering her
lines of thread.

CONCHUBOR -- _getting up._ -- Let you
not be talking too far and you old itself.


21

(_Walks across room and back._)  Does she
know the troubles are foretold?

LAVARCHAM -- _in the tone of the earlier
talk._ -- I'm after telling her one time and
another, but I'd do as well speaking to a lamb
of ten weeks and it racing the hills. . . .  It's
not the dread of death or troubles that would
tame her like.

CONCHUBOR -- _he looks out._ -- She's
coming now, and let you walk in and keep
Fergus till I speak with her a while.

LAVARCHAM -- _going left._ -- If I'm
after vexing you itself, it'd be best you weren't
taking her hasty or scolding her at all.

CONCHUBOR -- _very stiffly._ -- I've no
call to.  I'm well pleased she's light and airy.

LAVARCHAM -- _offended at his tone._ --
Well pleased is it?  (_With a snort of irony_)
It's a queer thing the way the likes of me do
be telling the truth, and the wise are lying all
times.
[_She goes into room on left.  Conchubor
arranges himself before a mirror for a
moment, then goes a little to the left
and waits.  Deirdre comes in poorly
dressed, with a little bag and a bundle
of twigs in her arms.  She is astonished
for a moment when she sees Conchu-_


22

_bor; then she makes a courtesy to him,
and goes to the hearth without any
embarrassment._

CONCHUBOR.  The gods save you,
Deirdre.  I have come up bringing you rings
and jewels from Emain Macha.

DEIRDRE.  The gods save you.

CONCHUBOR.  What have you brought
from the hills?

DEIRDRE -- _quite self-possessed._ -- A bag
of nuts, and twigs for our fires at the dawn
of day.

CONCHUBOR -- _showing annoyance in
spite of himself._ -- And it's that way you're
picking up the manners will fit you to be Queen
of Ulster?

DEIRDRE -- _made a little defiant by his
tone._ -- I have no wish to be a queen.

CONCHUBOR -- _almost sneeringly._ --
You'd wish to be dressing in your duns and
grey, and you herding your geese or driving
your calves to their shed -- like the common
lot scattered in the glens.

DEIRDRE -- _very defiant._ -- I would not,
Conchubor.  (_She goes to tapestry and begins
to work._)  A girl born the way I'm born is
more likely to wish for a mate who'd be her
likeness. . . .  A man with his hair like the


23

raven, maybe, and his skin like the snow and
his lips like blood spilt on it.

CONCHUBOR -- _sees his mistake, and
after a moment takes a flattering tone, looking
at her work._ -- Whatever you wish, there's no
queen but would be well pleased to have your
skill at choosing colours and making pictures
on the cloth.  (_Looking closely._)  What is it
you're figuring?

DEIRDRE -- _deliberately._ -- Three young
men and they chasing in the green gap of a
wood.

CONCHUBOR -- _now almost pleading._ --
It's soon you'll have dogs with silver chains
to be chasing in the woods of Emain, for I
have white hounds rearing up for you, and
grey horses, that I've chosen from the finest
in Ulster and Britain and Gaul.

DEIRDRE -- _unmoved as before._ -- I've
heard tell, in Ulster and Britain and Gaul,
Naisi and his brothers have no match and they
chasing in the woods.

CONCHUBOR -- _very gravely._ -- Isn't it
a strange thing you'd be talking of Naisi and
his brothers, or figuring them either, when you
know the things that are foretold about them-
selves and you?  Yet you've little knowledge,
and I'd do wrong taking it bad when it'll be


24

my share from this out to keep you the way
you'll have little call to trouble for knowledge,
or its want either.

DEIRDRE.  Yourself should be wise,
surely.

CONCHUBOR.  The like of me has a
store of knowledge that's a weight and terror.
It's for that we do choose out the like of your-
self that are young and glad only. . . .  I'm
thinking you are gay and lively each day in
the year?

DEIRDRE.  I don't know if that's true,
Conchubor.  There are lonesome days and bad
nights in this place like another.

CONCHUBOR.  You should have as few
sad days, I'm thinking, as I have glad and
good ones.

DEIRDRE.  What is it has you that way
ever coming this place, when you'd hear the
old woman saying a good child's as happy as
a king?

CONCHUBOR.  How would I be happy
seeing age coming on me each year, when the
dry leaves are blowing back and forward at
the gate of Emain?  And yet this last while
I'm saying out, when I see the furze breaking
and the daws sitting two and two on ash-trees
by the duns of Emain, Deirdre's a year nearer


25

her full age when she'll be my mate and com-
rade and then I'm glad surely.

DEIRDRE -- _almost to herself._ -- I will
not be your mate in Emain.

CONCHUBOR -- _not heeding her._ -- It's
there you'll be proud and happy and you'll
learn that, if young men are great hunters, yet
it's with the like of myself you'll find a knowl-
edge of what is priceless in your own like.
What we all need is a place is safe and
splendid, and it's that you'll get in Emain in
two days or three.

DEIRDRE -- _aghast._ -- Two days!

CONCHUBOR.  I have the rooms ready,
and in a little while you'll be brought down
there, to be my queen and queen of the five
parts of Ireland.

DEIRDRE -- _standing up frightened and
pleading._ -- I'd liefer stay this place, Con-
chubor. . . .  Leave me this place, where I'm
well used to the tracks and pathways and the
people of the glens. . . .  It's for this life I'm
born, surely.

CONCHUBOR.  You'll be happier and
greater with myself in Emain.  It is I will be
your comrade, and will stand between you and
the great troubles are foretold.

DEIRDRE.  I will not be your queen in


26

Emain when it's my pleasure to be having my
freedom on the edges of the hills.

CONCHUBOR.  It's my wish to have you
quickly; I'm sick and weary thinking of the
day you'll be brought down to me, and seeing
you walking into my big, empty halls.  I've
made all sure to have you, and yet all said
there's a fear in the back of my mind I'd miss
you and have great troubles in the end.  It's
for that, Deirdre, I'm praying that you'll
come quickly; and you may take the word of
a man has no lies, you'll not find, with any
other, the like of what I'm bringing you in
wildness and confusion in my own mind.

DEIRDRE.  I cannot go, Conchubor.

CONCHUBOR -- _taking a triumphant
tone._ -- It is my pleasure to have you, and I
a man is waiting a long while on the throne
of Ulster.  Wouldn't you liefer be my com-
rade, growing up the like of Emer and Maeve,
than to be in this place and you a child always?

DEIRDRE.  You don't know me and
you'd have little joy taking me, Conchubor.
. . .  I'm a long while watching the days
getting a great speed passing me by.  I'm too
long taking my will, and it's that way I'll be
living always.

CONCHUBOR -- _dryly._ -- Call Fergus to


27

come with me.  This is your last night upon
Slieve Fuadh.

DEIRDRE -- _now pleadingly._ -- Leave me
a short space longer, Conchubor.  Isn't it a
poor thing I should be hastened away, when
all these troubles are foretold?  Leave me a
year, Conchubor; it isn't much I'm asking.

CONCHUBOR.  It's much to have me
two score and two weeks waiting for your
voice in Emain, and you in this place growing
lonesome and shy.  I'm a ripe man and in
great love, and yet, Deirdre, I'm the King of
Ulster.  (_He gets up._)  I'll call Fergus, and
we'll make Emain ready in the morning.
[_He goes towards door on left._

DEIRDRE -- _clinging to him._ -- Do not
call him, Conchubor. . . .  Promise me a year
of quiet. . . .  It's one year I'm asking only.

CONCHUBOR.  You'd be asking a year
next year, and the years that follow.  (_Call-
ing._)  Fergus!  Fergus!  (_To Deirdre._)
Young girls are slow always; it is their lovers
that must say the word.  (_Calling._)  Fergus!
[_Deirdre springs away from him as
Fergus comes in with Lavarcham and
the Old Woman._

CONCHUBOR -- _to Fergus._ -- There is a


28

storm coming, and we'd best be going to our
people when the night is young.

FERGUS -- _cheerfully._ -- The gods shield
you, Deirdre.  (_To Conchubor._)  We're late
already, and it's no work the High King to
be slipping on stepping-stones and hilly path-
ways when the floods are rising with the rain.
[_He helps Conchubor into his cloak._

CONCHUBOR -- _glad that he has made
his decision -- to Lavarcham._ -- Keep your
rules a few days longer, and you'll be brought
down to Emain, you and Deirdre with you.

LAVARCHAM -- _obediently._ -- Your rules
are kept always.

CONCHUBOR.  The gods shield you.
[_He goes out with Fergus.  Old Woman
bolts door._

LAVARCHAM -- _looking at Deirdre, who
has covered her face._ -- Wasn't I saying you'd
do it?  You've brought your marriage a sight
nearer not heeding those are wiser than your-
self.

DEIRDRE -- _with agitation._ -- It wasn't I
did it.  Will you take me from this place,
Lavarcham, and keep me safe in the hills?

LAVARCHAM.  He'd have us tracked in
the half of a day, and then you'd be his queen


29

in spite of you, and I and mine would be
destroyed for ever.

DEIRDRE -- _terrified with the reality that
is before her._ -- Are there none can go against
Conchubor?

LAVARCHAM.  Maeve of Connaught
only, and those that are her like.

DEIRDRE.  Would Fergus go against
him?

LAVARCHAM.  He would, maybe, and
his temper roused.

DEIRDRE -- _in a lower voice with sudden
excitement._ -- Would Naisi and his brothers?

LAVARCHAM -- _impatiently._ -- Let you
not be dwelling on Naisi and his brothers. . . .
In the end of all there is none can go against
Conchubor, and it's folly that we're talking,
for if any went against Conchubor it's sorrow
he'd earn and the shortening of his day of life.
[_She turns away, and Deirdre stands up
stiff with excitement and goes and
looks out of the window._

DEIRDRE.  Are the stepping-stones flood-
ing, Lavarcham?  Will the night be stormy in
the hills?

LAVARCHAM -- _looking at her curiously._
The stepping-stones are flooding, surely, and


30

the night will be the worst, I'm thinking, we've
seen these years gone by.

DEIRDRE -- _tearing open the press and
pulling out clothes and tapestries._ -- Lay these
mats and hangings by the windows, and at the
tables for our feet, and take out the skillets
of silver, and the golden cups we have, and
our two flasks of wine.

LAVARCHAM.  What ails you?

DEIRDRE -- _gathering up a dress._ -- Lay
them out quickly, Lavarcham, we've no call
dawdling this night.  Lay them out quickly;
I'm going into the room to put on the rich
dresses and jewels have been sent from Emain.

LAVARCHAM.  Putting on dresses at
this hour, and it dark and drenching with the
weight of rain!  Are you away in your head?

DEIRDRE -- _gathering her things to-
gether with an outburst of excitement._ -- I will
dress like Emer in Dundealgan, or Maeve in
her house in Connaught.  If Conchubor'll
make me a queen, I'll have the right of a queen
who is a master, taking her own choice and
making a stir to the edges of the seas. . . .
Lay out your mats and hangings where I can
stand this night and look about me.  Lay out
the skins of the rams of Connaught and of the
goats of the west.  I will not be a child or


31

plaything; I'll put on my robes that are the
richest, for I will not be brought down to
Emain as Cuchulain brings his horse to the
yoke, or Conall Cearneach puts his shield
upon his arm; and maybe from this day I will
turn the men of Ireland like a wind blowing
on the heath.
[_She goes into room.  Lavarcham and
Old Woman look at each other, then
the Old Woman goes over, looks in at
Deirdre through chink of the door, and
then closes it carefully._

OLD WOMAN -- _in a frightened whisper._
-- She's thrown off the rags she had about
her, and there she is in her skin; she's putting
her hair in shiny twists.  Is she raving,
Lavarcham, or has she a good right turning
to a queen like Maeve?

LAVARCHAM -- _putting up hanging very
anxiously._ -- It's more than raving's in her
mind, or I'm the more astray; and yet she's
as good a right as another, maybe, having her
pleasure, though she'd spoil the world.

OLD WOMAN -- _helping her._ -- Be quick
before she'll come back. . . .  Who'd have
thought we'd run before her, and she so quiet
till to-night.  Will the High King get the


32

better of her, Lavarcham?  If I was Con-
chubor, I wouldn't marry with her like at all.

LAVARCHAM.  Hang that by the win-
dow.  That should please her, surely.  When
all's said, it's her like will be the master till
the end of time.

OLD WOMAN -- _at the window._ -- There's
a mountain of blackness in the sky, and the
greatest rain falling has been these long years
on the earth.  The gods help Conchubor.  He'll
be a sorry man this night, reaching his dun,
and he with all his spirits, thinking to himself
he'll be putting his arms around her in two
days or three.

LAVARCHAM.  It's more than Conchu-
bor'll be sick and sorry, I'm thinking, before
this story is told to the end.
[_Loud knocking on door at the right._

LAVARCHAM -- _startled._ -- Who is that?

NAISI -- _outside._ -- Naisi and his brothers.

LAVARCHAM.  We are lonely women.
What is it you're wanting in the blackness of
the night?

NAISI.  We met a young girl in the woods
who told us we might shelter this place if the
rivers rose on the pathways and the floods
gathered from the butt of the hills.
[_Old Woman clasps her hands in horror._


33


LAVARCHAM -- _with great alarm._ -- You
cannot come in. . . .  There is no one let in
here, and no young girl with us.

NAISI.  Let us in from the great storm.
Let us in and we will go further when the
cloud will rise.

LAVARCHAM.  Go round east to the
shed and you'll have shelter.  You cannot
come in.

NAISI -- _knocking loudly._ -- Open the
door or we will burst it.  (_The door is shaken._)

OLD WOMAN -- _in a timid whisper._ --
Let them in, and keep Deirdre in her room
to-night.

AINNLE AND ARDAN -- _outside._ --
Open!  Open!

LAVARCHAM -- _to Old Woman._ -- Go
in and keep her.

OLD WOMAN.  I couldn't keep her.  I've
no hold on her.  Go in yourself and I will
free the door.

LAVARCHAM.  I must stay and turn
them out.  (_She pulls her hair and cloak over
her face._)  Go in and keep her.

OLD WOMAN.  The gods help us.
[_She runs into the inner room._

VOICES.  Open!

LAVARCHAM -- _opening the door._ --


34

Come in then and ill-luck if you'll have it so.
[_Naisi and Ainnle and Ardan come in
and look round with astonishment._

NAISI.  It's a rich man has this place, and
no herd at all.

LAVARCHAM -- _sitting down with her
head half covered._ -- It is not, and you'd best
be going quickly.

NAISI -- _hilariously, shaking rain from
his clothes._ -- When we've had the pick of luck
finding princely comfort in the darkness of
the night!  Some rich man of Ulster should
come here and he chasing in the woods.  May
we drink?  (_He takes up flask._)  Whose
wine is this that we may drink his health?

LAVARCHAM.  It's no one's that you've
call to know.

NAISI.  Your own health then and length
of life.  (_Pouring out wine for the three.
They drink._)

LAVARCHAM -- _very crossly._ -- You're
great boys taking a welcome where it isn't
given, and asking questions where you've no
call to. . . .  If you'd a quiet place settled
up to be playing yourself, maybe, with a gentle
queen, what'd you think of young men prying
around and carrying tales?  When I was a bit
of a girl the big men of Ulster had better


35

manners, and they the like of your three selves,
in the top folly of youth.  That'll be a story
to tell out in Tara that Naisi is a tippler and
stealer, and Ainnle the drawer of a stranger's
cork.

NAISI -- _quite cheerfully, sitting down be-
side her._ -- At your age you should know
there are nights when a king like Conchubor
will spit upon his arm ring, and queens will
stick their tongues out at the rising moon.
We're that way this night, and it's not wine
we're asking only.  Where is the young girl
told us we might shelter here?

LAVARCHAM.  Asking me you'd be?
We're decent people, and I wouldn't put you
tracking a young girl, not if you gave me the
gold clasp you have hanging on your coat.

NAISI -- _giving it to her._ -- Where is she?

LAVARCHAM -- _in confidential whisper,
putting her hand on his arm._ -- Let you walk
back into the hills and turn up by the second
cnuceen where there are three together.  You'll
see a path running on the rocks and then you'll
hear the dogs barking in the houses, and their
noise will guide you till you come to a bit of
cabin at the foot of an ash-tree.  It's there
there is a young and flighty girl that I'm
thinking is the one you've seen.


36


NAISI -- _hilariously._ -- Here's health, then,
to herself and you!

ARDAN.  Here's to the years when you
were young as she!

AINNLE -- _in a frightened whisper._ --
Naisi!
[_Naisi looks up and Ainnle beckons to
him.  He goes over and Ainnle points
to something on the golden mug he
holds in his hand._

NAISI -- looking at it in astonishment._ --
This is the High King's. . . .  I see his mark
on the rim.  Does Conchubor come lodging
here?

LAVARCHAM -- _jumping up with ex-
treme annoyance._ -- Who says it's Conchu-
bor's?  How dare young fools the like of you
-- (_speaking with vehement insolence_) come
prying around, running the world into troubles
for some slip of a girl?  What brings you this
place straying from Emain?  (_Very bitterly._)
Though you think, maybe, young men can do
their fill of foolery and there is none to blame
them.

NAISI -- _very soberly._ -- Is the rain easing?

ARDAN.  The clouds are breaking. . . .
I can see Orion in the gap of the glen.

NAISI -- _still cheerfully._ -- Open the door


37

and we'll go forward to the little cabin between
the ash-tree and the rocks.  Lift the bolt and
pull it.
[_Deirdre comes in on left royally dressed
and very beautiful.  She stands for a
moment, and then as the door opens
she calls softly._

DEIRDRE.  Naisi!  Do not leave me,
Naisi.  I am Deirdre of the Sorrows.

NAISI -- _transfixed with amazement._ --
And it is you who go around in the woods
making the thrushes bear a grudge against the
heavens for the sweetness of your voice
singing.

DEIRDRE.  It is with me you've spoken,
surely.  (_To Lavarcham and Old Woman._)
Take Ainnle and Ardan, these two princes,
into the little hut where we eat, and serve them
with what is best and sweetest.  I have many
thing for Naisi only.

LAVARCHAM -- _overawed by her tone._ --
I will do it, and I ask their pardon.  I have
fooled them here.

DEIRDRE -- _to Ainnle and Ardan._ -- Do
not take it badly that I am asking you to walk
into our hut for a little.  You will have a
supper that is cooked by the cook of Conchu-


38

bor, and Lavarcham will tell you stories of
Maeve and Nessa and Rogh.

AINNLE.  We'll ask Lavarcham to tell us
stories of yourself, and with that we'll be well
pleased to be doing your wish.
[_They all go out except Deirdre and Naisi._

DEIRDRE -- _sitting in the high chair in
the centre._ -- Come to this stool, Naisi (_point-
ing to the stool_).  If it's low itself the High
King would sooner be on it this night than on
the throne of Emain Macha.

NAISI -- _sitting down._ -- You are Fed-
limid's daughter that Conchubor has walled up
from all the men of Ulster.

DEIRDRE.  Do many know what is fore-
told, that Deirdre will be the ruin of the Sons
of Usna, and have a little grave by herself,
and a story will be told for ever?

NAISI.  It's a long while men have been
talking of Deirdre, the child who had all gifts,
and the beauty that has no equal; there are
many know it, and there are kings would give
a great price to be in my place this night and
you grown to a queen.

DEIRDRE.  It isn't many I'd call, Naisi.
. . .  I was in the woods at the full moon
and I heard a voice singing.  Then I gathered
up my skirts, and I ran on a little path I have


39

to the verge of a rock, and I saw you pass by
underneath, in your crimson cloak, singing a
song, and you standing out beyond your
brothers are called the Plower of Ireland.

NAISI.  It's for that you called us in the
dusk?

DEIRDRE -- _in a low voice._ -- Since that,
Naisi, I have been one time the like of a ewe
looking for a lamb that had been taken away
from her, and one time seeing new gold on
the stars, and a new face on the moon, and all
times dreading Emain.

NAISI -- _pulling himself together and be-
ginning to draw back a little._ -- Yet it should
be a lonesome thing to be in this place and you
born for great company.

DEIRDRE -- _softly._ -- This night I have
the best company in the whole world.

NAISI -- _still a little formally._ -- It is I
who have the best company, for when you're
queen in Emain you will have none to be your
match or fellow.

DEIRDRE.  I will not be queen in Emain.

NAISI.  Conchubor has made an oath you
will, surely.

DEIRDRE.  It's for that maybe I'm called
Deirdre, the girl of many sorrows . . . for
it's a sweet life you and I could have, Naisi.


40

. . . .  It should be a sweet thing to have
what is best and richest, if it's for a short
space only.

NAISI -- _very distressed._ -- And we've a
short space only to be triumphant and brave.

DEIRDRE.  You must not go, Naisi, and
leave me to the High King, a man is aging
in his dun, with his crowds round him, and
his silver and gold.  (_More quickly._)  I will
not live to be shut up in Emain, and wouldn't
we do well paying, Naisi, with silence and a
near death.  (_She stands up and walks away
from him._)  I'm a long while in the woods
with my own self, and I'm in little dread of
death, and it earned with riches would make
the sun red with envy, and he going up the
heavens; and the moon pale and lonesome, and
she wasting away.  (_She comes to him and
puts her hands on his shoulders._)  Isn't it a
small thing is foretold about the ruin of our-
selves, Naisi, when all men have age coming
and great ruin in the end?

NAISI.  Yet it's a poor thing it's I should
bring you to a tale of blood and broken bodies,
and the filth of the grave. . . .  Wouldn't we
do well to wait, Deirdre, and I each twilight
meeting you on the sides of the hills?


41


DEIRDRE -- _despondently._ -- His mes-
sengers are coming.

NAISI.  Messengers are coming?

DEIRDRE.  To-morrow morning or the
next, surely.

NAISI.  Then we'll go away.  It isn't I
will give your like to Conchubor, not if the
grave was dug to be my lodging when a week
was by.  (_He looks out._)  The stars are out,
Deirdre, and let you come with me quickly,
for it is the stars will be our lamps many nights
and we abroad in Alban, and taking our
journeys among the little islands in the sea.
There has never been the like of the joy we'll
have, Deirdre, you and I, having our fill of
love at the evening and the morning till the
sun is high.

DEIRDRE.  And yet I'm in dread leaving
this place, where I have lived always.  Won't
I be lonesome and I thinking on the little hill
beyond, and the apple-trees do be budding in
the spring-time by the post of the door?  (_A
little shaken by what has passed._)  Won't I
be in great dread to bring you to destruction,
Naisi, and you so happy and young?

NAISI.  Are you thinking I'd go on living
after this night, Deirdre, and you with Con-
chubor in Emain?  Are you thinking I'd go


42

out after hares when I've had your lips in my
sight?
[_Lavarcham comes in as they cling to
each other._

LAVARCHAM.  Are you raving,
Deirdre?  Are you choosing this night to
destroy the world?

DEIRDRE -- _very deliberately._ -- It's Con-
chubor has chosen this night calling me to
Emain.  (_To Naisi._)  Bring in Ainnle and
Ardan, and take me from this place, where
I'm in dread from this out of the footsteps of
a hare passing.               [_He goes._

DEIRDRE -- _clinging to Lavarcham._ --
Do not take it bad I'm going, Lavarcham.  It's
you have been a good friend and given me
great freedom and joy, and I living on Slieve
Fuadh; and maybe you'll be well pleased one
day saying you have nursed Deirdre.

LAVARCHAM -- _moved._ -- It isn't I'll be
well pleased and I far away from you.  Isn't
it a hard thing you're doing, but who can help
it?  Birds go mating in the spring of the year,
and ewes at the leaves falling, but a young
girl must have her lover in all the courses of
the sun and moon.

DEIRDRE.  Will you go to Emain in the
morning?


43


LAVARCHAM.  I will not.  I'll go to
Brandon in the south; and in the course of a
piece, maybe, I'll be sailing back and forward
on the seas to be looking on your face and the
little ways you have that none can equal.

[_Naisi comes back with Ainnle and Ardan
and Old Woman._


DEIRDRE -- _taking Naisi's hand._ -- My
two brothers, I am going with Naisi to Alban
and the north to face the troubles are foretold.
Will you take word to Conchubor in Emain?

AINNLE.  We will go with you.

ARDAN.  We will be your servants and
your huntsmen, Deirdre.

DEIRDRE.  It isn't one brother only of
you three is brave and courteous.  Will you
wed us, Lavarcham?  You have the words and
customs.

LAVARCHAM.  I will not, then.  What
would I want meddling in the ruin you will
earn?

NAISI.  Let Ainnle wed us. . . .  He has
been with wise men and he knows their ways.

AINNLE -- _joining their hands._ -- By the
sun and moon and the whole earth, I wed
Deirdre to Naisi.  (_He steps back and holds_


44

_up his hands._)  May the air bless you, and
water and the wind, the sea, and all the hours
of the sun and moon.


CURTAIN





ACT II.

_Alban.  Early morning in the
beginning of winter.  Outside
the tent of Deirdre and Naisi.


[page intentionally blank]


_Alban.  Early morning in the beginning of
winter.  A wood outside the tent of Deirdre
and Naisi.  Lavarcham comes in muffled in a
cloak._

LAVARCHAM -- _calling._ -- Deirdre. . . .
Deirdre. . . .

DEIRDRE -- _coming from tent._ -- My
welcome, Lavarcham. . . .  Whose curagh is
rowing from Ulster?  I saw the oars through
the tops of the trees, and I thought it was you
were coming towards us.

LAVARCHAM.  I came in the shower
was before dawn.

DEIRDRE.  And who is coming?

LAVARCHAM -- _mournfully._ -- Let you
not be startled or taking it bad, Deirdre.  It's
Fergus bringing messages of peace from
Conchubor to take Naisi and his brothers
back to Emain.           [_Sitting down._

DEIRDRE -- _lightly._ -- Naisi and his
brothers are well pleased with this place; and
what would take them back to Conchubor in
Ulster?

LAVARCHAM.  Their like would go any


46

place where they'd see death standing.  (_With
more agitation._)  I'm in dread Conchubor
wants to have yourself and to kill Naisi, and
that that'll be the ruin of the Sons of Usna.
I'm silly, maybe, to be dreading the like, but
those have a great love for yourself have a
right to be in dread always.

DEIRDRE -- _more anxiously._ -- Emain
should be no safe place for myself and Naisi.
And isn't it a hard thing they'll leave us no
peace, Lavarcham, and we so quiet in the
woods?

LAVARCHAM -- _impressively._ -- It's a
hard thing, surely; but let you take my word
and swear Naisi, by the earth, and the sun
over it, and the four quarters of the moon, he'll
not go back to Emain -- for good faith or bad
faith -- the time Conchubor's keeping the high
throne of Ireland. . . .  It's that would save
you, surely.

DEIRDRE -- _without hope._ -- There's lit-
tle power in oaths to stop what's coming, and
little power in what I'd do, Lavarcham, to
change the story of Conchubor and Naisi and
the things old men foretold.

LAVARCHAM -- _aggressively._ -- Was
there little power in what you did the night
you dressed in your finery and ran Naisi off


47

along with you, in spite of Conchubor and the
big nobles did dread the blackness of your
luck?  It was power enough you had that
night to bring distress and anguish; and now
I'm pointing you a way to save Naisi, you'll
not stir stick or straw to aid me.

DEIRDRE -- _a little haughtily._ -- Let you
not raise your voice against me, Lavarcham,
if you have will itself to guard Naisi.

LAVARCHAM -- _breaking out in anger._
-- Naisi is it?  I didn't care if the crows were
stripping his thigh-bones at the dawn of day.
It's to stop your own despair and wailing, and
you waking up in a cold bed, without the man
you have your heart on, I am raging now.
(_Starting up with temper._)  Yet there is more
men than Naisi in it; and maybe I was a big
fool thinking his dangers, and this day, would
fill you up with dread.

DEIRDRE -- _sharply._ -- Let you end; such
talking is a fool's only, when it's well you know
if a thing harmed Naisi it isn't I would live
after him.  (_With distress._)  It's well you
know it's this day I'm dreading seven years,
and I fine nights watching the heifers walking
to the haggard with long shadows on the
grass; (_with emotion_) or the time I've been
stretched in the sunshine, when I've heard


48

Ainnle and Ardan stepping lightly, and they
saying: Was there ever the like of Deirdre for
a happy and sleepy queen?

LAVARCHAM -- _not fully pacified._ --
And yet you'll go, and welcome is it, if Naisi
chooses?

DEIRDRE.  I've dread going or staying,
Lavarcham.  It's lonesome this place, having
happiness like ours, till I'm asking each day
will this day match yesterday, and will to-
morrow take a good place beside the same day
in the year that's gone, and wondering all
times is it a game worth playing, living on
until you're dried and old, and our joy is gone
for ever.

LAVARCHAM.  If it's that ails you, I
tell you there's little hurt getting old, though
young girls and poets do be storming at the
shapes of age.  (_Passionately._)  There's little
hurt getting old, saving when you're looking
back, the way I'm looking this day, and seeing
the young you have a love for breaking up
their hearts with folly.  (_Going to Deirdre._)
Take my word and stop Naisi, and the day'll
come you'll have more joy having the senses
of an old woman and you with your little
grandsons shrieking round you, than I'd have
this night putting on the red mouth and the


49

white arms you have, to go walking lonesome
byways with a gamey king.

DEIRDRE.  It's little joy of a young
woman, or an old woman, I'll have from this
day, surely.  But what use is in our talking
when there's Naisi on the foreshore, and
Fergus with him?

LAVARCHAM -- _despairingly._ -- I'm late
so with my warnings, for Fergus'd talk the
moon over to take a new path in the sky.
(_With reproach._)  You'll not stop him this
day, and isn't it a strange story you were a
plague and torment, since you were that
height, to those did hang their lifetimes on
your voice.  (_Overcome with trouble; gather-
ing her cloak about her._)  Don't think bad of
my crying.  I'm not the like of many and I'd
see a score of naked corpses and not heed
them at all, but I'm destroyed seeing yourself
in your hour of joy when the end is coming
surely.
[_Owen comes in quickly, rather ragged,
bows to Deirdre._

OWEN -- _to Lavarcham._ -- Fergus's men
are calling you.  You were seen on the path,
and he and Naisi want you for their talk below.

LAVARCHAM -- _looking at him with dis-
like._ -- Yourself's an ill-lucky thing to meet a


50

morning is the like of this.  Yet if you are a
spy itself I'll go and give my word that's
wanting surely.               [_Goes out._

OWEN -- _to Deirdre._ -- So I've found you
alone, and I after waiting three weeks getting
ague and asthma in the chill of the bogs, till
I saw Naisi caught with Fergus.

DEIRDRE.  I've heard news of Fergus;
what brought you from Ulster?

OWEN -- _who has been searching, finds
a loaf and sits down eating greedily, and cut-
ting it with a large knife._ -- The full moon,
I'm thinking, and it squeezing the crack in my
skull.  Was there ever a man crossed nine
waves after a fool's wife and he not away in
his head?

DEIRDRE -- _absently._ -- It should be a
long time since you left Emain, where there's
civility in speech with queens.

OWEN.  It's a long while, surely.  It's
three weeks I am losing my manners beside
the Saxon bull-frogs at the head of the bog.
Three weeks is a long space, and yet you're
seven years spancelled with Naisi and the pair.

DEIRDRE -- _beginning to fold up her silks
and jewels._ -- Three weeks of your days might
be long, surely, yet seven years are a short
space for the like of Naisi and myself.


51


OWEN -- _derisively._ -- If they're a short
space there aren't many the like of you.
Wasn't there a queen in Tara had to walk out
every morning till she'd meet a stranger and
see the flame of courtship leaping up within
his eye?  Tell me now, (_leaning towards her_)
are you well pleased that length with the same
man snorting next you at the dawn of day?

DEIRDRE -- _very quietly._ -- Am I well
pleased seven years seeing the same sun throw-
ing light across the branches at the dawn of
day?  It's a heartbreak to the wise that it's for
a short space we have the same things only.
(_With contempt._)  Yet the earth itself is a
silly place, maybe, when a man's a fool and
talker.

OWEN -- _sharply._ -- Well, go, take your
choice.  Stay here and rot with Naisi or go to
Conchubor in Emain.  Conchubor's a wrinkled
fool with a swelling belly on him, and eyes
falling downward from his shining crown;
Naisi should be stale and weary.  Yet there
are many roads, Deirdre, and I tell you I'd
liefer be bleaching in a bog-hole than living
on without a touch of kindness from your eyes
and voice.  It's a poor thing to be so lonesome
you'd squeeze kisses on a cur dog's nose.

DEIRDRE.  Are there no women like


52

yourself could be your friends in Emain?

OWEN -- _vehemently._ -- There are none
like you, Deirdre.  It's for that I'm asking are
you going back this night with Fergus?

DEIRDRE.  I will go where Naisi chooses.

OWEN -- _with a burst of rage._ -- It's
Naisi, Naisi, is it?  Then, I tell you, you'll
have great sport one day seeing Naisi getting
a harshness in his two sheep's eyes and he
looking on yourself.  Would you credit it, my
father used to be in the broom and heather
kissing Lavarcham, with a little bird chirping
out above their heads, and now she'd scare a
raven from a carcase on a hill.  (_With a sad
cry that brings dignity into his voice._)  Queens
get old, Deirdre, with their white and long
arms going from them, and their backs hoop-
ing.  I tell you it's a poor thing to see a queen's
nose reaching down to scrape her chin.

DEIRDRE -- _looking out, a little uneasy._
-- Naisi and Fergus are coming on the path.

OWEN.  I'll go so, for if I had you seven
years I'd be jealous of the midges and the dust
is in the air.  (_Muffles himself in his cloak;
with a sort of warning in his voice._)  I'll give
you a riddle, Deirdre: Why isn't my father as
ugly and old as Conchubor?  You've no
answer? . . . .  It's because Naisi killed him.


53

(_With curious expression._)  Think of that
and you awake at night, hearing Naisi snor-
ing, or the night you hear strange stories of
the things I'm doing in Alban or in Ulster
either.
[_He goes out, and in a moment Naisi and
Fergus come in on the other side._

NAISI -- _gaily._ -- Fergus has brought mes-
sages of peace from Conchubor.

DEIRDRE -- _greeting Fergus._ -- He is
welcome.  Let you rest, Fergus, you should be
hot and thirsty after mounting the rocks.

FERGUS.  It's a sunny nook you've found
in Alban; yet any man would be well pleased
mounting higher rocks to fetch yourself and
Naisi back to Emain.

DEIRDRE -- _with keenness._ -- They've
answered?  They would go?

FERGUS -- _benignly._ -- They have not,
but when I was a young man we'd have given
a lifetime to be in Ireland a score of weeks;
and to this day the old men have nothing so
heavy as knowing it's in a short while they'll
lose the high skies are over Ireland, and the
lonesome mornings with birds crying on the
bogs.  Let you come this day, for there's no
place but Ireland where the Gael can have
peace always.


54


NAISI -- _gruffly._ -- It's true, surely.  Yet
we're better this place while Conchubor's in
Emain Macha.

FERGUS -- _giving him parchments._ --
There are your sureties and Conchubor's seal.
(_To Deirdre._)  I am your surety with Con-
chubor.  You'll not be young always, and it's
time you were making yourselves ready for
the years will come, building up a homely dun
beside the seas of Ireland, and getting in your
children from the princes' wives.  It's little
joy wandering till age is on you and your
youth is gone away, so you'd best come this
night, for you'd have great pleasure putting
out your foot and saying, "I am in Ireland,
surely."

DEIRDRE.  It isn't pleasure I'd have
while Conchubor is king in Emain.

FERGUS -- _almost annoyed._ -- Would you
doubt the seals of Conall Cearneach and the
kings of Meath?  (_He gets parchments from
his cloak and gives them to Naisi.  More
gently._)  It's easy being fearful and you alone
in the woods, yet it would be a poor thing if
a timid woman (_taunting her a little_) could
turn away the Sons of Usna from the life of
kings.  Let you be thinking on the years to
come, Deirdre, and the way you'd have a right


55

to see Naisi a high and white-haired justice
beside some king of Emain.  Wouldn't it be a
poor story if a queen the like of you should
have no thought but to be scraping up her
hours dallying in the sunshine with the sons of
kings?

DEIRDRE -- _turning away a little haught-
ily._ -- I leave the choice to Naisi.  (_Turning
back towards Fergus._)  Yet you'd do well,
Fergus, to go on your own way, for the sake
of your own years, so you'll not be saying till
your hour of death, maybe, it was yourself
brought Naisi and his brothers to a grave was
scooped by treachery.         [_Goes into tent._

FERGUS.  It is a poor thing to see a
queen so lonesome and afraid.  (_He watches
till he is sure Deirdre cannot hear him._)
Listen now to what I'm saying.  You'd do well
to come back to men and women are your
match and comrades, and not be lingering
until the day that you'll grow weary, and hurt
Deirdre showing her the hardness will grow
up within your eyes. . . .  You're here years
and plenty to know it's truth I'm saying.
[_Deirdre comes out of tent with a horn
of wine, she catches the beginning of
Naisi's speech and stops with stony
wonder._


56


NAISI -- _very thoughtfully._ -- I'll not tell
you a lie.  There have been days a while past
when I've been throwing a line for salmon or
watching for the run of hares, that I've a dread
upon me a day'd come I'd weary of her voice,
(_very slowly_) and Deirdre'd see I'd wearied.

FERGUS -- _sympathetic but triumphant._ --
I knew it, Naisi. . . .  And take my word,
Deirdre's seen your dread and she'll have no
peace from this out in the woods.

NAISI -- _with confidence._ -- She's not seen
it. . . .  Deirdre's no thought of getting old
or wearied; it's that puts wonder in her days,
and she with spirits would keep bravery and
laughter in a town with plague.
[_Deirdre drops the horn of wine and
crouches down where she is._

FERGUS.  That humour'll leave her.  But
we've no call going too far, with one word
borrowing another.  Will you come this night
to Emain Macha?

NAISI.  I'll not go, Fergus.  I've had
dreams of getting old and weary, and losing
my delight in Deirdre; but my dreams were
dreams only.  What are Conchubor's seals
and all your talk of Emain and the fools of
Meath beside one evening in Glen Masain?
We'll stay this place till our lives and time are


57

worn out.  It's that word you may take in
your curagh to Conchubor in Emain.

FERGUS -- _gathering up his parchments._
-- And you won't go, surely.

NAISI.  I will not. . . .  I've had dread,
I tell you, dread winter and summer, and the
autumn and the springtime, even when there's
a bird in every bush making his own stir till
the fall of night; but this talk's brought me
ease, and I see we're as happy as the leaves on
the young trees, and we'll be so ever and
always, though we'd live the age of the eagle
and the salmon and the crow of Britain.

FERGUS -- _with anger._ -- Where are your
brothers?  My message is for them also.

NAISI.  You'll see them above chasing
otters by the stream.

FERGUS -- _bitterly._ -- It isn't much I was
mistaken, thinking you were hunters only.
[_He goes, Naisi turns towards tent
and sees Deirdre crouching down with
her cloak round her face.  Deirdre
comes out._

NAISI.  You've heard my words to
Fergus?  (_She does not answer.  A pause.  He
puts his arm round her._)  Leave troubling,
and we'll go this night to Glen da Ruadh,


58

where the salmon will be running with the
tide.             [_Crosses and sits down._

DEIRDRE -- _in a very low voice._ -- With
the tide in a little while we will be journeying
again, or it is our own blood maybe will be
running away.  (_She turns and clings to him._)
The dawn and evening are a little while, the
winter and the summer pass quickly, and what
way would you and I, Naisi, have joy for
ever?

NAISI.  We'll have the joy is highest till
our age is come, for it isn't Fergus's talk of
great deeds could take us back to Emain.

DEIRDRE.  It isn't to great deeds you're
going but to near troubles, and the shortening
of your days the time that they are bright and
sunny; and isn't it a poor thing that I, Deirdre,
could not hold you away?

NAISI.  I've said we'd stay in Alban
always.

DEIRDRE.  There's no place to stay al-
ways. . . .  It's a long time we've had,
pressing the lips together, going up and down,
resting in our arms, Naisi, waking with the
smell of June in the tops of the grasses, and
listening to the birds in the branches that are
highest. . . .  It's a long time we've had, but
the end has come, surely.


59


NAISI.  Would you have us go to Emain,
though if any ask the reason we do not know
it, and we journeying as the thrushes come
from the north, or young birds fly out on a
dark sea?

DEIRDRE.  There's reason all times for
an end that's come.  And I'm well pleased,
Naisi, we're going forward in the winter the
time the sun has a low place, and the moon
has her mastery in a dark sky, for it's you
and I are well lodged our last day, where there
is a light behind the clear trees, and the
berries on the thorns are a red wall.

NAISI.  If our time in this place is ended,
come away without Ainnle and Ardan to the
woods of the east, for it's right to be away
from all people when two lovers have their
love only.  Come away and we'll be safe
always.

DEIRDRE -- _broken-hearted._ -- There's no
safe place, Naisi, on the ridge of the world.
. . . .  And it's in the quiet woods I've seen
them digging our grave, throwing out the clay
on leaves are bright and withered.

NAISI -- _still more eagerly._ -- Come away,
Deirdre, and it's little we'll think of safety or
the grave beyond it, and we resting in a little
corner between the daytime and the long night.


60


DEIRDRE -- _clearly and gravely._ -- It's
this hour we're between the daytime and a
night where there is sleep for ever, and isn't
it a better thing to be following on to a near
death, than to be bending the head down, and
dragging with the feet, and seeing one day
a blight showing upon love where it is sweet
and tender.

NAISI -- _his voice broken with distraction._
-- If a near death is coming what will be my
trouble losing the earth and the stars over it,
and you, Deirdre, are their flame and bright
crown?  Come away into the safety of the
woods.

DEIRDRE -- _shaking her head slowly._ --
There are as many ways to wither love as there
are stars in a night of Samhain; but there is
no way to keep life, or love with it, a short
space only. . . .  It's for that there's nothing
lonesome like a love is watching out the time
most lovers do be sleeping. . . .  It's for that
we're setting out for Emain Macha when the
tide turns on the sand.

NAISI -- _giving in._ -- You're right, maybe.
It should be a poor thing to see great lovers
and they sleepy and old.

DEIRDRE -- _with a more tender intensity._
-- We're seven years without roughness or


61

growing weary; seven years so sweet and
shining, the gods would be hard set to give
us seven days the like of them.  It's for that
we're going to Emain, where there'll be a rest
for ever, or a place for forgetting, in great
crowds and they making a stir.

NAISI -- _very softly._ -- We'll go, surely,
in place of keeping a watch on a love had no
match and it wasting away.  (_They cling to
each other for a moment, then Naisi looks up._)
There are Fergus and Lavarcham and my two
brothers.
[_Deirdre goes.  Naisi sits with his head
bowed.  Owen runs in stealthily, comes
behind Naisi and seizes him round the
arms.  Naisi shakes him off and whips
out his sword._

OWEN -- _screaming with derisive laughter
and showing his empty hands._ -- Ah, Naisi,
wasn't it well I didn't kill you that time?
There was a fright you got!  I've been watch-
ing Fergus above -- don't be frightened --
and I've come down to see him getting the
cold shoulder, and going off alone.
[_Fergus and others come in.  They are
all subdued like men at a queen's wake._

NAISI -- _putting up his sword._ -- There


62

he is.  (_Goes to Fergus._)  We are going back
when the tide turns, I and Deirdre with your-
self.

ALL.  Going back!

AINNLE.  And you'll end your life with
Deirdre, though she has no match for keeping
spirits in a little company is far away by itself?

ARDAN.  It's seven years myself and
Ainnle have been servants and bachelors for
yourself and Deirdre.  Why will you take her
back to Conchubor?

NAISI.  I have done what Deirdre wishes
and has chosen.

FERGUS.  You've made a choice wise men
will be glad of in the five ends of Ireland.

OWEN.  Wise men is it, and they going
back to Conchubor?  I could stop them only
Naisi put in his sword among my father's ribs,
and when a man's done that he'll not credit
your oath.  Going to Conchubor!  I could tell
of plots and tricks, and spies were well paid
for their play.  (_He throws up a bag of gold._)
Are you paid, Fergus?
[_He scatters gold pieces over Fergus._

FERGUS.  He is raving. . . .  Seize him.

OWEN -- _flying between them._ -- You
won't.  Let the lot of you be off to Emain, but
I'll be off before you. . . .  Dead men, dead


63

men!  Men who'll die for Deirdre's beauty;
I'll be before you in the grave!
[_Runs out with his knife in his hand.
They all run after him except Lavar-
cham, who looks out and then clasps
her hands.  Deirdre comes out to her
in a dark cloak._

DEIRDRE.  What has happened?

LAVARCHAM.  It's Owen's gone raging
mad, and he's after splitting his gullet beyond
at the butt of the stone.  There was ill luck
this day in his eye.  And he knew a power if
he'd said it all.
[_Naisi comes back quickly, followed by
the others._

AINNLE -- _coming in very excited._ --
That man knew plots of Conchubor's.  We'll
not go to Emain, where Conchubor may love
her and have hatred for yourself.

FERGUS.  Would you mind a fool and
raver?

AINNLE.  It's many times there's more
sense in madmen than the wise.  We will not
obey Conchubor.

NAISI.  I and Deirdre have chosen; we
will go back with Fergus.

ARDAN.  We will not go back.  We will
burn your curaghs by the sea.


64


FERGUS.  My sons and I will guard
them.

AINNLE.  We will blow the horn of Usna
and our friends will come to aid us.

NAISI.  It is my friends will come.

AINNLE.  Your friends will bind your
hands, and you out of your wits.
[_Deirdre comes forward quickly and
comes between Ainnle and Naisi.

DEIRDRE -- _in a low voice._ -- For seven
years the Sons of Usna have not raised their
voices in a quarrel.

AINNLE.  We will not take you to Emain.

ARDAN.  It is Conchubor has broken our
peace.

AINNLE -- _to Deirdre._ -- Stop Naisi go-
ing.  What way would we live if Conchubor
should take you from us?

DEIRDRE.  There is no one could take
me from you.  I have chosen to go back with
Fergus.  Will you quarrel with me, Ainnle,
though I have been your queen these seven
years in Alban?

AINNLE -- _subsiding suddenly._ -- Naisi
has no call to take you.

ARDAN.  Why are you going?

DEIRDRE -- _to both of them and the_


65

_others._ -- It is my wish. . . .  It may be I will
not have Naisi growing an old man in Alban
with an old woman at his side, and young girls
pointing out and saying, "that is Deirdre and
Naisi had great beauty in their youth."  It
may be we do well putting a sharp end to the
day is brave and glorious, as our fathers put
a sharp end to the days of the kings of Ire-
land; or that I'm wishing to set my foot on
Slieve Fuadh, where I was running one time
and leaping the streams, (_to Lavarcham_) and
that I'd be well pleased to see our little apple-
trees, Lavarcham, behind our cabin on the hill;
or that I've learned, Fergus, it's a lonesome
thing to be away from Ireland always.

AINNLE -- _giving in._ -- There is no place
but will be lonesome to us from this out, and
we thinking on our seven years in Alban.

DEIRDRE -- _to Naisi._ -- It's in this place
we'd be lonesome in the end. . . .  Take down
Fergus to the sea.  He has been a guest had a
hard welcome and he bringing messages of
peace.

FERGUS.  We will make your curagh
ready and it fitted for the voyage of a king.
[_He goes with Naisi._

DEIRDRE.  Take your spears, Ainnle and
Ardan, and go down before me, and take your


66

horse-boys to be carrying my cloaks are on the
threshold.

AINNLE -- _obeying._ -- It's with a poor
heart we'll carry your things this day we have
carried merrily so often, and we hungry and
cold.
[_They gather up things and go out._

DEIRDRE -- _to Lavarcham._ -- Go you,
too, Lavarcham.  You are old, and I will
follow quickly.

LAVARCHAM.  I'm old, surely, and the
hopes I had my pride in are broken and torn.
[_She goes out, with a look of awe at
Deirdre._

DEIRDRE -- _clasping her hands._ -- Woods
of Cuan, woods of Cuan, dear country of the
east!  It's seven years we've had a life was
joy only, and this day we're going west, this
day we're facing death, maybe, and death
should be a poor, untidy thing, though it's a
queen that dies.
[_She goes out slowly._



CURTAIN





ACT III.

_Tent below Emain Macha._


[page intentionally blank]


_Tent below Emain, with shabby skins and
benches.  There is an opening at each side and
at back, the latter closed.  Old Woman comes
in with food and fruits and arranges them on
table.  Conchubor comes in on right._

CONCHUBOR -- _sharply._ -- Has no one
come with news for me?

OLD WOMAN.  I've seen no one at all,
Conchubor.

CONCHUBOR -- _watches her working
for a moment, then makes sure opening at back
is closed._ -- Go up then to Emain, you're not
wanting here.  (_A noise heard left._)  Who
is that?

OLD WOMAN -- _going left._ -- It's Lavar-
cham coming again.  She's a great wonder for
jogging back and forward through the world,
and I made certain she'd be off to meet them;
but she's coming alone, Conchubor, my dear
child Deirdre isn't with her at all.

CONCHUBOR.  Go up so and leave us.

OLD WOMAN -- _pleadingly._ -- I'd be well
pleased to set my eyes on Deirdre if she's
coming this night, as we're told.


68


CONCHUBOR -- _impatiently._ -- It's not
long till you'll see her.  But I've matters with
Lavarcham, and let you go now, I'm saying.
[_He shows her out right, as Lavarcham
comes in on the left._

LAVARCHAM -- _looking round her with
suspicion._ -- This is a queer place to find you,
and it's a queer place to be lodging Naisi and
his brothers, and Deirdre with them, and the
lot of us tired out with the long way we have
been walking.

CONCHUBOR.  You've come along with
them the whole journey?

LAVARCHAM.  I have, then, though
I've no call now to be wandering that length
to a wedding or a burial, or the two together.
(_She sits down wearily._)  It's a poor thing
the way me and you is getting old, Conchubor,
and I'm thinking you yourself have no call to
be loitering this place getting your death, may-
be, in the cold of night.

CONCHUBOR.  I'm waiting only to know
is Fergus stopped in the north.

LAVARCHAM -- _more sharply._ -- He's
stopped, surely, and that's a trick has me
thinking you have it in mind to bring trouble
this night on Emain and Ireland and the big
world's east beyond them.  (_She goes to him._)


69

And yet you'd do well to be going to your
dun, and not putting shame on her meeting
the High King, and she seamed and sweaty
and in great disorder from the dust of many
roads.  (_Laughing derisively._)  Ah, Conchu-
bor, my lad, beauty goes quickly in the woods,
and you'd let a great gasp, I tell you, if you
set your eyes this night on Deirdre.

CONCHUBOR -- _fiercely._ -- It's little I
care if she's white and worn, for it's I did rear
her from a child.  I should have a good right
to meet and see her always.

LAVARCHAM.  A good right is it?
Haven't the blind a good right to be seeing,
and the lame to be dancing, and the dummies
singing tunes?  It's that right you have to be
looking for gaiety on Deirdre's lips.  (_Coax-
ingly._)  Come on to your dun, I'm saying,
and leave her quiet for one night itself.

CONCHUBOR -- _with sudden anger._ --
I'll not go, when it's long enough I am above
in my dun stretching east and west without a
comrade, and I more needy, maybe, than the
thieves of Meath. . . .  You think I'm old
and wise, but I tell you the wise know the old
must die, and they'll leave no chance for a
thing slipping from them they've set their
blood to win.


70


LAVARCHAM -- _nodding her head._ -- If
you're old and wise, it's I'm the same, Conchu-
bor, and I'm telling you you'll not have her
though you're ready to destroy mankind and
skin the gods to win her.  There's things a
king can't have, Conchubor, and if you go
rampaging this night you'll be apt to win
nothing but death for many, and a sloppy
face of trouble on your own self before the
day will come.

CONCHUBOR.  It's too much talk you
have.  (_Goes right._)  Where is Owen?  Did
you see him no place and you coming the road?

LAVARCHAM.  I seen him surely.  He
went spying on Naisi, and now the worms is
spying on his own inside.

CONCHUBOR -- _exultingly._ -- Naisi killed
him?

LAVARCHAM.  He did not, then.  It
was Owen destroyed himself running mad be-
cause of Deirdre.  Fools and kings and
scholars are all one in a story with her like,
and Owen thought he'd be a great man, being
the first corpse in the game you'll play this
night in Emain.

CONCHUBOR.  It's yourself should be
the first corpse, but my other messengers are
coming, men from the clans that hated Usna.


71


LAVARCHAM -- _drawing back hopeless-
ly._ -- Then the gods have pity on us all!
[_Men with weapons come in._

CONCHUBOR -- _to Soldiers._ -- Are Ain-
nle and Ardan separate from Naisi?

MEN.  They are, Conchubor.  We've got
them off, saying they were needed to make
ready Deirdre's house.

CONCHUBOR.  And Naisi and Deirdre
are coming?

SOLDIER.  Naisi's coming, surely, and a
woman with him is putting out the glory of
the moon is rising and the sun is going down.

CONCHUBOR -- _looking at Lavarcham._
-- That's your story that she's seamed and
ugly?

SOLDIER.  I have more news.  (_Point-
ing to Lavarcham._)  When that woman heard
you were bringing Naisi this place, she sent
a horse-boy to call Fergus from the north.

CONCHUBOR -- _to Lavarcham._ -- It's for
that you've been playing your tricks, but what
you've won is a nearer death for Naisi.  (_To
Soldiers._)  Go up and call my fighters, and
take that woman up to Emain.

LAVARCHAM.  I'd liefer stay this place.
I've done my best, but if a bad end is coming,


72

surely it would be a good thing maybe I was
here to tend her.

CONCHUBOR -- _fiercely._ -- Take her to
Emain; it's too many tricks she's tried this day
already.  (_A Soldier goes to her._)

LAVARCHAM.  Don't touch me.  (_She
puts her cloak round her and catches Con-
chubor's arm._)  I thought to stay your hand
with my stories till Fergus would come to be
beside them, the way I'd save yourself, Con-
chubor, and Naisi and Emain Macha; but I'll
walk up now into your halls, and I'll say (_with
a gesture_) it's here nettles will be growing,
and beyond thistles and docks.  I'll go into
your high chambers, where you've been figur-
ing yourself stretching out your neck for the
kisses of a queen of women; and I'll say it's
here there'll be deer stirring and goats scratch-
ing, and sheep waking and coughing when
there is a great wind from the north.  (_Shak-
ing herself loose.  Conchubor makes a sign to
Soldiers._)  I'm going, surely.  In a short space
I'll be sitting up with many listening to the
flames crackling, and the beams breaking, and
I looking on the great blaze will be the end of
Emain.                          [_She goes out._

CONCHUBOR -- _looking out._ -- I see two
people in the trees; it should be Naisi and


73

Deirdre.  (_To Soldier._)  Let you tell them
they'll lodge here tonight.
[_Conchubor goes out right.  Naisi and
Deirdre come in on left, very weary._

NAISI -- _to Soldiers._ -- Is it this place he's
made ready for myself and Deirdre?

SOLDIER.  The Red Branch House is
being aired and swept and you'll be called
there when a space is by; till then you'd find
fruits and drink on this table, and so the gods
be with you.                   [_Goes out right._

NAISI -- _looking round._ -- It's a strange
place he's put us camping and we come back
as his friends.

DEIRDRE.  He's likely making up a wel-
come for us, having curtains shaken out and
rich rooms put in order; and it's right he'd
have great state to meet us, and you his sister's
son.

NAISI -- _gloomily._ -- It's little we want
with state or rich rooms or curtains, when
we're used to the ferns only and cold streams
and they making a stir.

DEIRDRE -- _roaming round room._ -- We
want what is our right in Emain (_looking at
hangings_), and though he's riches in store for
us it's a shabby, ragged place he's put us wait-


74

ing, with frayed rugs and skins are eaten by
the moths.

NAISI -- _a little impatiently._ -- There are
few would worry over skins and moths on this
first night that we've come back to Emain.

DEIRDRE -- _brightly._ -- You should be
well pleased it's for that I'd worry all times,
when it's I have kept your tent these seven
years as tidy as a bee-hive or a linnet's nest.
If Conchubor'd a queen like me in Emain he'd
not have stretched these rags to meet us.  (_She
pulls hanging, and it opens._)  There's new
earth on the ground and a trench dug. . . .
It's a grave, Naisi, that is wide and deep.

NAISI -- _goes over and pulls back curtain
showing grave._ -- And that'll be our home in
Emain. . . .  He's dug it wisely at the butt
of a hill, with fallen trees to hide it.  He'll
want to have us killed and buried before
Fergus comes.

DEIRDRE.  Take me away. . . .  Take
me to hide in the rocks, for the night is coming
quickly.

NAISI -- _pulling himself together._ -- I will
not leave my brothers.

DEIRDRE -- _vehemently._ -- It's of us two
he's jealous.  Come away to the places where
we're used to have our company. . . .


75

Wouldn't it be a good thing to lie hid in the
high ferns together?  (_She pulls him left._)  I
hear strange words in the trees.

NAISI.  It should be the strange fighters
of Conchubor.  I saw them passing as we
came.

DEIRDRE -- _pulling him towards the
right._ -- Come to this side.  Listen, Naisi!

NAISI.  There are more of them. . . .
We are shut in, and I have not Ainnle and
Ardan to stand near me.  Isn't it a hard thing
that we three who have conquered many may
not die together?

DEIRDRE -- _sinking down._ -- And isn't
it a hard thing that you and I are in this place
by our opened grave; though none have lived
had happiness like ours those days in Alban
that went by so quick.

NAISI.  It's a hard thing, surely, we've
lost those days for ever; and yet it's a good
thing, maybe, that all goes quick, for when
I'm in that grave it's soon a day'll come you'll
be too wearied to be crying out, and that day'll
bring you ease.

DEIRDRE.  I'll not be here to know if
that is true.

NAISI.  It's our three selves he'll kill to-
night, and then in two months or three you'll


76

see him walking down for courtship with
yourself.

DEIRDRE.  I'll not be here.

NAISI -- _hard._ -- You'd best keep him off,
maybe, and then, when the time comes, make
your way to some place west in Donegal, and
it's there you'll get used to stretching out
lonesome at the fall of night, and waking lone-
some for the day.

DEIRDRE.  Let you not be saying things
are worse than death.

NAISI -- _a little recklessly._ -- I've one
word left.  If a day comes in the west that the
larks are cocking their crests on the edge of
the clouds, and the cuckoos making a stir, and
there's a man you'd fancy, let you not be
thinking that day I'd be well pleased you'd go
on keening always.

DEIRDRE -- _turning to look at him._ --
And if it was I that died, Naisi, would you
take another woman to fill up my place?

NAISI -- _very mournfully._ -- It's little I
know, saving only that it's a hard and bitter
thing leaving the earth, and a worse and
harder thing leaving yourself alone and deso-
late to be making lamentation on its face
always.

DEIRDRE.  I'll die when you do, Naisi.


77

I'd not have come here from Alban but I
knew I'd be along with you in Emain, and you
living or dead. . . .  Yet this night it's
strange and distant talk you're making only.

NAISI.  There's nothing, surely, the like
of a new grave of open earth for putting a
great space between two friends that love.

DEIRDRE.  If there isn't, it's that grave
when it's closed will make us one for ever, and
we two lovers have had great space without
weariness or growing old or any sadness of
the mind.

CONCHUBOR -- _coming in on right._ --
I'd bid you welcome, Naisi.

NAISI -- _standing up._ -- You're welcome,
Conchubor.  I'm well pleased you've come.

CONCHUBOR -- _blandly._ -- Let you not
think bad of this place where I've put you till
other rooms are readied.

NAISI -- _breaking out._ -- We know the
room you've readied.  We know what stirred
you to send your seals and Fergus into Alban
and stop him in the north, (_opening curtain
and pointing to the grave_) and dig that grave
before us.  Now I ask what brought you here?

CONCHUBOR.  I've come to look on
Deirdre.

NAISI.  Look on her.  You're a knacky


78

fancier, and it's well you chose the one you'd
lure from Alban.  Look on her, I tell you,
and when you've looked I've got ten fingers
will squeeze your mottled goose neck, though
you're king itself.

DEIRDRE -- _coming between them._ --
Hush, Naisi!  Maybe Conchubor'll make
peace. . . .  Do not mind him, Conchubor;
he has cause to rage.

CONCHUBOR.  It's little I heed his rag-
ing, when a call would bring my fighters from
the trees. . . .  But what do you say, Deirdre?

DEIRDRE.  I'll say so near that grave we
seem three lonesome people, and by a new
made grave there's no man will keep brooding
on a woman's lips, or on the man he hates.
It's not long till your own grave will be dug
in Emain, and you'd go down to it more easy
if you'd let call Ainnle and Ardan, the way
we'd have a supper all together, and fill that
grave, and you'll be well pleased from this out,
having four new friends the like of us in
Emain.

CONCHUBOR -- _looking at her for a
moment._ -- That's the first friendly word I've
heard you speaking, Deirdre.  A game the like
of yours should be the proper thing for soften-
ing the heart and putting sweetness in the


79

tongue; and yet this night when I hear you
I've small blame left for Naisi that he stole
you off from Ulster.

DEIRDRE -- _to Naisi._ -- Now, Naisi,
answer gently, and we'll be friends to-night.

NAISI -- _doggedly._ -- I have no call but to
be friendly.  I'll answer what you will.

DEIRDRE -- _taking Naisi's hand._ -- Then
you'll call Conchubor your friend and king,
the man who reared me up upon Slieve Fuadh.
[_As Conchubor is going to clasp Naisi's
hand cries are heard behind._

CONCHUBOR.  What noise is that?

AINNLE -- _behind._ -- Naisi.  . . . .  Naisi.
Come to us; we are betrayed and broken.

NAISI.  It's Ainnle crying out in a battle.

CONCHUBOR.  I was near won this
night, but death's between us now.
[_He goes out._

DEIRDRE -- _clinging to Naisi._ -- There is
no battle. . . .  Do not leave me, Naisi.

NAISI.  I must go to them.

DEIRDRE -- _beseechingly._ -- Do not leave
me, Naisi.  Let us creep up in the darkness
behind the grave.  If there's a battle, maybe
the strange fighters will be destroyed, when
Ainnle and Ardan are against them.
[_Cries heard._


80


NAISI -- _wildly._ -- I hear Ardan crying
out.  Do not hold me from my brothers.

DEIRDRE.  Do not leave me, Naisi.  Do
not leave me broken and alone.

NAISI.  I cannot leave my brothers when
it is I who have defied the king.

DEIRDRE.  I will go with you.

NAISI.  You cannot come.  Do not hold
me from the fight.
[_He throws her aside almost roughly._

DEIRDRE -- _with restraint._ -- Go to your
brothers.  For seven years you have been
kindly, but the hardness of death has come
between us.

NAISI -- _looking at her aghast._ -- And
you'll have me meet death with a hard word
from your lips in my ear?

DEIRDRE.  We've had a dream, but this
night has waked us surely.  In a little while
we've lived too long, Naisi, and isn't it a poor
thing we should miss the safety of the grave,
and we trampling its edge?

AINNLE -- _behind._ -- Naisi, Naisi, we are
attacked and ruined!

DEIRDRE.  Let you go where they are
calling.  (_She looks at him for an instant
coldly._)  Have you no shame loitering and


81

talking, and a cruel death facing Ainnle and
Ardan in the woods?

NAISI -- _frantic._ -- They'll not get a death
that's cruel, and they with men alone.  It's
women that have loved are cruel only; and if
I went on living from this day I'd be putting
a curse on the lot of them I'd meet walking in
the east or west, putting a curse on the sun that
gave them beauty, and on the madder and the
stone-crop put red upon their cloaks.

DEIRDRE -- _bitterly._ -- I'm well pleased
there's no one in this place to make a story that
Naisi was a laughing-stock the night he died.

NAISI.  There'd not be many'd make a
story, for that mockery is in your eyes this
night will spot the face of Emain with a
plague of pitted graves.    [_He goes out._

CONCHUBOR -- _outside._ -- That is Naisi.
Strike him!  (_Tumult.  Deirdre crouches down
on Naisi's cloak.  Conchubor comes in
hurriedly._)  They've met their death -- the
three that stole you, Deirdre, and from this
out you'll be my queen in Emain.
[_A keen of men's voices is heard behind._

DEIRDRE -- _bewildered and terrified._ --
It is not I will be a queen.

CONCHUBOR.  Make your lamentation
a short while if you will, but it isn't long till


82

a day'll come when you begin pitying a man
is old and desolate, and High King also. . . .
Let you not fear me, for it's I'm well pleased
you have a store of pity for the three that were
your friends in Alban.

DEIRDRE.  I have pity, surely. . . .  It's
the way pity has me this night, when I think
of Naisi, that I could set my teeth into the
heart of a king.

CONCHUBOR.  I know well pity's cruel,
when it was my pity for my own self destroyed
Naisi.

DEIRDRE -- _more wildly._ -- It was my
words without pity gave Naisi a death will
have no match until the ends of life and time.
(_Breaking out into a keen._)  But who'll pity
Deirdre has lost the lips of Naisi from her
neck and from her cheek for ever?  Who'll
pity Deirdre has lost the twilight in the woods
with Naisi, when beech-trees were silver and
copper, and ash-trees were fine gold?

CONCHUBOR -- _bewildered._ -- It's I'll
know the way to pity and care you, and I with
a share of troubles has me thinking this night
it would be a good bargain if it was I was in
the grave, and Deirdre crying over me, and
it was Naisi who was old and desolate.
[_Keen heard._


83


DEIRDRE -- _wild with sorrow._ -- It is I
who am desolate; I, Deirdre, that will not live
till I am old.

CONCHUBOR.  It's not long you'll be
desolate, and I seven years saying, "It's a
bright day for Deirdre in the woods of
Alban"; or saying again, "What way will
Deirdre be sleeping this night, and wet leaves
and branches driving from the north?"  Let
you not break the thing I've set my life on, and
you giving yourself up to your sorrow when
it's joy and sorrow do burn out like straw
blazing in an east wind.

DEIRDRE -- _turning on him._ -- Was it
that way with your sorrow, when I and Naisi
went northward from Slieve Fuadh and let
raise our sails for Alban?

CONCHUBOR.  There's one sorrow has
no end surely -- that's being old and lone-
some.  (_With extraordinary pleading._)  But
you and I will have a little peace in Emain,
with harps playing, and old men telling stories
at the fall of night.  I've let build rooms
for our two selves, Deirdre, with red gold
upon the walls and ceilings that are set with
bronze.  There was never a queen in the east
had a house the like of your house, that's wait-
ing for yourself in Emain.


84


SOLDIER -- _running in._ -- Emain is in
flames.  Fergus has come back and is setting
fire to the world.  Come up, Conchubor, or
your state will be destroyed!

CONCHUBOR -- _angry and regal again._
-- Are the Sons of Usna buried?

SOLDIER.  They are in their grave, but
no earth is thrown.

CONCHUBOR.  Let me see them.  Open
the tent!  (_Soldier opens back of tent and
shows grave._)  Where are my fighters?

SOLDIER.  They are gone to Emain.

CONCHUBOR -- _to Deirdre._ -- There are
none to harm you.  Stay here until I come
again.
[_Goes out with Soldier.  Deirdre looks
round for a moment, then goes up slow-
ly and looks into grave.  She crouches
down and begins swaying herself
backwards and forwards, keening soft-
ly.  At first her words are not heard,
then they become clear._

DEIRDRE.  It's you three will not see age
or death coming -- you that were my com-
pany when the fires on the hill-tops were put
out and the stars were our friends only.  I'll
turn my thoughts back from this night, that's


85

pitiful for want of pity, to the time it was
your rods and cloaks made a little tent for me
where there'd be a birch tree making shelter
and a dry stone; though from this day my own
fingers will be making a tent for me, spreading
out my hairs and they knotted with the rain.
[_Lavarcham and Old Woman come in
stealthily on right._

DEIRDRE -- _not seeing them._ -- It is I,
Deirdre, will be crouching in a dark place; I,
Deirdre, that was young with Naisi, and
brought sorrow to his grave in Emain.

OLD WOMAN.  Is that Deirdre broken
down that was so light and airy?

LAVARCHAM.  It is, surely, crying out
over their grave.   [_She goes to Deirdre._

DEIRDRE.  It will be my share from this
out to be making lamentation on his stone
always, and I crying for a love will be the like
of a star shining on a little harbour by the sea.

LAVARCHAM -- _coming forward._ -- Let
you rise up, Deirdre, and come off while there
are none to heed us, the way I'll find you
shelter and some friend to guard you.

DEIRDRE.  To what place would I go
away from Naisi?  What are the woods with-
out Naisi or the sea shore?


86


LAVARCHAM -- _very coaxingly._ -- If it
is that way you'd be, come till I find you a
sunny place where you'll be a great wonder
they'll call the queen of sorrows; and you'll
begin taking a pride to be sitting up pausing
and dreaming when the summer comes.

DEIRDRE.  It was the voice of Naisi that
was strong in summer -- the voice of Naisi
that was sweeter than pipes playing, but from
this day will be dumb always.

LAVARCHAM -- _to Old Woman._ -- She
doesn't heed us at all.  We'll be hard set to
rouse her.

OLD WOMAN.  If we don't the High
King will rouse her, coming down beside her
with the rage of battle in his blood, for how
could Fergus stand against him?

LAVARCHAM -- _touching Deirdre with
her hand._ -- There's a score of woman's years
in store for you, and you'd best choose will
you start living them beside the man you hate,
or being your own mistress in the west or
south?

DEIRDRE.  It is not I will go on living
after Ainnle and after Ardan.  After Naisi I
will not have a lifetime in the world.

OLD WOMAN -- _with excitement._ -- Look,
Lavarcham!  There's a light leaving the Red


87

Branch.  Conchubor and his lot will be com-
ing quickly with a torch of bog-deal for her
marriage, throwing a light on her three com-
rades.

DEIRDRE -- _startled._ -- Let us throw down
clay on my three comrades.  Let us cover up
Naisi along with Ainnle and Ardan, they that
were the pride of Emain.  (_Throwing in
clay._)  There is Naisi was the best of three,
the choicest of the choice of many.  It was a
clean death was your share, Naisi; and it is
not I will quit your head, when it's many a
dark night among the snipe and plover that
you and I were whispering together.  It is
not I will quit your head, Naisi, when it's
many a night we saw the stars among the clear
trees of Glen da Ruadh, or the moon pausing
to rest her on the edges of the hills.

OLD WOMAN.  Conchubor is coming,
surely.  I see the glare of flames throwing a
light upon his cloak.

LAVARCHAM -- _eagerly._ -- Rise up,
Deirdre, and come to Fergus, or be the High
King's slave for ever!

DEIRDRE -- _imperiously._ -- I will not
leave Naisi, who has left the whole world
scorched and desolate.  I will not go away
when there is no light in the heavens, and no


88

flower in the earth under them, but is saying
to me that it is Naisi who is gone for ever.

CONCHUBOR -- _behind._ -- She is here.
Stay a little back.  (_Lavarcham and Old
Woman go into the shadow on left as Con-
chubor comes in.  With excitement, to
Deirdre._)  Come forward and leave Naisi the
way I've left charred timber and a smell of
burning in Emain Macha, and a heap of rub-
bish in the storehouse of many crowns.

DEIRDRE -- _more awake to what is round
her._ -- What are crowns and Emain Macha,
when the head that gave them glory is this
place, Conchubor, and it stretched upon the
gravel will be my bed to-night?

CONCHUBOR.  Make an end of talk of
Naisi, for I've come to bring you to Dundeal-
gan since Emain is destroyed.
[_Conchubor makes a movement towards
her._

DEIRDRE -- _with a tone that stops him._ --
Draw a little back from Naisi, who is young
for ever.  Draw a little back from the white
bodies I am putting under a mound of clay
and grasses that are withered -- a mound will
have a nook for my own self when the end is
come.

CONCHUBOR -- _roughly._ -- Let you rise


89

up and come along with me in place of grow-
ing crazy with your wailings here.

DEIRDRE.  It's yourself has made a crazy
story, and let you go back to your arms, Con-
chubor, and to councils where your name is
great, for in this place you are an old man
and a fool only.

CONCHUBOR.  If I've folly, I've sense
left not to lose the thing I've bought with
sorrow and the deaths of many.
[_He moves towards her._

DEIRDRE.  Do not raise a hand to touch
me.

CONCHUBOR.  There are other hands to
touch you.  My fighters are set round in
among the trees.

DEIRDRE.  Who'll fight the grave, Con-
chubor, and it opened on a dark night?

LAVARCHAM -- _eagerly._ -- There are
steps in the wood.  I hear the call of Fergus
and his men.

CONCHUBOR -- _furiously._ -- Fergus can-
not stop me.  I am more powerful than he is,
though I am defeated and old.

FERGUS -- _comes in to Deirdre; a red
glow is seen behind the grove._ -- I have de-
stroyed Emain, and now I'll guard you all


90

times, Deirdre, though it was I, without
knowledge, brought Naisi to his grave.

CONCHUBOR.  It's not you will guard
her, for my whole armies are gathering.  Rise
up, Deirdre, for you are mine surely.

FERGUS -- _coming between them._ -- I am
come between you.

CONCHUBOR -- _wildly._ -- When I've
killed Naisi and his brothers, is there any man
that I will spare?  And is it you will stand
against me, Fergus, when it's seven years
you've seen me getting my death with rage
in Emain?

FERGUS.  It's I, surely, will stand against
a thief and a traitor.

DEIRDRE -- _stands up and sees the light
from Emain._ -- Draw a little back with the
squabbling of fools when I am broken up
with misery.  (_She turns round._)  I see the
flames of Emain starting upward in the dark
night; and because of me there will be weasels
and wild cats crying on a lonely wall where
there were queens and armies and red gold,
the way there will be a story told of a ruined
city and a raving king and a woman will be
young for ever.  (_She looks round._)  I see
the trees naked and bare, and the moon
shining.  Little moon, little moon of Alban,


91

it's lonesome you'll be this night, and to-
morrow night, and long nights after, and you
pacing the woods beyond Glen Laoi, looking
every place for Deirdre and Naisi, the two
lovers who slept so sweetly with each other.

FERGUS -- _going to Conchubor's right
and whispering._ -- Keep back, or you will have
the shame of pushing a bolt on a queen who is
out of her wits.

CONCHUBOR.  It is I who am out of
my wits, with Emain in flames, and Deirdre
raving, and my own heart gone within me.

DEIRDRE -- _in a high and quiet tone._ --
I have put away sorrow like a shoe that is
worn out and muddy, for it is I have had a life
that will be envied by great companies.  It
was not by a low birth I made kings uneasy,
and they sitting in the halls of Emain.  It
was not a low thing to be chosen by Conchubor,
who was wise, and Naisi had no match for
bravery.  It is not a small thing to be rid of
grey hairs, and the loosening of the teeth.
(_With a sort of triumph._)  It was the choice
of lives we had in the clear woods, and in the
grave, we're safe, surely. . . .

CONCHUBOR.  She will do herself harm.

DEIRDRE -- _showing Naisi's knife._ -- I
have a little key to unlock the prison of Naisi


92

you'd shut upon his youth for ever.  Keep
back, Conchubor; for the High King who is
your master has put his hands between us.
(_She half turns to the grave._)  It was sorrows
were foretold, but great joys were my share
always; yet it is a cold place I must go to be
with you, Naisi; and it's cold your arms will
be this night that were warm about my neck
so often. . . .  It's a pitiful thing to be talk-
ing out when your ears are shut to me.  It's
a pitiful thing, Conchubor, you have done this
night in Emain; yet a thing will be a joy and
triumph to the ends of life and time.
[_She presses knife into her heart and
sinks into the grave.  Conchubor and
Fergus go forward.  The red glow
fades, leaving stage very dark._

FERGUS.  Four white bodies are laid
down together; four clear lights are quenched
in Ireland.  (_He throws his sword into the
grave._)  There is my sword that could not
shield you -- my four friends that were the
dearest always.  The flames of Emain have
gone out: Deirdre is dead and there is none to
keen her.  That is the fate of Deirdre and
the children of Usna, and for this night, Con-
chubor, our war is ended.       [_He goes out._


93


LAVARCHAM.  I have a little hut where
you can rest, Conchubor; there is a great dew
falling.

CONCHUBOR -- _with the voice of an old
man._ -- Take me with you.  I'm hard set to
see the way before me.

OLD WOMAN.  This way, Conchubor.
[_They go out._

LAVARCHAM -- _beside the grave._ --
Deirdre is dead, and Naisi is dead; and if the
oaks and stars could die for sorrow, it's a dark
sky and a hard and naked earth we'd have
this night in Emain.

IN THE SHADOW OF THE GLEN

A PLAY IN ONE ACT


SCENE.--{The last cottage at the head of a long glen in County Wicklow.

Cottage kitchen; turf fire on the right; a bed near it against the wall
with a body lying on it covered with a sheet. A door is at the other
end of the room, with a low table near it, and stools, or wooden chairs.
There are a couple of glasses on the table, and a bottle of whisky, as
if for a wake, with two cups, a teapot, and a home-made cake. There is
another small door near the bed. Nora Burke is moving about the room,
settling a few things, and lighting candles on the table, looking now
and then at the bed with an uneasy look. Some one knocks softly at the
door. She takes up a stocking with money from the table and puts it in
her pocket. Then she opens the door.}

TRAMP {Outside.} Good evening to you, lady of the house.

NORA

Good evening, kindly stranger, it's a wild night, God help you, to be
out in the rain falling.

TRAMP It is, surely, and I walking to Brittas from the Aughrim fair.

NORA Is it walking on your feet, stranger?

TRAMP On my two feet, lady of the house, and when I saw the light below
I thought maybe if you'd a sup of new milk and a quiet decent corner
where a man could sleep {he looks in past her and sees the dead man.}
The Lord have mercy on us all!

NORA It doesn't matter anyway, stranger, come in out of the rain.

TRAMP {Coming in slowly and going towards the bed.} Is it departed he
is?

NORA It is, stranger. He's after dying on me, God forgive him, and there
I am now with a hundred sheep beyond on the hills, and no turf drawn for
the winter.

TRAMP {Looking closely at the dead man.} It's a queer look is on him for
a man that's dead.

NORA {Half-humorously.} He was always queer, stranger, and I suppose
them that's queer and they living men will be queer bodies after.

TRAMP Isn't it a great wonder you're letting him lie there, and he is
not tidied, or laid out itself?

NORA {Coming to the bed.} I was afeard, stranger, for he put a black
curse on me this morning if I'ld touch his body the time he'ld die
sudden, or let any one touch it except his sister only, and it's ten
miles away she lives in the big glen over the hill.

TRAMP {Looking at her and nodding slowly.} It's a queer story he
wouldn't let his own wife touch him, and he dying quiet in his bed.

NORA He was an old man, and an odd man, stranger, and it's always up on
the hills he was thinking thoughts in the dark mist. {She pulls back a
bit of the sheet.} Lay your hand on him now, and tell me if it's cold he
is surely.

TRAMP Is it getting the curse on me you'ld be, woman of the house? I
wouldn't lay my hand on him for the Lough Nahanagan and it filled with
gold.

NORA {Looking uneasily at the body.} Maybe cold would be no sign of
death with the like of him, for he was always cold, every day since I
knew him,--and every night, stranger,--{she covers up his face and comes
away from the bed}; but I'm thinking it's dead he is surely, for he's
complaining a while back of a pain in his heart, and this morning, the
time he was going off to Brittas for three days or four, he was taken
with a sharp turn. Then he went into his bed and he was saying it was
destroyed he was, the time the shadow was going up through the glen, and
when the sun set on the bog beyond he made a great lep, and let a great
cry out of him, and stiffened himself out the like of a dead sheep.

TRAMP {Crosses himself.} God rest his soul.

NORA {Pouring him out a glass of whisky.} Maybe that would do you better
than the milk of the sweetest cow in County Wicklow.

TRAMP The Almighty God reward you, and may it be to your good health.
{He drinks.}

NORA {Giving him a pipe and tobacco.} I've no pipes saving his own,
stranger, but they're sweet pipes to smoke.

TRAMP Thank you kindly, lady of the house.

NORA Sit down now, stranger, and be taking your rest.

TRAMP {Filling a pipe and looking about the room.} I've walked a great
way through the world, lady of the house, and seen great wonders, but I
never seen a wake till this day with fine spirits, and good tobacco, and
the best of pipes, and no one to taste them but a woman only.

NORA Didn't you hear me say it was only after dying on me he was when
the sun went down, and how would I go out into the glen and tell the
neighbours, and I a lone woman with no house near me?

TRAMP {Drinking.} There's no offence, lady of the house?

NORA No offence in life, stranger. How would the like of you, passing
in the dark night, know the lonesome way I was with no house near me at
all?

TRAMP {Sitting down.} I knew rightly. {He lights his pipe so that there
is a sharp light beneath his haggard face.} And I was thinking, and I
coming in through the door, that it's many a lone woman would be afeard
of the like of me in the dark night, in a place wouldn't be so lonesome
as this place, where there aren't two living souls would see the little
light you have shining from the glass.

NORA {Slowly.} I'm thinking many would be afeard, but I never knew what
way I'd be afeard of beggar or bishop or any man of you at all. {She
looks towards the window and lowers her voice.} It's other things than
the like of you, stranger, would make a person afeard.

TRAMP {Looking round with a half-shudder.} It is surely, God help us
all!

NORA {Looking at him for a moment with curiosity.} You're saying that,
stranger, as if you were easy afeard.

TRAMP {Speaking mournfully.} Is it myself, lady of the house, that does
be walking round in the long nights, and crossing the hills when the fog
is on them, the time a little stick would seem as big as your arm, and
a rabbit as big as a bay horse, and a stack of turf as big as a towering
church in the city of Dublin? If myself was easily afeard, I'm telling
you, it's long ago I'ld have been locked into the Richmond Asylum, or
maybe have run up into the back hills with nothing on me but an old
shirt, and been eaten with crows the like of Patch Darcy--the Lord have
mercy on him--in the year that's gone.

NORA {With interest.} You knew Darcy?

TRAMP Wasn't I the last one heard his living voice in the whole world?

NORA There were great stories of what was heard at that time, but would
any one believe the things they do be saying in the glen?

TRAMP It was no lie, lady of the house.... I was passing below on a dark
night the like of this night, and the sheep were lying under the ditch
and every one of them coughing, and choking, like an old man, with the
great rain and the fog. Then I heard a thing talking--queer talk, you
wouldn't believe at all, and you out of your dreams,--and "Merciful
God," says I, "if I begin hearing the like of that voice out of the
thick mist, I'm destroyed surely." Then I run, and I run, and I run,
till I was below in Rathvanna. I got drunk that night, I got drunk
in the morning, and drunk the day after,--I was coming from the races
beyond--and the third day they found Darcy.... Then I knew it was
himself I was after hearing, and I wasn't afeard any more.

NORA {Speaking sorrowfully and slowly.} God spare Darcy, he'ld always
look in here and he passing up or passing down, and it's very lonesome
I was after him a long while {she looks over at the bed and lowers her
voice, speaking very clearly,} and then I got happy again--if it's ever
happy we are, stranger,--for I got used to being lonesome. {A short
pause; then she stands up.}

NORA Was there any one on the last bit of the road, stranger, and you
coming from Aughrim?

TRAMP There was a young man with a drift of mountain ewes, and he
running after them this way and that.

NORA {With a half-smile.} Far down, stranger?

TRAMP A piece only.

{She fills the kettle and puts it on the fire.}

NORA Maybe, if you're not easy afeard, you'ld stay here a short while
alone with himself.

TRAMP I would surely. A man that's dead can do no hurt.

NORA {Speaking with a sort of constraint.} I'm going a little back to
the west, stranger, for himself would go there one night and another
and whistle at that place, and then the young man you're after
seeing--a kind of a farmer has come up from the sea to live in a cottage
beyond--would walk round to see if there was a thing we'ld have to be
done, and I'm wanting him this night, the way he can go down into the
glen when the sun goes up and tell the people that himself is dead.

TRAMP {Looking at the body in the sheet.} It's myself will go for him,
lady of the house, and let you not be destroying yourself with the great
rain.

NORA You wouldn't find your way, stranger, for there's a small path
only, and it running up between two sluigs where an ass and cart would
be drowned. {She puts a shawl over her head.} Let you be making yourself
easy, and saying a prayer for his soul, and it's not long I'll be coming
again.

TRAMP {Moving uneasily.} Maybe if you'd a piece of a grey thread and a
sharp needle--there's great safety in a needle, lady of the house--I'ld
be putting a little stitch here and there in my old coat, the time I'll
be praying for his soul, and it going up naked to the saints of God.

NORA {Takes a needle and thread from the front of her dress and gives
it to him.} There's the needle, stranger, and I'm thinking you won't be
lonesome, and you used to the back hills, for isn't a dead man itself
more company than to be sitting alone, and hearing the winds crying, and
you not knowing on what thing your mind would stay?

TRAMP {Slowly.} It's true, surely, and the Lord have mercy on us all!

{Nora goes out. The Tramp begins stitching one of the tags in his coat,
saying the "De Profundis" under his breath. In an instant the sheet is
drawn slowly down, and Dan Burke looks out. The Tramp moves uneasily,
then looks up, and springs to his feet with a movement of terror.}

DAN {With a hoarse voice.} Don't be afeard, stranger; a man that's dead
can do no hurt.

TRAMP {Trembling.} I meant no harm, your honour; and won't you leave me
easy to be saying a little prayer for your soul?

{A long whistle is heard outside.}

DAN {Sitting up in his bed and speaking fiercely.} Ah, the devil mend
her.... Do you hear that, stranger? Did ever you hear another woman
could whistle the like of that with two fingers in her mouth? {He looks
at the table hurriedly.} I'm destroyed with the drouth, and let you
bring me a drop quickly before herself will come back.

TRAMP {Doubtfully.} Is it not dead you are?

DAN How would I be dead, and I as dry as a baked bone, stranger?

TRAMP {Pouring out the whisky.} What will herself say if she smells the
stuff on you, for I'm thinking it's not for nothing you're letting on to
be dead?

DAN It is not, stranger, but she won't be coming near me at all, and
it's not long now I'll be letting on, for I've a cramp in my back, and
my hip's asleep on me, and there's been the devil's own fly itching my
nose. It's near dead I was wanting to sneeze, and you blathering about
the rain, and Darcy {bitterly}--the devil choke him--and the towering
church. {Crying out impatiently.} Give me that whisky. Would you have
herself come back before I taste a drop at all?

{Tramp gives him the glass.}

DAN {After drinking.} Go over now to that cupboard, and bring me a black
stick you'll see in the west corner by the wall.

TRAMP {Taking a stick from the cupboard} Is it that?

DAN It is, stranger; it's a long time I'm keeping that stick for I've a
bad wife in the house.

TRAMP {With a queer look.} Is it herself, master of the house, and she a
grand woman to talk?

DAN It's herself, surely, it's a bad wife she is--a bad wife for an old
man, and I'm getting old, God help me, though I've an arm to me still.
{He takes the stick in his hand.} Let you wait now a short while, and
it's a great sight you'll see in this room in two hours or three. {He
stops to listen.} Is that somebody above?

TRAMP {Listening.} There's a voice speaking on the path.

DAN Put that stick here in the bed and smooth the sheet the way it was
lying. {He covers himself up hastily.} Be falling to sleep now and don't
let on you know anything, or I'll be having your life. I wouldn't have
told you at all but it's destroyed with the drouth I was.

TRAMP {Covering his head.} Have no fear, master of the house. What is it
I know of the like of you that I'ld be saying a word or putting out my
hand to stay you at all?

{He goes back to the fire, sits down on a stool with his back to the bed
and goes on stitching his coat.}

DAN {Under the sheet, querulously.} Stranger.

TRAMP {Quickly.} Whisht, whisht. Be quiet I'm telling you, they're
coming now at the door.

{Nora comes in with Micheal Dara, a tall, innocent young man behind
her.}

NORA I wasn't long at all, stranger, for I met himself on the path.

TRAMP You were middling long, lady of the house.

NORA There was no sign from himself?

TRAMP No sign at all, lady of the house.

NORA {To Micheal.} Go over now and pull down the sheet, and look on
himself, Micheal Dara, and you'll see it's the truth I'm telling you.

MICHEAL I will not, Nora, I do be afeard of the dead.

{He sits down on a stool next the table facing the tramp. Nora puts the
kettle on a lower hook of the pot hooks, and piles turf under it.}

NORA {Turning to Tramp.} Will you drink a sup of tea with myself and the
young man, stranger, or {speaking more persuasively} will you go into
the little room and stretch yourself a short while on the bed, I'm
thinking it's destroyed you are walking the length of that way in the
great rain.

TRAMP Is it to go away and leave you, and you having a wake, lady of the
house? I will not surely. {He takes a drink from his glass which he has
beside him.} And it's none of your tea I'm asking either.

{He goes on stitching. Nora makes the tea.}

MICHEAL {After looking at the tramp rather scornfully for a moment.}
That's a poor coat you have, God help you, and I'm thinking it's a poor
tailor you are with it.

TRAMP If it's a poor tailor I am, I'm thinking it's a poor herd does be
running back and forward after a little handful of ewes the way I seen
yourself running this day, young fellow, and you coming from the fair.

{Nora comes back to the table.}

NORA {To Micheal in a low voice.} Let you not mind him at all, Micheal
Dara, he has a drop taken and it's soon he'll be falling asleep.

MICHEAL It's no lie he's telling, I was destroyed surely. They were that
wilful they were running off into one man's bit of oats, and another
man's bit of hay, and tumbling into the red bogs till it's more like a
pack of old goats than sheep they were. Mountain ewes is a queer breed,
Nora Burke, and I'm not used to them at all.

NORA {Settling the tea things.} There's no one can drive a mountain ewe
but the men do be reared in the Glen Malure, I've heard them say, and
above by Rathvanna, and the Glen Imaal, men the like of Patch Darcy, God
spare his soul, who would walk through five hundred sheep and miss one
of them, and he not reckoning them at all.

MICHEAL {Uneasily.} Is it the man went queer in his head the year that's
gone?

NORA It is surely.

TRAMP {Plaintively.} That was a great man, young fellow, a great man I'm
telling you. There was never a lamb from his own ewes he wouldn't know
before it was marked, and he'ld run from this to the city of Dublin and
never catch for his breath.

NORA {Turning round quickly.} He was a great man surely, stranger, and
isn't it a grand thing when you hear a living man saying a good word of
a dead man, and he mad dying?

TRAMP It's the truth I'm saying, God spare his soul.

{He puts the needle under the collar of his coat, and settles himself
to sleep in the chimney-corner. Nora sits down at the table; their backs
are turned to the bed.}

MICHEAL {Looking at her with a queer look.} I heard tell this day, Nora
Burke, that it was on the path below Patch Darcy would be passing up and
passing down, and I heard them say he'ld never past it night or morning
without speaking with yourself.

NORA {In a low voice.} It was no lie you heard, Micheal Dara.

MICHEAL I'm thinking it's a power of men you're after knowing if it's in
a lonesome place you live itself.

NORA {Giving him his tea.} It's in a lonesome place you do have to be
talking with some one, and looking for some one, in the evening of the
day, and if it's a power of men I'm after knowing they were fine men,
for I was a hard child to please, and a hard girl to please {she looks
at him a little sternly}, and it's a hard woman I am to please this day,
Micheal Dara, and it's no lie I'm telling you.

MICHEAL {Looking over to see that the tramp is asleep, and then pointing
to the dead man.} Was it a hard woman to please you were when you took
himself for your man?

NORA What way would I live and I an old woman if I didn't marry a man
with a bit of a farm, and cows on it, and sheep on the back hills?

MICHEAL {Considering.} That's true, Nora, and maybe it's no fool you
were, for there's good grazing on it, if it is a lonesome place, and I'm
thinking it's a good sum he's left behind. 28

NORA {Taking the stocking with money from her pocket, and putting it on
the table.} I do be thinking in the long nights it was a big fool I was
that time, Micheal Dara, for what good is a bit of a farm with cows on
it, and sheep on the back hills, when you do be sitting looking out from
a door the like of that door, and seeing nothing but the mists rolling
down the bog, and the mists again, and they rolling up the bog, and
hearing nothing but the wind crying out in the bits of broken trees were
left from the great storm, and the streams roaring with the rain.

MICHEAL {Looking at her uneasily.} What is it ails you, this night, Nora
Burke? I've heard tell it's the like of that talk you do hear from men,
and they after being a great while on the back hills.

NORA {Putting out the money on the table.} It's a bad night, and a wild
night, Micheal Dara, and isn't it a great while I am at the foot of the
back hills, sitting up here boiling food for himself, and food for the
brood sow, and baking a cake when the night falls? {She puts up the
money, listlessly, in little piles on the table.} Isn't it a long while
I am sitting here in the winter and the summer, and the fine spring,
with the young growing behind me and the old passing, saying to myself
one time, to look on Mary Brien who wasn't that height {holding out
her hand}, and I a fine girl growing up, and there she is now with
two children, and another coming on her in three months or four. {She
pauses.}

MICHEAL {Moving over three of the piles.} That's three pounds we have
now, Nora Burke.

NORA {Continuing in the same voice.} And saying to myself another time,
to look on Peggy Cavanagh, who had the lightest hand at milking a cow
that wouldn't be easy, or turning a cake, and there she is now walking
round on the roads, or sitting in a dirty old house, with no teeth in
her mouth, and no sense and no more hair than you'ld see on a bit of a
hill and they after burning the furze from it.

MICHEAL That's five pounds and ten notes, a good sum, surely!... It's
not that way you'll be talking when you marry a young man, Nora Burke,
and they were saying in the fair my lambs were the best lambs, and I got
a grand price, for I'm no fool now at making a bargain when my lambs are
good.

NORA What was it you got?

MICHEAL Twenty pound for the lot, Nora Burke.... We'ld do right to wait
now till himself will be quiet awhile in the Seven Churches, and then
you'll marry me in the chapel of Rathvanna, and I'll bring the sheep up
on the bit of a hill you have on the back mountain, and we won't have
anything we'ld be afeard to let our minds on when the mist is down.

NORA {Pouring him out some whisky.} Why would I marry you, Mike Dara?
You'll be getting old and I'll be getting old, and in a little while
I'm telling you, you'll be sitting up in your bed--the way himself was
sitting--with a shake in your face, and your teeth falling, and the
white hair sticking out round you like an old bush where sheep do be
leaping a gap.

{Dan Burke sits up noiselessly from under the sheet, with his hand to
his face. His white hair is sticking out round his head.}

NORA {Goes on slowly without hearing him.} It's a pitiful thing to be
getting old, but it's a queer thing surely. It's a queer thing to see
an old man sitting up there in his bed with no teeth in him, and a rough
word in his mouth, and his chin the way it would take the bark from the
edge of an oak board you'ld have building a door.... God forgive me,
Micheal Dara, we'll all be getting old, but it's a queer thing surely.

MICHEAL It's too lonesome you are from living a long time with an old
man, Nora, and you're talking again like a herd that would be coming
down from the thick mist {he puts his arm round her}, but it's a fine
life you'll have now with a young man, a fine life surely....

{Dan sneezes violently. Micheal tries to get to the door, but before
he can do so, Dan jumps out of the bed in queer white clothes, with his
stick in his hand, and goes over and puts his back against it.}

MICHEAL Son of God deliver us.

{Crosses himself, and goes backward across the room.}

DAN {Holding up his hand at him.} Now you'll not marry her the time I'm
rotting below in the Seven Churches, and you'll see the thing I'll give
you will follow you on the back mountains when the wind is high.

MICHEAL {To Nora.} Get me out of it, Nora, for the love of God. He
always did what you bid him, and I'm thinking he would do it now.

NORA {Looking at the Tramp.} Is it dead he is or living?

DAN {Turning towards her.} It's little you care if it's dead or living I
am, but there'll be an end now of your fine times, and all the talk you
have of young men and old men, and of the mist coming up or going down.
{He opens the door.} You'll walk out now from that door, Nora Burke,
and it's not to-morrow, or the next day, or any day of your life, that
you'll put in your foot through it again.

TRAMP {Standing up.} It's a hard thing you're saying for an old man,
master of the house, and what would the like of her do if you put her
out on the roads?

DAN Let her walk round the like of Peggy Cavanagh below, and be begging
money at the cross-road, or selling songs to the men. {To Nora.} Walk
out now, Nora Burke, and it's soon you'll be getting old with that life,
I'm telling you; it's soon your teeth'll be falling and your head'll be
the like of a bush where sheep do be leaping a gap.

{He pauses: she looks round at Micheal.}

MICHEAL {Timidly.} There's a fine Union below in Rathdrum.

DAN The like of her would never go there.... It's lonesome roads she'll
be going and hiding herself away till the end will come, and they
find her stretched like a dead sheep with the frost on her, or the big
spiders, maybe, and they putting their webs on her, in the butt of a
ditch.

NORA {Angrily.} What way will yourself be that day, Daniel Burke? What
way will you be that day and you lying down a long while in your grave?
For it's bad you are living, and it's bad you'll be when you're dead.
{She looks at him a moment fiercely, then half turns away and speaks
plaintively again.} Yet, if it is itself, Daniel Burke, who can help it
at all, and let you be getting up into your bed, and not be taking your
death with the wind blowing on you, and the rain with it, and you half
in your skin.

DAN It's proud and happy you'ld be if I was getting my death the day I
was shut of yourself. {Pointing to the door.} Let you walk out through
that door, I'm telling you, and let you not be passing this way if it's
hungry you are, or wanting a bed.

TRAMP {Pointing to Micheal.} Maybe himself would take her.

NORA What would he do with me now?

TRAMP Give you the half of a dry bed, and good food in your mouth.

DAN Is it a fool you think him, stranger, or is it a fool you were born
yourself? Let her walk out of that door, and let you go along with
her, stranger--if it's raining itself--for it's too much talk you have
surely.

TRAMP {Going over to Nora.} We'll be going now, lady of the house--the
rain is falling, but the air is kind and maybe it'll be a grand morning
by the grace of God.

NORA What good is a grand morning when I'm destroyed surely, and I going
out to get my death walking the roads?

TRAMP You'll not be getting your death with myself, lady of the house,
and I knowing all the ways a man can put food in his mouth.... We'll be
going now, I'm telling you, and the time you'll be feeling the cold,
and the frost, and the great rain, and the sun again, and the south wind
blowing in the glens, you'll not be sitting up on a wet ditch, the way
you're after sitting in the place, making yourself old with looking
on each day, and it passing you by. You'll be saying one time, "It's
a grand evening, by the grace of God," and another time, "It's a wild
night, God help us, but it'll pass surely." You'll be saying--

DAN {Goes over to them crying out impatiently.} Go out of that door, I'm
telling you, and do your blathering below in the glen.

{Nora gathers a few things into her shawl.}

TRAMP {At the door.} Come along with me now, lady of the house, and it's
not my blather you'll be hearing only, but you'll be hearing the herons
crying out over the black lakes, and you'll be hearing the grouse and
the owls with them, and the larks and the big thrushes when the days
are warm, and it's not from the like of them you'll be hearing a talk
of getting old like Peggy Cavanagh, and losing the hair off you, and the
light of your eyes, but it's fine songs you'll be hearing when the sun
goes up, and there'll be no old fellow wheezing, the like of a sick
sheep, close to your ear.

NORA I'm thinking it's myself will be wheezing that time with lying down
under the Heavens when the night is cold; but you've a fine bit of talk,
stranger, and it's with yourself I'll go.

{She goes towards the door, then turns to Dan.} You think it's a grand
thing you're after doing with your letting on to be dead, but what is it
at all? What way would a woman live in a lonesome place the like of this
place, and she not making a talk with the men passing? And what way
will yourself live from this day, with none to care for you? What is it
you'll have now but a black life, Daniel Burke, and it's not long I'm
telling you, till you'll be lying again under that sheet, and you dead
surely.

{She goes out with the Tramp. Micheal is slinking after them, but Dan
stops him.}

DAN Sit down now and take a little taste of the stuff, Micheal Dara.
There's a great drouth on me, and the night is young.

MICHEAL {Coming back to the table.} And it's very dry I am, surely, with
the fear of death you put on me, and I after driving mountain ewes since
the turn of the day.

DAN {Throwing away his stick.} I was thinking to strike you, Micheal
Dara, but you're a quiet man, God help you, and I don't mind you at all.

{He pours out two glasses of whisky, and gives one to Micheal.}

DAN Your good health, Micheal Dara.

MICHEAL God reward you, Daniel Burke, and may you have a long life, and
a quiet life, and good health with it. {They drink.}

following day.




THE PLAYBOY OF THE WESTERN WORLD




ACT I.


SCENE: [Country public-house or shebeen, very rough and untidy. There
is a sort of counter on the right with shelves, holding many bottles and
jugs, just seen above it. Empty barrels stand near the counter. At back,
a little to left of counter, there is a door into the open air, then,
more to the left, there is a settle with shelves above it, with more
jugs, and a table beneath a window. At the left there is a large open
fire-place, with turf fire, and a small door into inner room. Pegeen, a
wild looking but fine girl, of about twenty, is writing at table. She is
dressed in the usual peasant dress.]

PEGEEN -- [slowly as she writes.] -- Six yards of stuff for to make a
yellow gown. A pair of lace boots with lengthy heels on them and brassy
eyes. A hat is suited for a wedding-day. A fine tooth comb. To be
sent with three barrels of porter in Jimmy Farrell's creel cart on the
evening of the coming Fair to Mister Michael James Flaherty. With the
best compliments of this season. Margaret Flaherty.

SHAWN KEOGH -- [a fat and fair young man comes in as she signs, looks
round awkwardly, when he sees she is alone.] -- Where's himself?

PEGEEN -- [without looking at him.] -- He's coming. (She directs the
letter.) To Mister Sheamus Mulroy, Wine and Spirit Dealer, Castlebar.

SHAWN -- [uneasily.] -- I didn't see him on the road.

PEGEEN. How would you see him (licks stamp and puts it on letter) and it
dark night this half hour gone by?

SHAWN -- [turning towards the door again.] -- I stood a while outside
wondering would I have a right to pass on or to walk in and see you,
Pegeen Mike (comes to fire), and I could hear the cows breathing, and
sighing in the stillness of the air, and not a step moving any place
from this gate to the bridge.

PEGEEN -- [putting letter in envelope.] -- It's above at the cross-roads
he is, meeting Philly Cullen; and a couple more are going along with him
to Kate Cassidy's wake.

SHAWN -- [looking at her blankly.] -- And he's going that length in the
dark night?

PEGEEN -- [impatiently.] He is surely, and leaving me lonesome on the
scruff of the hill. (She gets up and puts envelope on dresser, then
winds clock.) Isn't it long the nights are now, Shawn Keogh, to be
leaving a poor girl with her own self counting the hours to the dawn of
day?

SHAWN -- [with awkward humour.] -- If it is, when we're wedded in a
short while you'll have no call to complain, for I've little will to be
walking off to wakes or weddings in the darkness of the night.

PEGEEN -- [with rather scornful good humour.] -- You're making mighty
certain, Shaneen, that I'll wed you now.

SHAWN. Aren't we after making a good bargain, the way we're only waiting
these days on Father Reilly's dispensation from the bishops, or the
Court of Rome.

PEGEEN -- [looking at him teasingly, washing up at dresser.] -- It's a
wonder, Shaneen, the Holy Father'd be taking notice of the likes of you;
for if I was him I wouldn't bother with this place where you'll meet
none but Red Linahan, has a squint in his eye, and Patcheen is lame in
his heel, or the mad Mulrannies were driven from California and they
lost in their wits. We're a queer lot these times to go troubling the
Holy Father on his sacred seat.

SHAWN -- [scandalized.] If we are, we're as good this place as another,
maybe, and as good these times as we were for ever.

PEGEEN -- [with scorn.] -- As good, is it? Where now will you meet the
like of Daneen Sullivan knocked the eye from a peeler, or Marcus Quin,
God rest him, got six months for maiming ewes, and he a great warrant to
tell stories of holy Ireland till he'd have the old women shedding
down tears about their feet. Where will you find the like of them, I'm
saying?

SHAWN -- [timidly.] If you don't it's a good job, maybe; for (with
peculiar emphasis on the words) Father Reilly has small conceit to have
that kind walking around and talking to the girls.

PEGEEN -- [impatiently, throwing water from basin out of the door.] --
Stop tormenting me with Father Reilly (imitating his voice) when I'm
asking only what way I'll pass these twelve hours of dark, and not take
my death with the fear. [Looking out of door.]

SHAWN -- [timidly.] Would I fetch you the widow Quin, maybe?

PEGEEN. Is it the like of that murderer? You'll not, surely.

SHAWN -- [going to her, soothingly.] -- Then I'm thinking himself will
stop along with you when he sees you taking on, for it'll be a long
night-time with great darkness, and I'm after feeling a kind of fellow
above in the furzy ditch, groaning wicked like a maddening dog, the way
it's good cause you have, maybe, to be fearing now.

PEGEEN -- [turning on him sharply.] -- What's that? Is it a man you
seen?

SHAWN -- [retreating.] I couldn't see him at all; but I heard him
groaning out, and breaking his heart. It should have been a young man
from his words speaking.

PEGEEN -- [going after him.] -- And you never went near to see was he
hurted or what ailed him at all?

SHAWN. I did not, Pegeen Mike. It was a dark, lonesome place to be
hearing the like of him.

PEGEEN. Well, you're a daring fellow, and if they find his corpse
stretched above in the dews of dawn, what'll you say then to the
peelers, or the Justice of the Peace?

SHAWN -- [thunderstruck.] I wasn't thinking of that. For the love of
God, Pegeen Mike, don't let on I was speaking of him. Don't tell your
father and the men is coming above; for if they heard that story, they'd
have great blabbing this night at the wake.

PEGEEN. I'll maybe tell them, and I'll maybe not.

SHAWN. They are coming at the door, Will you whisht, I'm saying?

PEGEEN. Whisht yourself.

[She goes behind counter. Michael James, fat jovial publican, comes
in followed by Philly Cullen, who is thin and mistrusting, and Jimmy
Farrell, who is fat and amorous, about forty-five.]

MEN -- [together.] -- God bless you. The blessing of God on this place.

PEGEEN. God bless you kindly.

MICHAEL -- [to men who go to the counter.] -- Sit down now, and take
your rest. (Crosses to Shawn at the fire.) And how is it you are, Shawn
Keogh? Are you coming over the sands to Kate Cassidy's wake?

SHAWN. I am not, Michael James. I'm going home the short cut to my bed.

PEGEEN -- [speaking across the counter.] -- He's right too, and have
you no shame, Michael James, to be quitting off for the whole night, and
leaving myself lonesome in the shop?

MICHAEL -- [good-humouredly.] Isn't it the same whether I go for the
whole night or a part only? and I'm thinking it's a queer daughter you
are if you'd have me crossing backward through the Stooks of the Dead
Women, with a drop taken.

PEGEEN. If I am a queer daughter, it's a queer father'd be leaving me
lonesome these twelve hours of dark, and I piling the turf with the dogs
barking, and the calves mooing, and my own teeth rattling with the fear.

JIMMY -- [flatteringly.] -- What is there to hurt you, and you a fine,
hardy girl would knock the head of any two men in the place?

PEGEEN -- [working herself up.] -- Isn't there the harvest boys with
their tongues red for drink, and the ten tinkers is camped in the east
glen, and the thousand militia -- bad cess to them! -- walking idle
through the land. There's lots surely to hurt me, and I won't stop alone
in it, let himself do what he will.

MICHAEL. If you're that afeard, let Shawn Keogh stop along with you.
It's the will of God, I'm thinking, himself should be seeing to you now.
[They all turn on Shawn.]

SHAWN -- [in horrified confusion.] -- I would and welcome, Michael
James, but I'm afeard of Father Reilly; and what at all would the Holy
Father and the Cardinals of Rome be saying if they heard I did the like
of that?

MICHAEL -- [with contempt.] -- God help you! Can't you sit in by the
hearth with the light lit and herself beyond in the room? You'll do that
surely, for I've heard tell there's a queer fellow above, going mad or
getting his death, maybe, in the gripe of the ditch, so she'd be safer
this night with a person here.

SHAWN -- [with plaintive despair.] -- I'm afeard of Father Reilly, I'm
saying. Let you not be tempting me, and we near married itself.

PHILLY -- [with cold contempt.] -- Lock him in the west room. He'll stay
then and have no sin to be telling to the priest.

MICHAEL -- [to Shawn, getting between him and the door.] -- Go up now.

SHAWN -- [at the top of his voice.] -- Don't stop me, Michael James. Let
me out of the door, I'm saying, for the love of the Almighty God. Let me
out (trying to dodge past him). Let me out of it, and may God grant you
His indulgence in the hour of need.

MICHAEL -- [loudly.] Stop your noising, and sit down by the hearth.
[Gives him a push and goes to counter laughing.]

SHAWN -- [turning back, wringing his hands.] -- Oh, Father Reilly and
the saints of God, where will I hide myself to-day? Oh, St. Joseph and
St. Patrick and St. Brigid, and St. James, have mercy on me now! [Shawn
turns round, sees door clear, and makes a rush for it.]

MICHAEL -- [catching him by the coattail.] -- You'd be going, is it?

SHAWN -- [screaming.] Leave me go, Michael James, leave me go, you old
Pagan, leave me go, or I'll get the curse of the priests on you, and
of the scarlet-coated bishops of the courts of Rome. [With a sudden
movement he pulls himself out of his coat, and disappears out of the
door, leaving his coat in Michael's hands.]

MICHAEL -- [turning round, and holding up coat.] -- Well, there's the
coat of a Christian man. Oh, there's sainted glory this day in the
lonesome west; and by the will of God I've got you a decent man, Pegeen,
you'll have no call to be spying after if you've a score of young girls,
maybe, weeding in your fields.

PEGEEN [taking up the defence of her property.] -- What right have you
to be making game of a poor fellow for minding the priest, when it's
your own the fault is, not paying a penny pot-boy to stand along with
me and give me courage in the doing of my work? [She snaps the coat away
from him, and goes behind counter with it.]

MICHAEL -- [taken aback.] -- Where would I get a pot-boy? Would you have
me send the bell-man screaming in the streets of Castlebar?

SHAWN -- [opening the door a chink and putting in his head, in a small
voice.] -- Michael James!

MICHAEL -- [imitating him.] -- What ails you?

SHAWN. The queer dying fellow's beyond looking over the ditch. He's come
up, I'm thinking, stealing your hens. (Looks over his shoulder.) God
help me, he's following me now (he runs into room), and if he's heard
what I said, he'll be having my life, and I going home lonesome in the
darkness of the night. [For a perceptible moment they watch the door
with curiosity. Some one coughs outside. Then Christy Mahon, a slight
young man, comes in very tired and frightened and dirty.]

CHRISTY -- [in a small voice.] -- God save all here!

MEN. God save you kindly.

CHRISTY -- [going to the counter.] -- I'd trouble you for a glass of
porter, woman of the house. [He puts down coin.]

PEGEEN -- [serving him.] -- You're one of the tinkers, young fellow, is
beyond camped in the glen?

CHRISTY. I am not; but I'm destroyed walking.

MICHAEL -- [patronizingly.] Let you come up then to the fire. You're
looking famished with the cold.

CHRISTY. God reward you. (He takes up his glass and goes a little way
across to the left, then stops and looks about him.) Is it often the
police do be coming into this place, master of the house?

MICHAEL. If you'd come in better hours, you'd have seen "Licensed for
the sale of Beer and Spirits, to be consumed on the premises," written
in white letters above the door, and what would the polis want spying
on me, and not a decent house within four miles, the way every living
Christian is a bona fide, saving one widow alone?

CHRISTY -- [with relief.] -- It's a safe house, so. [He goes over to the
fire, sighing and moaning. Then he sits down, putting his glass beside
him and begins gnawing a turnip, too miserable to feel the others
staring at him with curiosity.]

MICHAEL -- [going after him.] -- Is it yourself fearing the polis?
You're wanting, maybe?

CHRISTY. There's many wanting.

MICHAEL. Many surely, with the broken harvest and the ended wars. (He
picks up some stockings, etc., that are near the fire, and carries them
away furtively.) It should be larceny, I'm thinking?

CHRISTY -- [dolefully.] I had it in my mind it was a different word and
a bigger.

PEGEEN. There's a queer lad. Were you never slapped in school, young
fellow, that you don't know the name of your deed?

CHRISTY -- [bashfully.] I'm slow at learning, a middling scholar only.

MICHAEL. If you're a dunce itself, you'd have a right to know that
larceny's robbing and stealing. Is it for the like of that you're
wanting?

CHRISTY -- [with a flash of family pride.] -- And I the son of a strong
farmer (with a sudden qualm), God rest his soul, could have bought
up the whole of your old house a while since, from the butt of his
tailpocket, and not have missed the weight of it gone.

MICHAEL -- [impressed.] If it's not stealing, it's maybe something big.

CHRISTY -- [flattered.] Aye; it's maybe something big.

JIMMY. He's a wicked-looking young fellow. Maybe he followed after a
young woman on a lonesome night.

CHRISTY -- [shocked.] Oh, the saints forbid, mister; I was all times a
decent lad.

PHILLY -- [turning on Jimmy.] -- You're a silly man, Jimmy Farrell. He
said his father was a farmer a while since, and there's himself now in
a poor state. Maybe the land was grabbed from him, and he did what any
decent man would do.

MICHAEL -- [to Christy, mysteriously.] -- Was it bailiffs?

CHRISTY. The divil a one.

MICHAEL. Agents?

CHRISTY. The divil a one.

MICHAEL. Landlords?

CHRISTY -- [peevishly.] Ah, not at all, I'm saying. You'd see the like
of them stories on any little paper of a Munster town. But I'm not
calling to mind any person, gentle, simple, judge or jury, did the like
of me. [They all draw nearer with delighted curiosity.]

PHILLY. Well, that lad's a puzzle--the world.

JIMMY. He'd beat Dan Davies' circus, or the holy missioners making
sermons on the villainy of man. Try him again, Philly.

PHILLY. Did you strike golden guineas out of solder, young fellow, or
shilling coins itself?

CHRISTY. I did not, mister, not sixpence nor a farthing coin.

JIMMY. Did you marry three wives maybe? I'm told there's a sprinkling
have done that among the holy Luthers of the preaching north.

CHRISTY -- [shyly.] -- I never married with one, let alone with a couple
or three.

PHILLY. Maybe he went fighting for the Boers, the like of the man
beyond, was judged to be hanged, quartered and drawn. Were you off east,
young fellow, fighting bloody wars for Kruger and the freedom of the
Boers?

CHRISTY. I never left my own parish till Tuesday was a week.

PEGEEN -- [coming from counter.] -- He's done nothing, so. (To Christy.)
If you didn't commit murder or a bad, nasty thing, or false coining,
or robbery, or butchery, or the like of them, there isn't anything that
would be worth your troubling for to run from now. You did nothing at
all.

CHRISTY -- [his feelings hurt.] -- That's an unkindly thing to be saying
to a poor orphaned traveller, has a prison behind him, and hanging
before, and hell's gap gaping below.

PEGEEN [with a sign to the men to be quiet.] -- You're only saying it.
You did nothing at all. A soft lad the like of you wouldn't slit the
windpipe of a screeching sow.

CHRISTY -- [offended.] You're not speaking the truth.

PEGEEN -- [in mock rage.] -- Not speaking the truth, is it? Would you
have me knock the head of you with the butt of the broom?

CHRISTY -- [twisting round on her with a sharp cry of horror.] -- Don't
strike me. I killed my poor father, Tuesday was a week, for doing the
like of that.

PEGEEN [with blank amazement.] -- Is it killed your father?

CHRISTY -- [subsiding.] With the help of God I did surely, and that the
Holy Immaculate Mother may intercede for his soul.

PHILLY -- [retreating with Jimmy.] -- There's a daring fellow.

JIMMY. Oh, glory be to God!

MICHAEL -- [with great respect.] -- That was a hanging crime, mister
honey. You should have had good reason for doing the like of that.

CHRISTY -- [in a very reasonable tone.] -- He was a dirty man, God
forgive him, and he getting old and crusty, the way I couldn't put up
with him at all.

PEGEEN. And you shot him dead?

CHRISTY -- [shaking his head.] -- I never used weapons. I've no license,
and I'm a law-fearing man.

MICHAEL. It was with a hilted knife maybe? I'm told, in the big world
it's bloody knives they use.

CHRISTY -- [loudly, scandalized.] -- Do you take me for a slaughter-boy?

PEGEEN. You never hanged him, the way Jimmy Farrell hanged his dog from
the license, and had it screeching and wriggling three hours at the butt
of a string, and himself swearing it was a dead dog, and the peelers
swearing it had life?

CHRISTY. I did not then. I just riz the loy and let fall the edge of
it on the ridge of his skull, and he went down at my feet like an empty
sack, and never let a grunt or groan from him at all.

MICHAEL -- [making a sign to Pegeen to fill Christy's glass.] -- And
what way weren't you hanged, mister? Did you bury him then?

CHRISTY -- [considering.] Aye. I buried him then. Wasn't I digging spuds
in the field?

MICHAEL. And the peelers never followed after you the eleven days that
you're out?

CHRISTY -- [shaking his head.] -- Never a one of them, and I walking
forward facing hog, dog, or divil on the highway of the road.

PHILLY -- [nodding wisely.] -- It's only with a common week-day kind
of a murderer them lads would be trusting their carcase, and that man
should be a great terror when his temper's roused.

MICHAEL. He should then. (To Christy.) And where was it, mister honey,
that you did the deed?

CHRISTY -- [looking at him with suspicion.] -- Oh, a distant place,
master of the house, a windy corner of high, distant hills.

PHILLY -- [nodding with approval.] -- He's a close man, and he's right,
surely.

PEGEEN. That'd be a lad with the sense of Solomon to have for a pot-boy,
Michael James, if it's the truth you're seeking one at all.

PHILLY. The peelers is fearing him, and if you'd that lad in the house
there isn't one of them would come smelling around if the dogs itself
were lapping poteen from the dungpit of the yard.

JIMMY. Bravery's a treasure in a lonesome place, and a lad would kill
his father, I'm thinking, would face a foxy divil with a pitchpike on
the flags of hell.

PEGEEN. It's the truth they're saying, and if I'd that lad in the house,
I wouldn't be fearing the loosed kharki cut-throats, or the walking
dead.

CHRISTY -- [swelling with surprise and triumph.] -- Well, glory be to
God!

MICHAEL -- [with deference.] -- Would you think well to stop here and be
pot-boy, mister honey, if we gave you good wages, and didn't destroy you
with the weight of work?

SHAWN -- [coming forward uneasily.] -- That'd be a queer kind to bring
into a decent quiet household with the like of Pegeen Mike.

PEGEEN -- [very sharply.] -- Will you whisht? Who's speaking to you?

SHAWN -- [retreating.] A bloody-handed murderer the like of...

PEGEEN -- [snapping at him.] -- Whisht I am saying; we'll take no
fooling from your like at all. (To Christy with a honeyed voice.) And
you, young fellow, you'd have a right to stop, I'm thinking, for we'd do
our all and utmost to content your needs.

CHRISTY -- [overcome with wonder.] -- And I'd be safe in this place from
the searching law?

MICHAEL. You would, surely. If they're not fearing you, itself, the
peelers in this place is decent droughty poor fellows, wouldn't touch a
cur dog and not give warning in the dead of night.

PEGEEN -- [very kindly and persuasively.] -- Let you stop a short
while anyhow. Aren't you destroyed walking with your feet in bleeding
blisters, and your whole skin needing washing like a Wicklow sheep.

CHRISTY -- [looking round with satisfaction.] It's a nice room, and if
it's not humbugging me you are, I'm thinking that I'll surely stay.

JIMMY -- [jumps up.] -- Now, by the grace of God, herself will be safe
this night, with a man killed his father holding danger from the door,
and let you come on, Michael James, or they'll have the best stuff drunk
at the wake.

MICHAEL -- [going to the door with men.] And begging your pardon,
mister, what name will we call you, for we'd like to know?

CHRISTY. Christopher Mahon.

MICHAEL. Well, God bless you, Christy, and a good rest till we meet
again when the sun'll be rising to the noon of day.

CHRISTY. God bless you all.

MEN. God bless you. [They go out except Shawn, who lingers at door.]

SHAWN -- [to Pegeen.] -- Are you wanting me to stop along with you and
keep you from harm?

PEGEEN -- [gruffly.] Didn't you say you were fearing Father Reilly?

SHAWN. There'd be no harm staying now, I'm thinking, and himself in it
too.

PEGEEN. You wouldn't stay when there was need for you, and let you step
off nimble this time when there's none.

SHAWN. Didn't I say it was Father Reilly...

PEGEEN. Go on, then, to Father Reilly (in a jeering tone), and let him
put you in the holy brotherhoods, and leave that lad to me.

SHAWN. If I meet the Widow Quin...

PEGEEN. Go on, I'm saying, and don't be waking this place with your
noise. (She hustles him out and bolts the door.) That lad would wear
the spirits from the saints of peace. (Bustles about, then takes off
her apron and pins it up in the window as a blind. Christy watching her
timidly. Then she comes to him and speaks with bland good-humour.) Let
you stretch out now by the fire, young fellow. You should be destroyed
travelling.

CHRISTY -- [shyly again, drawing off his boots.] I'm tired, surely,
walking wild eleven days, and waking fearful in the night. [He holds
up one of his feet, feeling his blisters, and looking at them with
compassion.]

PEGEEN -- [standing beside him, watching him with delight.] -- You
should have had great people in your family, I'm thinking, with the
little, small feet you have, and you with a kind of a quality name, the
like of what you'd find on the great powers and potentates of France and
Spain.

CHRISTY -- [with pride.] -- We were great surely, with wide and windy
acres of rich Munster land.

PEGEEN. Wasn't I telling you, and you a fine, handsome young fellow with
a noble brow?

CHRISTY -- [with a flash of delighted surprise.] Is it me?

PEGEEN. Aye. Did you never hear that from the young girls where you come
from in the west or south?

CHRISTY -- [with venom.] -- I did not then. Oh, they're bloody liars in
the naked parish where I grew a man.

PEGEEN. If they are itself, you've heard it these days, I'm thinking,
and you walking the world telling out your story to young girls or old.

CHRISTY. I've told my story no place till this night, Pegeen Mike, and
it's foolish I was here, maybe, to be talking free, but you're decent
people, I'm thinking, and yourself a kindly woman, the way I wasn't
fearing you at all.

PEGEEN -- [filling a sack with straw.] -- You've said the like of that,
maybe, in every cot and cabin where you've met a young girl on your way.

CHRISTY -- [going over to her, gradually raising his voice.] -- I've
said it nowhere till this night, I'm telling you, for I've seen none the
like of you the eleven long days I am walking the world, looking over a
low ditch or a high ditch on my north or my south, into stony scattered
fields, or scribes of bog, where you'd see young, limber girls, and fine
prancing women making laughter with the men.

PEGEEN. If you weren't destroyed travelling, you'd have as much talk
and streeleen, I'm thinking, as Owen Roe O'Sullivan or the poets of the
Dingle Bay, and I've heard all times it's the poets are your like, fine
fiery fellows with great rages when their temper's roused.

CHRISTY -- [drawing a little nearer to her.] -- You've a power of rings,
God bless you, and would there be any offence if I was asking are you
single now?

PEGEEN. What would I want wedding so young?

CHRISTY -- [with relief.] -- We're alike, so.

PEGEEN -- [she puts sack on settle and beats it up.] -- I never killed
my father. I'd be afeard to do that, except I was the like of yourself
with blind rages tearing me within, for I'm thinking you should have had
great tussling when the end was come.

CHRISTY -- [expanding with delight at the first confidential talk he has
ever had with a woman.] -- We had not then. It was a hard woman was come
over the hill, and if he was always a crusty kind when he'd a hard woman
setting him on, not the divil himself or his four fathers could put up
with him at all.

PEGEEN -- [with curiosity.] -- And isn't it a great wonder that one
wasn't fearing you?

CHRISTY -- [very confidentially.] -- Up to the day I killed my father,
there wasn't a person in Ireland knew the kind I was, and I there
drinking, waking, eating, sleeping, a quiet, simple poor fellow with no
man giving me heed.

PEGEEN -- [getting a quilt out of the cupboard and putting it on the
sack.] -- It was the girls were giving you heed maybe, and I'm thinking
it's most conceit you'd have to be gaming with their like.

CHRISTY -- [shaking his head, with simplicity.] Not the girls itself,
and I won't tell you a lie. There wasn't anyone heeding me in that place
saving only the dumb beasts of the field. [He sits down at fire.]

PEGEEN -- [with disappointment.] -- And I thinking you should have been
living the like of a king of Norway or the Eastern world. [She comes and
sits beside him after placing bread and mug of milk on the table.]

CHRISTY -- [laughing piteously.] -- The like of a king, is it? And I
after toiling, moiling, digging, dodging from the dawn till dusk with
never a sight of joy or sport saving only when I'd be abroad in the dark
night poaching rabbits on hills, for I was a devil to poach, God forgive
me, (very naively) and I near got six months for going with a dung fork
and stabbing a fish.

PEGEEN. And it's that you'd call sport, is it, to be abroad in the
darkness with yourself alone?

CHRISTY. I did, God help me, and there I'd be as happy as the sunshine
of St. Martin's Day, watching the light passing the north or the patches
of fog, till I'd hear a rabbit starting to screech and I'd go running in
the furze. Then when I'd my full share I'd come walking down where you'd
see the ducks and geese stretched sleeping on the highway of the road,
and before I'd pass the dunghill, I'd hear himself snoring out, a loud
lonesome snore he'd be making all times, the while he was sleeping, and
he a man 'd be raging all times, the while he was waking, like a gaudy
officer you'd hear cursing and damning and swearing oaths.

PEGEEN. Providence and Mercy, spare us all!

CHRISTY. It's that you'd say surely if you seen him and he after
drinking for weeks, rising up in the red dawn, or before it maybe, and
going out into the yard as naked as an ash tree in the moon of May, and
shying clods against the visage of the stars till he'd put the fear of
death into the banbhs and the screeching sows.

PEGEEN. I'd be well-night afeard of that lad myself, I'm thinking. And
there was no one in it but the two of you alone?

CHRISTY. The divil a one, though he'd sons and daughters walking all
great states and territories of the world, and not a one of them, to
this day, but would say their seven curses on him, and they rousing up
to let a cough or sneeze, maybe, in the deadness of the night.

PEGEEN [nodding her head.] -- Well, you should have been a queer lot.
I never cursed my father the like of that, though I'm twenty and more
years of age.

CHRISTY. Then you'd have cursed mine, I'm telling you, and he a man
never gave peace to any, saving when he'd get two months or three, or
be locked in the asylums for battering peelers or assaulting men (with
depression) the way it was a bitter life he led me till I did up a
Tuesday and halve his skull.

PEGEEN -- [putting her hand on his shoulder.] -- Well, you'll have peace
in this place, Christy Mahon, and none to trouble you, and it's near
time a fine lad like you should have your good share of the earth.

CHRISTY. It's time surely, and I a seemly fellow with great strength in
me and bravery of... [Someone knocks.]

CHRISTY -- [clinging to Pegeen.] -- Oh, glory! it's late for knocking,
and this last while I'm in terror of the peelers, and the walking dead.
[Knocking again.]

PEGEEN. Who's there?

VOICE -- [outside.] Me.

PEGEEN. Who's me?

VOICE. The Widow Quin.

PEGEEN [jumping up and giving him the bread and milk.] -- Go on now with
your supper, and let on to be sleepy, for if she found you were such
a warrant to talk, she'd be stringing gabble till the dawn of day. (He
takes bread and sits shyly with his back to the door.)

PEGEEN [opening door, with temper.] -- What ails you, or what is it
you're wanting at this hour of the night?

WIDOW QUIN -- [coming in a step and peering at Christy.] -- I'm after
meeting Shawn Keogh and Father Reilly below, who told me of your
curiosity man, and they fearing by this time he was maybe roaring,
romping on your hands with drink.

PEGEEN [pointing to Christy.] -- Look now is he roaring, and he
stretched away drowsy with his supper and his mug of milk. Walk down and
tell that to Father Reilly and to Shaneen Keogh.

WIDOW QUIN -- [coming forward.] -- I'll not see them again, for I've
their word to lead that lad forward for to lodge with me.

PEGEEN -- [in blank amazement.] -- This night, is it?

WIDOW QUIN -- [going over.] -- This night. "It isn't fitting," says the
priesteen, "to have his likeness lodging with an orphaned girl." (To
Christy.) God save you, mister!

CHRISTY -- [shyly.] -- God save you kindly.

WIDOW QUIN -- [looking at him with half-amazed curiosity.] -- Well,
aren't you a little smiling fellow? It should have been great and bitter
torments did rouse your spirits to a deed of blood.

CHRISTY -- [doubtfully.] It should, maybe.

WIDOW QUIN. It's more than "maybe" I'm saying, and it'd soften my heart
to see you sitting so simple with your cup and cake, and you fitter to
be saying your catechism than slaying your da.

PEGEEN -- [at counter, washing glasses.] -- There's talking when any'd
see he's fit to be holding his head high with the wonders of the world.
Walk on from this, for I'll not have him tormented and he destroyed
travelling since Tuesday was a week.

WIDOW QUIN -- [peaceably.] We'll be walking surely when his supper's
done, and you'll find we're great company, young fellow, when it's of
the like of you and me you'd hear the penny poets singing in an August
Fair.

CHRISTY -- [innocently.] Did you kill your father?

PEGEEN -- [contemptuously.] She did not. She hit himself with a worn
pick, and the rusted poison did corrode his blood the way he never
overed it, and died after. That was a sneaky kind of murder did win
small glory with the boys itself. [She crosses to Christy's left.]

WIDOW QUIN -- [with good-humour.] -- If it didn't, maybe all knows a
widow woman has buried her children and destroyed her man is a
wiser comrade for a young lad than a girl, the like of you, who'd go
helter-skeltering after any man would let you a wink upon the road.

PEGEEN -- [breaking out into wild rage.] -- And you'll say that, Widow
Quin, and you gasping with the rage you had racing the hill beyond to
look on his face.

WIDOW QUIN -- [laughing derisively.] -- Me, is it? Well, Father Reilly
has cuteness to divide you now. (She pulls Christy up.) There's great
temptation in a man did slay his da, and we'd best be going, young
fellow; so rise up and come with me.

PEGEEN -- [seizing his arm.] -- He'll not stir. He's pot-boy in this
place, and I'll not have him stolen off and kidnabbed while himself's
abroad.

WIDOW QUIN. It'd be a crazy pot-boy'd lodge him in the shebeen where he
works by day, so you'd have a right to come on, young fellow, till you
see my little houseen, a perch off on the rising hill.

PEGEEN. Wait till morning, Christy Mahon. Wait till you lay eyes on her
leaky thatch is growing more pasture for her buck goat than her square
of fields, and she without a tramp itself to keep in order her place at
all.

WIDOW QUIN. When you see me contriving in my little gardens, Christy
Mahon, you'll swear the Lord God formed me to be living lone, and that
there isn't my match in Mayo for thatching, or mowing, or shearing a
sheep.

PEGEEN -- [with noisy scorn.] -- It's true the Lord God formed you to
contrive indeed. Doesn't the world know you reared a black lamb at your
own breast, so that the Lord Bishop of Connaught felt the elements of
a Christian, and he eating it after in a kidney stew? Doesn't the
world know you've been seen shaving the foxy skipper from France for a
threepenny bit and a sop of grass tobacco would wring the liver from a
mountain goat you'd meet leaping the hills?

WIDOW QUIN -- [with amusement.] -- Do you hear her now, young fellow? Do
you hear the way she'll be rating at your own self when a week is by?

PEGEEN -- [to Christy.] -- Don't heed her. Tell her to go into her
pigsty and not plague us here.

WIDOW QUIN. I'm going; but he'll come with me.

PEGEEN -- [shaking him.] -- Are you dumb, young fellow?

CHRISTY -- [timidly, to Widow Quin.] -- God increase you; but I'm
pot-boy in this place, and it's here I'd liefer stay.

PEGEEN -- [triumphantly.] Now you have heard him, and go on from this.

WIDOW QUIN -- [looking round the room.] -- It's lonesome this hour
crossing the hill, and if he won't come along with me, I'd have a right
maybe to stop this night with yourselves. Let me stretch out on the
settle, Pegeen Mike; and himself can lie by the hearth.

PEGEEN -- [short and fiercely.] -- Faith, I won't. Quit off or I will
send you now.

WIDOW QUIN -- [gathering her shawl up.] -- Well, it's a terror to be
aged a score. (To Christy.) God bless you now, young fellow, and let
you be wary, or there's right torment will await you here if you go
romancing with her like, and she waiting only, as they bade me say, on a
sheepskin parchment to be wed with Shawn Keogh of Killakeen.

CHRISTY -- [going to Pegeen as she bolts the door.] -- What's that she's
after saying?

PEGEEN. Lies and blather, you've no call to mind. Well, isn't Shawn
Keogh an impudent fellow to send up spying on me? Wait till I lay hands
on him. Let him wait, I'm saying.

CHRISTY. And you're not wedding him at all?

PEGEEN. I wouldn't wed him if a bishop came walking for to join us here.

CHRISTY. That God in glory may be thanked for that.

PEGEEN. There's your bed now. I've put a quilt upon you I'm after
quilting a while since with my own two hands, and you'd best stretch out
now for your sleep, and may God give you a good rest till I call you in
the morning when the cocks will crow.

CHRISTY -- [as she goes to inner room.] -- May God and Mary and St.
Patrick bless you and reward you, for your kindly talk. [She shuts
the door behind her. He settles his bed slowly, feeling the quilt with
immense satisfaction.] -- Well, it's a clean bed and soft with it, and
it's great luck and company I've won me in the end of time -- two fine
women fighting for the likes of me -- till I'm thinking this night
wasn't I a foolish fellow not to kill my father in the years gone by.

CURTAIN




ACT II.

SCENE, [as before. Brilliant morning light. Christy, looking bright and
cheerful, is cleaning a girl's boots.]

CHRISTY -- [to himself, counting jugs on dresser.] -- Half a hundred
beyond. Ten there. A score that's above. Eighty jugs. Six cups and a
broken one. Two plates. A power of glasses. Bottles, a school-master'd
be hard set to count, and enough in them, I'm thinking, to drunken
all the wealth and wisdom of the County Clare. (He puts down the boot
carefully.) There's her boots now, nice and decent for her evening
use, and isn't it grand brushes she has? (He puts them down and goes
by degrees to the looking-glass.) Well, this'd be a fine place to be my
whole life talking out with swearing Christians, in place of my old dogs
and cat, and I stalking around, smoking my pipe and drinking my fill,
and never a day's work but drawing a cork an odd time, or wiping a
glass, or rinsing out a shiny tumbler for a decent man. (He takes the
looking-glass from the wall and puts it on the back of a chair; then
sits down in front of it and begins washing his face.) Didn't I know
rightly I was handsome, though it was the divil's own mirror we had
beyond, would twist a squint across an angel's brow; and I'll be growing
fine from this day, the way I'll have a soft lovely skin on me and won't
be the like of the clumsy young fellows do be ploughing all times in
the earth and dung. (He starts.) Is she coming again? (He looks out.)
Stranger girls. God help me, where'll I hide myself away and my long
neck nacked to the world? (He looks out.) I'd best go to the room maybe
till I'm dressed again. [He gathers up his coat and the looking-glass,
and runs into the inner room. The door is pushed open, and Susan Brady
looks in, and knocks on door.]

SUSAN. There's nobody in it. [Knocks again.]

NELLY -- [pushing her in and following her, with Honor Blake and Sara
Tansey.] It'd be early for them both to be out walking the hill.

SUSAN. I'm thinking Shawn Keogh was making game of us and there's no
such man in it at all.

HONOR -- [pointing to straw and quilt.] -- Look at that. He's been
sleeping there in the night. Well, it'll be a hard case if he's gone off
now, the way we'll never set our eyes on a man killed his father, and we
after rising early and destroying ourselves running fast on the hill.

NELLY. Are you thinking them's his boots?

SARA -- [taking them up.] -- If they are, there should be his father's
track on them. Did you never read in the papers the way murdered men do
bleed and drip?

SUSAN. Is that blood there, Sara Tansey?

SARAH -- [smelling it.] -- That's bog water, I'm thinking, but it's his
own they are surely, for I never seen the like of them for whity mud,
and red mud, and turf on them, and the fine sands of the sea. That man's
been walking, I'm telling you. [She goes down right, putting on one of
his boots.]

SUSAN -- [going to window.] -- Maybe he's stolen off to Belmullet with
the boots of Michael James, and you'd have a right so to follow after
him, Sara Tansey, and you the one yoked the ass cart and drove ten
miles to set your eyes on the man bit the yellow lady's nostril on the
northern shore. [She looks out.]

SARA -- [running to window with one boot on.] -- Don't be talking, and
we fooled to-day. (Putting on other boot.) There's a pair do fit me
well, and I'll be keeping them for walking to the priest, when you'd be
ashamed this place, going up winter and summer with nothing worth while
to confess at all.

HONOR -- [who has been listening at the door.] -- Whisht! there's
someone inside the room. (She pushes door a chink open.) It's a man.
[Sara kicks off boots and puts them where they were. They all stand in a
line looking through chink.]

SARA. I'll call him. Mister! Mister! (He puts in his head.) Is Pegeen
within?

CHRISTY -- [coming in as meek as a mouse, with the looking-glass held
behind his back.] -- She's above on the cnuceen, seeking the nanny
goats, the way she'd have a sup of goat's milk for to colour my tea.

SARA. And asking your pardon, is it you's the man killed his father?

CHRISTY -- [sidling toward the nail where the glass was hanging.] -- I
am, God help me!

SARA -- [taking eggs she has brought.] -- Then my thousand welcomes to
you, and I've run up with a brace of duck's eggs for your food today.
Pegeen's ducks is no use, but these are the real rich sort. Hold out
your hand and you'll see it's no lie I'm telling you.

CHRISTY -- [coming forward shyly, and holding out his left hand.] --
They're a great and weighty size.

SUSAN. And I run up with a pat of butter, for it'd be a poor thing to
have you eating your spuds dry, and you after running a great way since
you did destroy your da.

CHRISTY. Thank you kindly.

HONOR. And I brought you a little cut of cake, for you should have a
thin stomach on you, and you that length walking the world.

NELLY. And I brought you a little laying pullet -- boiled and all she is
-- was crushed at the fall of night by the curate's car. Feel the fat of
that breast, Mister.

CHRISTY. It's bursting, surely. [He feels it with the back of his
hand, in which he holds the presents.]

SARA. Will you pinch it? Is your right hand too sacred for to use at
all? (She slips round behind him.) It's a glass he has. Well, I never
seen to this day a man with a looking-glass held to his back. Them that
kills their fathers is a vain lot surely. [Girls giggle.]

CHRISTY -- [smiling innocently and piling presents on glass.] -- I'm
very thankful to you all to-day...

WIDOW QUIN -- [coming in quickly, at door.] -- Sara Tansey, Susan Brady,
Honor Blake! What in glory has you here at this hour of day?

GIRLS -- [giggling.] That's the man killed his father.

WIDOW QUIN -- [coming to them.] -- I know well it's the man; and
I'm after putting him down in the sports below for racing, leaping,
pitching, and the Lord knows what.

SARA -- [exuberantly.] That's right, Widow Quin. I'll bet my dowry that
he'll lick the world.

WIDOW QUIN. If you will, you'd have a right to have him fresh and
nourished in place of nursing a feast. (Taking presents.) Are you
fasting or fed, young fellow?

CHRISTY. Fasting, if you please.

WIDOW QUIN -- [loudly.] Well, you're the lot. Stir up now and give him
his breakfast. (To Christy.) Come here to me (she puts him on bench
beside her while the girls make tea and get his breakfast) and let you
tell us your story before Pegeen will come, in place of grinning your
ears off like the moon of May.

CHRISTY -- [beginning to be pleased.] -- It's a long story; you'd be
destroyed listening.

WIDOW QUIN. Don't be letting on to be shy, a fine, gamey, treacherous
lad the like of you. Was it in your house beyond you cracked his skull?

CHRISTY -- [shy but flattered.] -- It was not. We were digging spuds in
his cold, sloping, stony, divil's patch of a field.

WIDOW QUIN. And you went asking money of him, or making talk of getting
a wife would drive him from his farm?

CHRISTY. I did not, then; but there I was, digging and digging, and "You
squinting idiot," says he, "let you walk down now and tell the priest
you'll wed the Widow Casey in a score of days."

WIDOW QUIN. And what kind was she?

CHRISTY -- [with horror.] -- A walking terror from beyond the hills, and
she two score and five years, and two hundredweights and five pounds in
the weighing scales, with a limping leg on her, and a blinded eye, and
she a woman of noted misbehaviour with the old and young.

GIRLS -- [clustering round him, serving him.] -- Glory be.

WIDOW QUIN. And what did he want driving you to wed with her? [She takes
a bit of the chicken.]

CHRISTY -- [eating with growing satisfaction.] He was letting on I was
wanting a protector from the harshness of the world, and he without a
thought the whole while but how he'd have her hut to live in and her
gold to drink.

WIDOW QUIN. There's maybe worse than a dry hearth and a widow woman and
your glass at night. So you hit him then?

CHRISTY -- [getting almost excited.] -- I did not. "I won't wed her,"
says I, "when all know she did suckle me for six weeks when I came into
the world, and she a hag this day with a tongue on her has the crows and
seabirds scattered, the way they wouldn't cast a shadow on her garden
with the dread of her curse."

WIDOW QUIN -- [teasingly.] That one should be right company.

SARA -- [eagerly.] Don't mind her. Did you kill him then?

CHRISTY. "She's too good for the like of you," says he, "and go on now
or I'll flatten you out like a crawling beast has passed under a dray."
"You will not if I can help it," says I. "Go on," says he, "or I'll have
the divil making garters of your limbs tonight." "You will not if I can
help it," says I. [He sits up, brandishing his mug.]

SARA. You were right surely.

CHRISTY -- [impressively.] With that the sun came out between the cloud
and the hill, and it shining green in my face. "God have mercy on your
soul," says he, lifting a scythe; "or on your own," says I, raising the
loy. SUSAN. That's a grand story.

HONOR. He tells it lovely.

CHRISTY -- [flattered and confident, waving bone.] -- He gave a drive
with the scythe, and I gave a lep to the east. Then I turned around with
my back to the north, and I hit a blow on the ridge of his skull, laid
him stretched out, and he split to the knob of his gullet. [He raises
the chicken bone to his Adam's apple.]

GIRLS -- [together.] Well, you're a marvel! Oh, God bless you! You're
the lad surely!

SUSAN. I'm thinking the Lord God sent him this road to make a second
husband to the Widow Quin, and she with a great yearning to be wedded,
though all dread her here. Lift him on her knee, Sara Tansey.

WIDOW QUIN. Don't tease him.

SARA -- [going over to dresser and counter very quickly, and getting two
glasses and porter.] -- You're heroes surely, and let you drink a supeen
with your arms linked like the outlandish lovers in the sailor's song.
(She links their arms and gives them the glasses.) There now. Drink
a health to the wonders of the western world, the pirates, preachers,
poteen-makers, with the jobbing jockies; parching peelers, and the
juries fill their stomachs selling judgments of the English law.
[Brandishing the bottle.]

WIDOW QUIN. That's a right toast, Sara Tansey. Now Christy. [They drink
with their arms linked, he drinking with his left hand, she with her
right. As they are drinking, Pegeen Mike comes in with a milk can and
stands aghast. They all spring away from Christy. He goes down left.
Widow Quin remains seated.]

PEGEEN -- [angrily, to Sara.] -- What is it you're wanting?

SARA -- [twisting her apron.] -- An ounce of tobacco.

PEGEEN. Have you tuppence?

SARA. I've forgotten my purse.

PEGEEN. Then you'd best be getting it and not fooling us here. (To the
Widow Quin, with more elaborate scorn.) And what is it you're wanting,
Widow Quin?

WIDOW QUIN -- [insolently.] A penn'orth of starch.

PEGEEN -- [breaking out.] -- And you without a white shift or a shirt in
your whole family since the drying of the flood. I've no starch for the
like of you, and let you walk on now to Killamuck.

WIDOW QUIN -- [turning to Christy, as she goes out with the girls.] --
Well, you're mighty huffy this day, Pegeen Mike, and, you young fellow,
let you not forget the sports and racing when the noon is by. [They go
out.]

PEGEEN -- [imperiously.] Fling out that rubbish and put them cups away.
(Christy tidies away in great haste). Shove in the bench by the wall.
(He does so.) And hang that glass on the nail. What disturbed it at all?

CHRISTY -- [very meekly.] -- I was making myself decent only, and this a
fine country for young lovely girls.

PEGEEN -- [sharply.] Whisht your talking of girls. [Goes to counter
right.]

CHRISTY. Wouldn't any wish to be decent in a place...

PEGEEN. Whisht I'm saying.

CHRISTY -- [looks at her face for a moment with great misgivings, then
as a last effort, takes up a loy, and goes towards her, with feigned
assurance]. -- It was with a loy the like of that I killed my father.

PEGEEN -- [still sharply.] -- You've told me that story six times since
the dawn of day.

CHRISTY -- [reproachfully.] It's a queer thing you wouldn't care to be
hearing it and them girls after walking four miles to be listening to me
now.

PEGEEN -- [turning round astonished.] -- Four miles.

CHRISTY -- [apologetically.] Didn't himself say there were only four
bona fides living in the place?

PEGEEN. It's bona fides by the road they are, but that lot came over the
river lepping the stones. It's not three perches when you go like that,
and I was down this morning looking on the papers the post-boy does have
in his bag. (With meaning and emphasis.) For there was great news this
day, Christopher Mahon. [She goes into room left.]

CHRISTY -- [suspiciously.] Is it news of my murder?

PEGEEN -- [inside.] Murder, indeed.

CHRISTY -- [loudly.] A murdered da?

PEGEEN [coming in again and crossing right.] -- There was not, but a
story filled half a page of the hanging of a man. Ah, that should be a
fearful end, young fellow, and it worst of all for a man who destroyed
his da, for the like of him would get small mercies, and when it's dead
he is, they'd put him in a narrow grave, with cheap sacking wrapping him
round, and pour down quicklime on his head, the way you'd see a woman
pouring any frish-frash from a cup.

CHRISTY -- [very miserably.] -- Oh, God help me. Are you thinking I'm
safe? You were saying at the fall of night, I was shut of jeopardy and I
here with yourselves.

PEGEEN -- [severely.] You'll be shut of jeopardy no place if you go
talking with a pack of wild girls the like of them do be walking abroad
with the peelers, talking whispers at the fall of night.

CHRISTY -- [with terror.] -- And you're thinking they'd tell?

PEGEEN -- [with mock sympathy.] -- Who knows, God help you.

CHRISTY -- [loudly.] What joy would they have to bring hanging to the
likes of me?

PEGEEN. It's queer joys they have, and who knows the thing they'd do,
if it'd make the green stones cry itself to think of you swaying and
swiggling at the butt of a rope, and you with a fine, stout neck, God
bless you! the way you'd be a half an hour, in great anguish, getting
your death.

CHRISTY -- [getting his boots and putting them on.] -- If there's that
terror of them, it'd be best, maybe, I went on wandering like Esau or
Cain and Abel on the sides of Neifin or the Erris plain.

PEGEEN [beginning to play with him.] -- It would, maybe, for I've heard
the Circuit Judges this place is a heartless crew.

CHRISTY -- [bitterly.] It's more than Judges this place is a heartless
crew. (Looking up at her.) And isn't it a poor thing to be starting
again and I a lonesome fellow will be looking out on women and girls the
way the needy fallen spirits do be looking on the Lord?

PEGEEN. What call have you to be that lonesome when there's poor girls
walking Mayo in their thousands now?

CHRISTY -- [grimly.] It's well you know what call I have. It's well you
know it's a lonesome thing to be passing small towns with the lights
shining sideways when the night is down, or going in strange places with
a dog nosing before you and a dog nosing behind, or drawn to the cities
where you'd hear a voice kissing and talking deep love in every shadow
of the ditch, and you passing on with an empty, hungry stomach failing
from your heart.

PEGEEN. I'm thinking you're an odd man, Christy Mahon. The oddest
walking fellow I ever set my eyes on to this hour to-day.

CHRISTY. What would any be but odd men and they living lonesome in the
world?

PEGEEN. I'm not odd, and I'm my whole life with my father only.

CHRISTY -- [with infinite admiration.] -- How would a lovely handsome
woman the like of you be lonesome when all men should be thronging
around to hear the sweetness of your voice, and the little infant
children should be pestering your steps I'm thinking, and you walking
the roads.

PEGEEN. I'm hard set to know what way a coaxing fellow the like of
yourself should be lonesome either.

CHRISTY. Coaxing?

PEGEEN. Would you have me think a man never talked with the girls would
have the words you've spoken to-day? It's only letting on you are to be
lonesome, the way you'd get around me now.

CHRISTY. I wish to God I was letting on; but I was lonesome all times,
and born lonesome, I'm thinking, as the moon of dawn. [Going to door.]

PEGEEN -- [puzzled by his talk.] -- Well, it's a story I'm not
understanding at all why you'd be worse than another, Christy Mahon, and
you a fine lad with the great savagery to destroy your da.

CHRISTY. It's little I'm understanding myself, saving only that my
heart's scalded this day, and I going off stretching out the earth
between us, the way I'll not be waking near you another dawn of the year
till the two of us do arise to hope or judgment with the saints of God,
and now I'd best be going with my wattle in my hand, for hanging is a
poor thing (turning to go), and it's little welcome only is left me in
this house to-day.

PEGEEN -- [sharply.] Christy! (He turns round.) Come here to me. (He
goes towards her.) Lay down that switch and throw some sods on the fire.
You're pot-boy in this place, and I'll not have you mitch off from us
now.

CHRISTY. You were saying I'd be hanged if I stay.

PEGEEN -- [quite kindly at last.] -- I'm after going down and reading
the fearful crimes of Ireland for two weeks or three, and there wasn't a
word of your murder. (Getting up and going over to the counter.) They've
likely not found the body. You're safe so with ourselves.

CHRISTY -- [astonished, slowly.] -- It's making game of me you were
(following her with fearful joy), and I can stay so, working at your
side, and I not lonesome from this mortal day.

PEGEEN. What's to hinder you from staying, except the widow woman or the
young girls would inveigle you off?

CHRISTY -- [with rapture.] -- And I'll have your words from this day
filling my ears, and that look is come upon you meeting my two eyes, and
I watching you loafing around in the warm sun, or rinsing your ankles
when the night is come.

PEGEEN -- [kindly, but a little embarrassed.] I'm thinking you'll be
a loyal young lad to have working around, and if you vexed me a while
since with your leaguing with the girls, I wouldn't give a thraneen for
a lad hadn't a mighty spirit in him and a gamey heart. [Shawn Keogh runs
in carrying a cleeve on his back, followed by the Widow Quin.]

SHAWN -- [to Pegeen.] -- I was passing below, and I seen your mountainy
sheep eating cabbages in Jimmy's field. Run up or they'll be bursting
surely.

PEGEEN. Oh, God mend them! [She puts a shawl over her head and runs
out.]

CHRISTY -- [looking from one to the other. Still in high spirits.] --
I'd best go to her aid maybe. I'm handy with ewes.

WIDOW QUIN -- [closing the door.] -- She can do that much, and there is
Shaneen has long speeches for to tell you now. [She sits down with an
amused smile.]

SHAWN -- [taking something from his pocket and offering it to Christy.]
-- Do you see that, mister?

CHRISTY -- [looking at it.] -- The half of a ticket to the Western
States!

SHAWN -- [trembling with anxiety.] -- I'll give it to you and my new
hat (pulling it out of hamper); and my breeches with the double seat
(pulling it off); and my new coat is woven from the blackest shearings
for three miles around (giving him the coat); I'll give you the whole of
them, and my blessing, and the blessing of Father Reilly itself, maybe,
if you'll quit from this and leave us in the peace we had till last
night at the fall of dark.

CHRISTY -- [with a new arrogance.] -- And for what is it you're wanting
to get shut of me?

SHAWN -- [looking to the Widow for help.] -- I'm a poor scholar with
middling faculties to coin a lie, so I'll tell you the truth, Christy
Mahon. I'm wedding with Pegeen beyond, and I don't think well of having
a clever fearless man the like of you dwelling in her house.

CHRISTY -- [almost pugnaciously.] -- And you'd be using bribery for to
banish me?

SHAWN -- [in an imploring voice.] -- Let you not take it badly, mister
honey, isn't beyond the best place for you where you'll have golden
chains and shiny coats and you riding upon hunters with the ladies of
the land. [He makes an eager sign to the Widow Quin to come to help
him.]

WIDOW QUIN -- [coming over.] -- It's true for him, and you'd best quit
off and not have that poor girl setting her mind on you, for there's
Shaneen thinks she wouldn't suit you though all is saying that she'll
wed you now. [Christy beams with delight.]

SHAWN -- [in terrified earnest.] -- She wouldn't suit you, and she with
the divil's own temper the way you'd be strangling one another in a
score of days. (He makes the movement of strangling with his hands.)
It's the like of me only that she's fit for, a quiet simple fellow
wouldn't raise a hand upon her if she scratched itself.

WIDOW QUIN -- [putting Shawn's hat on Christy.] -- Fit them clothes
on you anyhow, young fellow, and he'd maybe loan them to you for the
sports. (Pushing him towards inner door.) Fit them on and you can give
your answer when you have them tried.

CHRISTY -- [beaming, delighted with the clothes.] -- I will then. I'd
like herself to see me in them tweeds and hat. [He goes into room and
shuts the door.]

SHAWN -- [in great anxiety.] -- He'd like herself to see them. He'll not
leave us, Widow Quin. He's a score of divils in him the way it's well
nigh certain he will wed Pegeen.

WIDOW QUIN -- [jeeringly.] It's true all girls are fond of courage and
do hate the like of you.

SHAWN -- [walking about in desperation.] -- Oh, Widow Quin, what'll I be
doing now? I'd inform again him, but he'd burst from Kilmainham and he'd
be sure and certain to destroy me. If I wasn't so God-fearing, I'd near
have courage to come behind him and run a pike into his side. Oh, it's
a hard case to be an orphan and not to have your father that you're used
to, and you'd easy kill and make yourself a hero in the sight of all.
(Coming up to her.) Oh, Widow Quin, will you find me some contrivance
when I've promised you a ewe?

WIDOW QUIN. A ewe's a small thing, but what would you give me if I did
wed him and did save you so?

SHAWN -- [with astonishment.] You?

WIDOW QUIN. Aye. Would you give me the red cow you have and the
mountainy ram, and the right of way across your rye path, and a load of
dung at Michaelmas, and turbary upon the western hill?

SHAWN -- [radiant with hope.] -- I would surely, and I'd give you the
wedding-ring I have, and the loan of a new suit, the way you'd have him
decent on the wedding-day. I'd give you two kids for your dinner, and a
gallon of poteen, and I'd call the piper on the long car to your wedding
from Crossmolina or from Ballina. I'd give you...

WIDOW QUIN. That'll do so, and let you whisht, for he's coming now
again. [Christy comes in very natty in the new clothes. Widow Quin goes
to him admiringly.]

WIDOW QUIN. If you seen yourself now, I'm thinking you'd be too proud to
speak to us at all, and it'd be a pity surely to have your like sailing
from Mayo to the Western World.

CHRISTY -- [as proud as a peacock.] -- I'm not going. If this is a poor
place itself, I'll make myself contented to be lodging here. [Widow Quin
makes a sign to Shawn to leave them.]

SHAWN. Well, I'm going measuring the race-course while the tide is low,
so I'll leave you the garments and my blessing for the sports to-day.
God bless you! [He wriggles out.]

WIDOW QUIN -- [admiring Christy.] -- Well, you're mighty spruce, young
fellow. Sit down now while you're quiet till you talk with me.

CHRISTY -- [swaggering.] I'm going abroad on the hillside for to seek
Pegeen.

WIDOW QUIN. You'll have time and plenty for to seek Pegeen, and you
heard me saying at the fall of night the two of us should be great
company.

CHRISTY. From this out I'll have no want of company when all sorts is
bringing me their food and clothing (he swaggers to the door, tightening
his belt), the way they'd set their eyes upon a gallant orphan cleft his
father with one blow to the breeches belt. (He opens door, then staggers
back.) Saints of glory! Holy angels from the throne of light!

WIDOW QUIN -- [going over.] -- What ails you?

CHRISTY. It's the walking spirit of my murdered da?

WIDOW QUIN -- [looking out.] -- Is it that tramper?

CHRISTY -- [wildly.] Where'll I hide my poor body from that ghost of
hell? [The door is pushed open, and old Mahon appears on threshold.
Christy darts in behind door.]

WIDOW QUIN -- [in great amusement.] -- Cod save you, my poor man.

MAHON -- [gruffly.] Did you see a young lad passing this way in the
early morning or the fall of night?

WIDOW QUIN. You're a queer kind to walk in not saluting at all.

MAHON. Did you see the young lad?

WIDOW QUIN -- [stiffly.] What kind was he?

MAHON. An ugly young streeler with a murderous gob on him, and a little
switch in his hand. I met a tramper seen him coming this way at the fall
of night.

WIDOW QUIN. There's harvest hundreds do be passing these days for the
Sligo boat. For what is it you're wanting him, my poor man?

MAHON. I want to destroy him for breaking the head on me with the clout
of a loy. (He takes off a big hat, and shows his head in a mass of
bandages and plaster, with some pride.) It was he did that, and amn't
I a great wonder to think I've traced him ten days with that rent in my
crown?

WIDOW QUIN -- [taking his head in both hands and examining it with
extreme delight.] -- That was a great blow. And who hit you? A robber
maybe?

MAHON. It was my own son hit me, and he the divil a robber, or anything
else, but a dirty, stuttering lout.

WIDOW -- [letting go his skull and wiping her hands in her apron.] --
You'd best be wary of a mortified scalp, I think they call it, lepping
around with that wound in the splendour of the sun. It was a bad blow
surely, and you should have vexed him fearful to make him strike that
gash in his da.

MAHON. Is it me?

WIDOW QUIN -- [amusing herself.] -- Aye. And isn't it a great shame when
the old and hardened do torment the young?

MAHON -- [raging.] Torment him is it? And I after holding out with the
patience of a martyred saint till there's nothing but destruction on,
and I'm driven out in my old age with none to aid me.

WIDOW QUIN -- [greatly amused.] -- It's a sacred wonder the way that
wickedness will spoil a man.

MAHON. My wickedness, is it? Amn't I after saying it is himself has me
destroyed, and he a liar on walls, a talker of folly, a man you'd see
stretched the half of the day in the brown ferns with his belly to the
sun.

WIDOW QUIN. Not working at all?

MAHON. The divil a work, or if he did itself, you'd see him raising up a
haystack like the stalk of a rush, or driving our last cow till he broke
her leg at the hip, and when he wasn't at that he'd be fooling over
little birds he had -- finches and felts -- or making mugs at his own
self in the bit of glass we had hung on the wall.

WIDOW QUIN -- [looking at Christy.] -- What way was he so foolish? It
was running wild after the girls may be?

MAHON -- [with a shout of derision.] -- Running wild, is it? If he seen
a red petticoat coming swinging over the hill, he'd be off to hide in
the sticks, and you'd see him shooting out his sheep's eyes between the
little twigs and the leaves, and his two ears rising like a hare looking
out through a gap. Girls, indeed!

WIDOW QUIN. It was drink maybe?

MAHON. And he a poor fellow would get drunk on the smell of a pint. He'd
a queer rotten stomach, I'm telling you, and when I gave him three pulls
from my pipe a while since, he was taken with contortions till I had to
send him in the ass cart to the females' nurse.

WIDOW QUIN -- [clasping her hands.] -- Well, I never till this day heard
tell of a man the like of that!

MAHON. I'd take a mighty oath you didn't surely, and wasn't he the
laughing joke of every female woman where four baronies meet, the way
the girls would stop their weeding if they seen him coming the road to
let a roar at him, and call him the looney of Mahon's.

WIDOW QUIN. I'd give the world and all to see the like of him. What kind
was he?

MAHON. A small low fellow.

WIDOW QUIN. And dark?

MAHON. Dark and dirty.

WIDOW QUIN -- [considering.] I'm thinking I seen him.

MAHON -- [eagerly.] An ugly young blackguard.

WIDOW QUIN. A hideous, fearful villain, and the spit of you.

MAHON. What way is he fled?

WIDOW QUIN. Gone over the hills to catch a coasting steamer to the north
or south.

MAHON. Could I pull up on him now?

WIDOW QUIN. If you'll cross the sands below where the tide is out,
you'll be in it as soon as himself, for he had to go round ten miles by
the top of the bay. (She points to the door). Strike down by the head
beyond and then follow on the roadway to the north and east. [Mahon goes
abruptly.]

WIDOW QUIN -- [shouting after him.] -- Let you give him a good vengeance
when you come up with him, but don't put yourself in the power of the
law, for it'd be a poor thing to see a judge in his black cap reading
out his sentence on a civil warrior the like of you. [She swings the
door to and looks at Christy, who is cowering in terror, for a moment,
then she bursts into a laugh.]

WIDOW QUIN. Well, you're the walking Playboy of the Western World, and
that's the poor man you had divided to his breeches belt.

CHRISTY -- [looking out: then, to her.] -- What'll Pegeen say when she
hears that story? What'll she be saying to me now?

WIDOW QUIN. She'll knock the head of you, I'm thinking, and drive you
from the door. God help her to be taking you for a wonder, and you a
little schemer making up the story you destroyed your da.

CHRISTY -- [turning to the door, nearly speechless with rage, half to
himself.] -- To be letting on he was dead, and coming back to his life,
and following after me like an old weazel tracing a rat, and coming
in here laying desolation between my own self and the fine women of
Ireland, and he a kind of carcase that you'd fling upon the sea...

WIDOW QUIN -- [more soberly.] -- There's talking for a man's one only
son.

CHRISTY -- [breaking out.] -- His one son, is it? May I meet him with
one tooth and it aching, and one eye to be seeing seven and seventy
divils in the twists of the road, and one old timber leg on him to limp
into the scalding grave. (Looking out.) There he is now crossing the
strands, and that the Lord God would send a high wave to wash him from
the world.

WIDOW QUIN -- [scandalised.] Have you no shame? (putting her hand on his
shoulder and turning him round.) What ails you? Near crying, is it?

CHRISTY -- [in despair and grief.] -- Amn't I after seeing the
love-light of the star of knowledge shining from her brow, and hearing
words would put you thinking on the holy Brigid speaking to the infant
saints, and now she'll be turning again, and speaking hard words to me,
like an old woman with a spavindy ass she'd have, urging on a hill.

WIDOW QUIN. There's poetry talk for a girl you'd see itching and
scratching, and she with a stale stink of poteen on her from selling in
the shop.

CHRISTY -- [impatiently.] It's her like is fitted to be handling
merchandise in the heavens above, and what'll I be doing now, I ask
you, and I a kind of wonder was jilted by the heavens when a day was by.
[There is a distant noise of girls' voices. Widow Quin looks from window
and comes to him, hurriedly.]

WIDOW QUIN. You'll be doing like myself, I'm thinking, when I did
destroy my man, for I'm above many's the day, odd times in great
spirits, abroad in the sunshine, darning a stocking or stitching a
shift; and odd times again looking out on the schooners, hookers,
trawlers is sailing the sea, and I thinking on the gallant hairy fellows
are drifting beyond, and myself long years living alone.

CHRISTY -- [interested.] You're like me, so.

WIDOW QUIN. I am your like, and it's for that I'm taking a fancy to you,
and I with my little houseen above where there'd be myself to tend you,
and none to ask were you a murderer or what at all.

CHRISTY. And what would I be doing if I left Pegeen?

WIDOW QUIN. I've nice jobs you could be doing, gathering shells to make
a whitewash for our hut within, building up a little goose-house, or
stretching a new skin on an old curragh I have, and if my hut is far
from all sides, it's there you'll meet the wisest old men, I tell you,
at the corner of my wheel, and it's there yourself and me will have
great times whispering and hugging.. ..

VOICES -- [outside, calling far away.] -- Christy! Christy Mahon!
Christy!

CHRISTY. Is it Pegeen Mike?

WIDOW QUIN. It's the young girls, I'm thinking, coming to bring you to
the sports below, and what is it you'll have me to tell them now?

CHRISTY. Aid me for to win Pegeen. It's herself only that I'm seeking
now. (Widow Quin gets up and goes to window.) Aid me for to win her, and
I'll be asking God to stretch a hand to you in the hour of death, and
lead you short cuts through the Meadows of Ease, and up the floor of
Heaven to the Footstool of the Virgin's Son.

WIDOW QUIN. There's praying.

VOICES -- [nearer.] Christy! Christy Mahon!

CHRISTY -- [with agitation.] -- They're coming. Will you swear to aid
and save me for the love of Christ?

WIDOW QUIN -- [looks at him for a moment.] -- If I aid you, will you
swear to give me a right of way I want, and a mountainy ram, and a load
of dung at Michaelmas, the time that you'll be master here?

CHRISTY. I will, by the elements and stars of night.

WIDOW QUIN. Then we'll not say a word of the old fellow, the way Pegeen
won't know your story till the end of time.

CHRISTY. And if he chances to return again?

WIDOW QUIN. We'll swear he's a maniac and not your da. I could take an
oath I seen him raving on the sands to-day. [Girls run in.]

SUSAN. Come on to the sports below. Pegeen says you're to come.

SARA TANSEY. The lepping's beginning, and we've a jockey's suit to fit
upon you for the mule race on the sands below.

HONOR. Come on, will you?

CHRISTY. I will then if Pegeen's beyond.

SARA. She's in the boreen making game of Shaneen Keogh.

CHRISTY. Then I'll be going to her now. [He runs out followed by the
girls.]

WIDOW QUIN. Well, if the worst comes in the end of all, it'll be great
game to see there's none to pity him but a widow woman, the like of me,
has buried her children and destroyed her man. [She goes out.]

CURTAIN




ACT III.

SCENE, [as before. Later in the day. Jimmy comes in, slightly drunk.]

JIMMY -- [calls.] Pegeen! (Crosses to inner door.) Pegeen Mike! (Comes
back again into the room.) Pegeen! (Philly comes in in the same state.)
(To Philly.) Did you see herself?

PHILLY. I did not; but I sent Shawn Keogh with the ass cart for to bear
him home. (Trying cupboards which are locked.) Well, isn't he a nasty
man to get into such staggers at a morning wake? and isn't herself the
divil's daughter for locking, and she so fussy after that young gaffer,
you might take your death with drought and none to heed you?

JIMMY. It's little wonder she'd be fussy, and he after bringing bankrupt
ruin on the roulette man, and the trick-o'-the-loop man, and breaking
the nose of the cockshot-man, and winning all in the sports below,
racing, lepping, dancing, and the Lord knows what! He's right luck, I'm
telling you.

PHILLY. If he has, he'll be rightly hobbled yet, and he not able to say
ten words without making a brag of the way he killed his father, and the
great blow he hit with the loy.

JIMMY. A man can't hang by his own informing, and his father should be
rotten by now. [Old Mahon passes window slowly.]

PHILLY. Supposing a man's digging spuds in that field with a long spade,
and supposing he flings up the two halves of that skull, what'll be said
then in the papers and the courts of law?

JIMMY. They'd say it was an old Dane, maybe, was drowned in the flood.
(Old Mahon comes in and sits down near door listening.) Did you never
hear tell of the skulls they have in the city of Dublin, ranged out like
blue jugs in a cabin of Connaught?

PHILLY. And you believe that?

JIMMY -- [pugnaciously.] Didn't a lad see them and he after coming
from harvesting in the Liverpool boat? "They have them there," says he,
"making a show of the great people there was one time walking the world.
White skulls and black skulls and yellow skulls, and some with full
teeth, and some haven't only but one."

PHILLY. It was no lie, maybe, for when I was a young lad there was a
graveyard beyond the house with the remnants of a man who had thighs as
long as your arm. He was a horrid man, I'm telling you, and there was
many a fine Sunday I'd put him together for fun, and he with shiny
bones, you wouldn't meet the like of these days in the cities of the
world.

MAHON -- [getting up.] -- You wouldn't is it? Lay your eyes on that
skull, and tell me where and when there was another the like of it, is
splintered only from the blow of a loy.

PHILLY. Glory be to God! And who hit you at all?

MAHON -- [triumphantly.] It was my own son hit me. Would you believe
that?

JIMMY. Well, there's wonders hidden in the heart of man!

PHILLY -- [suspiciously.] And what way was it done?

MAHON -- [wandering about the room.] -- I'm after walking hundreds and
long scores of miles, winning clean beds and the fill of my belly four
times in the day, and I doing nothing but telling stories of that naked
truth. (He comes to them a little aggressively.) Give me a supeen and
I'll tell you now. [Widow Quin comes in and stands aghast behind him. He
is facing Jimmy and Philly, who are on the left.]

JIMMY. Ask herself beyond. She's the stuff hidden in her shawl.

WIDOW QUIN -- [coming to Mahon quickly.] -- you here, is it? You didn't
go far at all?

MAHON. I seen the coasting steamer passing, and I got a drought upon me
and a cramping leg, so I said, "The divil go along with him," and turned
again. (Looking under her shawl.) And let you give me a supeen, for I'm
destroyed travelling since Tuesday was a week.

WIDOW QUIN -- [getting a glass, in a cajoling tone.] -- Sit down then by
the fire and take your ease for a space. You've a right to be destroyed
indeed, with your walking, and fighting, and facing the sun (giving him
poteen from a stone jar she has brought in.) There now is a drink for
you, and may it be to your happiness and length of life.

MAHON -- [taking glass greedily and sitting down by fire.] -- God
increase you!

WIDOW QUIN -- [taking men to the right stealthily.] -- Do you know what?
That man's raving from his wound to-day, for I met him a while since
telling a rambling tale of a tinker had him destroyed. Then he heard of
Christy's deed, and he up and says it was his son had cracked his skull.
O isn't madness a fright, for he'll go killing someone yet, and he
thinking it's the man has struck him so?

JIMMY -- [entirely convinced.] It's a fright, surely. I knew a party
was kicked in the head by a red mare, and he went killing horses a great
while, till he eat the insides of a clock and died after.

PHILLY -- [with suspicion.] -- Did he see Christy?

WIDOW QUIN. He didn't. (With a warning gesture.) Let you not be putting
him in mind of him, or you'll be likely summoned if there's murder done.
(Looking round at Mahon.) Whisht! He's listening. Wait now till you hear
me taking him easy and unravelling all. (She goes to Mahon.) And what
way are you feeling, mister? Are you in contentment now?

MAHON -- [slightly emotional from his drink.] -- I'm poorly only, for
it's a hard story the way I'm left to-day, when it was I did tend him
from his hour of birth, and he a dunce never reached his second book,
the way he'd come from school, many's the day, with his legs lamed under
him, and he blackened with his beatings like a tinker's ass. It's a hard
story, I'm saying, the way some do have their next and nighest raising
up a hand of murder on them, and some is lonesome getting their death
with lamentation in the dead of night.

WIDOW QUIN -- [not knowing what to say.] -- To hear you talking so
quiet, who'd know you were the same fellow we seen pass to-day?

MAHON. I'm the same surely. The wrack and ruin of three score years;
and it's a terror to live that length, I tell you, and to have your
sons going to the dogs against you, and you wore out scolding them, and
skelping them, and God knows what.

PHILLY -- [to Jimmy.] -- He's not raving. (To Widow Quin.) Will you ask
him what kind was his son?

WIDOW QUIN -- [to Mahon, with a peculiar look.] -- Was your son that
hit you a lad of one year and a score maybe, a great hand at racing and
lepping and licking the world?

MAHON -- [turning on her with a roar of rage.] -- Didn't you hear me say
he was the fool of men, the way from this out he'll know the orphan's
lot with old and young making game of him and they swearing, raging,
kicking at him like a mangy cur. [A great burst of cheering outside,
someway off.]

MAHON -- [putting his hands to his ears.] -- What in the name of God do
they want roaring below?

WIDOW QUIN -- [with the shade of a smile.] -- They're cheering a young
lad, the champion Playboy of the Western World. [More cheering.]

MAHON -- [going to window.] It'd split my heart to hear them, and I with
pulses in my brain-pan for a week gone by. Is it racing they are?

JIMMY -- [looking from door.] -- It is then. They are mounting him for
the mule race will be run upon the sands. That's the playboy on the
winkered mule.

MAHON [puzzled.] That lad, is it? If you said it was a fool he was,
I'd have laid a mighty oath he was the likeness of my wandering son
(uneasily, putting his hand to his head.) Faith, I'm thinking I'll go
walking for to view the race.

WIDOW QUIN -- [stopping him, sharply.] -- You will not. You'd best take
the road to Belmullet, and not be dilly-dallying in this place where
there isn't a spot you could sleep.

PHILLY -- [coming forward.] -- Don't mind her. Mount there on the bench
and you'll have a view of the whole. They're hurrying before the tide
will rise, and it'd be near over if you went down the pathway through
the crags below.

MAHON [mounts on bench, Widow Quin beside him.] -- That's a right view
again the edge of the sea. They're coming now from the point. He's
leading. Who is he at all?

WIDOW QUIN. He's the champion of the world, I tell you, and there isn't
a hop'orth isn't falling lucky to his hands to-day.

PHILLY -- [looking out, interested in the race.] -- Look at that.
They're pressing him now.

JIMMY. He'll win it yet.

PHILLY. Take your time, Jimmy Farrell. It's too soon to say.

WIDOW QUIN -- [shouting.] Watch him taking the gate. There's riding.

JIMMY -- [cheering.] More power to the young lad!

MAHON. He's passing the third.

JIMMY. He'll lick them yet!

WIDOW QUIN. He'd lick them if he was running races with a score itself.

MAHON. Look at the mule he has, kicking the stars.

WIDOW QUIN. There was a lep! (catching hold of Mahon in her excitement.)
He's fallen! He's mounted again! Faith, he's passing them all!

JIMMY. Look at him skelping her!

PHILLY. And the mountain girls hooshing him on!

JIMMY. It's the last turn! The post's cleared for them now!

MAHON. Look at the narrow place. He'll be into the bogs! (With a yell.)
Good rider! He's through it again!

JIMMY. He neck and neck!

MAHON. Good boy to him! Flames, but he's in! [Great cheering, in which
all join.]

MAHON [with hesitation.] What's that? They're raising him up. They're
coming this way. (With a roar of rage and astonishment.) It's Christy!
by the stars of God! I'd know his way of spitting and he astride the
moon. [He jumps down and makes for the door, but Widow Quin catches him
and pulls him back.]

WIDOW QUIN. Stay quiet, will you. That's not your son. (To Jimmy.) Stop
him, or you'll get a month for the abetting of manslaughter and be fined
as well.

JIMMY. I'll hold him.

MAHON [struggling.] Let me out! Let me out, the lot of you! till I have
my vengeance on his head to-day.

WIDOW QUIN -- [shaking him, vehemently.] -- That's not your son. That's
a man is going to make a marriage with the daughter of this house, a
place with fine trade, with a license, and with poteen too.

MAHON -- [amazed.] That man marrying a decent and a moneyed girl! Is it
mad yous are? Is it in a crazy-house for females that I'm landed now?

WIDOW QUIN. It's mad yourself is with the blow upon your head. That lad
is the wonder of the Western World.

MAHON. I seen it's my son.

WIDOW QUIN. You seen that you're mad. (Cheering outside.) Do you hear
them cheering him in the zig-zags of the road? Aren't you after saying
that your son's a fool, and how would they be cheering a true idiot
born?

MAHON -- [getting distressed.] -- It's maybe out of reason that that
man's himself. (Cheering again.) There's none surely will go cheering
him. Oh, I'm raving with a madness that would fright the world! (He sits
down with his hand to his head.) There was one time I seen ten scarlet
divils letting on they'd cork my spirit in a gallon can; and one time I
seen rats as big as badgers sucking the life blood from the butt of
my lug; but I never till this day confused that dribbling idiot with a
likely man. I'm destroyed surely.

WIDOW QUIN. And who'd wonder when it's your brain-pan that is gaping
now?

MAHON. Then the blight of the sacred drought upon myself and him, for
I never went mad to this day, and I not three weeks with the Limerick
girls drinking myself silly, and parlatic from the dusk to dawn. (To
Widow Quin, suddenly.) Is my visage astray?

WIDOW QUIN. It is then. You're a sniggering maniac, a child could see.

MAHON -- [getting up more cheerfully.] -- Then I'd best be going to
the union beyond, and there'll be a welcome before me, I tell you (with
great pride), and I a terrible and fearful case, the way that there I
was one time, screeching in a straightened waistcoat, with seven doctors
writing out my sayings in a printed book. Would you believe that?

WIDOW QUIN. If you're a wonder itself, you'd best be hasty, for them
lads caught a maniac one time and pelted the poor creature till he ran
out, raving and foaming, and was drowned in the sea.

MAHON -- [with philosophy.] -- It's true mankind is the divil when your
head's astray. Let me out now and I'll slip down the boreen, and not see
them so.

WIDOW QUIN -- [showing him out.] -- That's it. Run to the right, and not
a one will see. [He runs off.]

PHILLY -- [wisely.] You're at some gaming, Widow Quin; but I'll walk
after him and give him his dinner and a time to rest, and I'll see then
if he's raving or as sane as you.

WIDOW QUIN -- [annoyed.] If you go near that lad, let you be wary of
your head, I'm saying. Didn't you hear him telling he was crazed at
times?

PHILLY. I heard him telling a power; and I'm thinking we'll have right
sport, before night will fall. [He goes out.]

JIMMY. Well, Philly's a conceited and foolish man. How could that madman
have his senses and his brain-pan slit? I'll go after them and see him
turn on Philly now. [He goes; Widow Quin hides poteen behind counter.
Then hubbub outside.]

VOICES. There you are! Good jumper! Grand lepper! Darlint boy! He's the
racer! Bear him on, will you! [Christy comes in, in Jockey's dress, with
Pegeen Mike, Sara, and other girls, and men.]

PEGEEN -- [to crowd.] -- Go on now and don't destroy him and he
drenching with sweat. Go along, I'm saying, and have your tug-of-warring
till he's dried his skin.

CROWD. Here's his prizes! A bagpipes! A fiddle was played by a poet in
the years gone by! A flat and three-thorned blackthorn would lick the
scholars out of Dublin town!

CHRISTY -- [taking prizes from the men.] -- Thank you kindly, the lot of
you. But you'd say it was little only I did this day if you'd seen me a
while since striking my one single blow.

TOWN CRIER -- [outside, ringing a bell.] -- Take notice, last event of
this day! Tug-of-warring on the green below! Come on, the lot of you!
Great achievements for all Mayo men!

PEGEEN. Go on, and leave him for to rest and dry. Go on, I tell you, for
he'll do no more. (She hustles crowd out; Widow Quin following them.)

MEN -- [going.] -- Come on then. Good luck for the while!

PEGEEN -- [radiantly, wiping his face with her shawl.] -- Well, you're
the lad, and you'll have great times from this out when you could win
that wealth of prizes, and you sweating in the heat of noon!

CHRISTY -- [looking at her with delight.] -- I'll have great times if
I win the crowning prize I'm seeking now, and that's your promise that
you'll wed me in a fortnight, when our banns is called.

PEGEEN -- [backing away from him.] -- You've right daring to go ask
me that, when all knows you'll be starting to some girl in your own
townland, when your father's rotten in four months, or five.

CHRISTY -- [indignantly.] Starting from you, is it? (He follows her.)
I will not, then, and when the airs is warming in four months, or five,
it's then yourself and me should be pacing Neifin in the dews of night,
the times sweet smells do be rising, and you'd see a little shiny new
moon, maybe, sinking on the hills.

PEGEEN [looking at him playfully.] -- And it's that kind of a poacher's
love you'd make, Christy Mahon, on the sides of Neifin, when the night
is down?

CHRISTY. It's little you'll think if my love's a poacher's, or an
earl's itself, when you'll feel my two hands stretched around you, and I
squeezing kisses on your puckered lips, till I'd feel a kind of pity for
the Lord God is all ages sitting lonesome in his golden chair.

PEGEEN. That'll be right fun, Christy Mahon, and any girl would walk her
heart out before she'd meet a young man was your like for eloquence, or
talk, at all.

CHRISTY -- [encouraged.] Let you wait, to hear me talking, till we're
astray in Erris, when Good Friday's by, drinking a sup from a well,
and making mighty kisses with our wetted mouths, or gaming in a gap
or sunshine, with yourself stretched back unto your necklace, in the
flowers of the earth.

PEGEEN -- [in a lower voice, moved by his tone.] -- I'd be nice so, is
it?

CHRISTY -- [with rapture.] -- If the mitred bishops seen you that time,
they'd be the like of the holy prophets, I'm thinking, do be straining
the bars of Paradise to lay eyes on the Lady Helen of Troy, and she
abroad, pacing back and forward, with a nosegay in her golden shawl.

PEGEEN -- [with real tenderness.] -- And what is it I have, Christy
Mahon, to make me fitting entertainment for the like of you, that has
such poet's talking, and such bravery of heart?

CHRISTY -- [in a low voice.] -- Isn't there the light of seven heavens
in your heart alone, the way you'll be an angel's lamp to me from this
out, and I abroad in the darkness, spearing salmons in the Owen, or the
Carrowmore?

PEGEEN. If I was your wife, I'd be along with you those nights, Christy
Mahon, the way you'd see I was a great hand at coaxing bailiffs, or
coining funny nick-names for the stars of night.

CHRISTY. You, is it? Taking your death in the hailstones, or in the fogs
of dawn.

PEGEEN. Yourself and me would shelter easy in a narrow bush, (with a
qualm of dread) but we're only talking, maybe, for this would be a poor,
thatched place to hold a fine lad is the like of you.

CHRISTY -- [putting his arm round her.] -- If I wasn't a good Christian,
it's on my naked knees I'd be saying my prayers and paters to every
jackstraw you have roofing your head, and every stony pebble is paving
the laneway to your door.

PEGEEN -- [radiantly.] If that's the truth, I'll be burning candles from
this out to the miracles of God that have brought you from the south
to-day, and I, with my gowns bought ready, the way that I can wed you,
and not wait at all.

CHRISTY. It's miracles, and that's the truth. Me there toiling a long
while, and walking a long while, not knowing at all I was drawing all
times nearer to this holy day.

PEGEEN. And myself, a girl, was tempted often to go sailing the seas
till I'd marry a Jew-man, with ten kegs of gold, and I not knowing at
all there was the like of you drawing nearer, like the stars of God.

CHRISTY. And to think I'm long years hearing women talking that talk,
to all bloody fools, and this the first time I've heard the like of your
voice talking sweetly for my own delight.

PEGEEN. And to think it's me is talking sweetly, Christy Mahon, and I
the fright of seven townlands for my biting tongue. Well, the heart's a
wonder; and, I'm thinking, there won't be our like in Mayo, for gallant
lovers, from this hour, to-day. (Drunken singing is heard outside.)
There's my father coming from the wake, and when he's had his sleep
we'll tell him, for he's peaceful then. [They separate.]

MICHAEL -- [singing outside] -- The jailor and the turnkey They quickly
ran us down, And brought us back as prisoners Once more to Cavan town.
[He comes in supported by Shawn.] There we lay bewailing All in a prison
bound.... [He sees Christy. Goes and shakes him drunkenly by the hand,
while Pegeen and Shawn talk on the left.]

MICHAEL -- [to Christy.] -- The blessing of God and the holy angels on
your head, young fellow. I hear tell you're after winning all in the
sports below; and wasn't it a shame I didn't bear you along with me to
Kate Cassidy's wake, a fine, stout lad, the like of you, for you'd never
see the match of it for flows of drink, the way when we sunk her bones
at noonday in her narrow grave, there were five men, aye, and six men,
stretched out retching speechless on the holy stones.

CHRISTY -- [uneasily, watching Pegeen.] -- Is that the truth?

MICHAEL. It is then, and aren't you a louty schemer to go burying your
poor father unbeknownst when you'd a right to throw him on the crupper
of a Kerry mule and drive him westwards, like holy Joseph in the days
gone by, the way we could have given him a decent burial, and not have
him rotting beyond, and not a Christian drinking a smart drop to the
glory of his soul?

CHRISTY -- [gruffly.] It's well enough he's lying, for the likes of him.

MICHAEL -- [slapping him on the back.] -- Well, aren't you a hardened
slayer? It'll be a poor thing for the household man where you go
sniffing for a female wife; and (pointing to Shawn) look beyond at that
shy and decent Christian I have chosen for my daughter's hand, and I
after getting the gilded dispensation this day for to wed them now.

CHRISTY. And you'll be wedding them this day, is it?

MICHAEL -- [drawing himself up.] -- Aye. Are you thinking, if I'm drunk
itself, I'd leave my daughter living single with a little frisky rascal
is the like of you?

PEGEEN -- [breaking away from Shawn.] -- Is it the truth the
dispensation's come?

MICHAEL -- [triumphantly.] Father Reilly's after reading it in gallous
Latin, and "It's come in the nick of time," says he; "so I'll wed them
in a hurry, dreading that young gaffer who'd capsize the stars."

PEGEEN -- [fiercely.] He's missed his nick of time, for it's that lad,
Christy Mahon, that I'm wedding now.

MICHAEL -- [loudly with horror.] -- You'd be making him a son to me, and
he wet and crusted with his father's blood?

PEGEEN. Aye. Wouldn't it be a bitter thing for a girl to go marrying the
like of Shaneen, and he a middling kind of a scarecrow, with no savagery
or fine words in him at all?

MICHAEL -- [gasping and sinking on a chair.] -- Oh, aren't you a heathen
daughter to go shaking the fat of my heart, and I swamped and drownded
with the weight of drink? Would you have them turning on me the way that
I'd be roaring to the dawn of day with the wind upon my heart? Have you
not a word to aid me, Shaneen? Are you not jealous at all?

SHANEEN -- [In great misery.] -- I'd be afeard to be jealous of a man
did slay his da.

PEGEEN. Well, it'd be a poor thing to go marrying your like. I'm seeing
there's a world of peril for an orphan girl, and isn't it a great
blessing I didn't wed you, before himself came walking from the west or
south?

SHAWN. It's a queer story you'd go picking a dirty tramp up from the
highways of the world.

PEGEEN -- [playfully.] And you think you're a likely beau to go straying
along with, the shiny Sundays of the opening year, when it's sooner on
a bullock's liver you'd put a poor girl thinking than on the lily or the
rose?

SHAWN. And have you no mind of my weight of passion, and the holy
dispensation, and the drift of heifers I am giving, and the golden ring?

PEGEEN. I'm thinking you're too fine for the like of me, Shawn Keogh of
Killakeen, and let you go off till you'd find a radiant lady with droves
of bullocks on the plains of Meath, and herself bedizened in the diamond
jewelleries of Pharaoh's ma. That'd be your match, Shaneen. So God save
you now! [She retreats behind Christy.]

SHAWN. Won't you hear me telling you...?

CHRISTY -- [with ferocity.] -- Take yourself from this, young fellow, or
I'll maybe add a murder to my deeds to-day.

MICHAEL -- [springing up with a shriek.] -- Murder is it? Is it mad yous
are? Would you go making murder in this place, and it piled with poteen
for our drink to-night? Go on to the foreshore if it's fighting you
want, where the rising tide will wash all traces from the memory of man.
[Pushing Shawn towards Christy.]

SHAWN -- [shaking himself free, and getting behind Michael.] -- I'll
not fight him, Michael James. I'd liefer live a bachelor, simmering in
passions to the end of time, than face a lepping savage the like of him
has descended from the Lord knows where. Strike him yourself, Michael
James, or you'll lose my drift of heifers and my blue bull from Sneem.

MICHAEL. Is it me fight him, when it's father-slaying he's bred to now?
(Pushing Shawn.) Go on you fool and fight him now.

SHAWN -- [coming forward a little.] -- Will I strike him with my hand?

MICHAEL. Take the loy is on your western side.

SHAWN. I'd be afeard of the gallows if I struck him with that.

CHRISTY -- [taking up the loy.] -- Then I'll make you face the gallows
or quit off from this. [Shawn flies out of the door.]

CHRISTY. Well, fine weather be after him, (going to Michael, coaxingly)
and I'm thinking you wouldn't wish to have that quaking blackguard in
your house at all. Let you give us your blessing and hear her swear her
faith to me, for I'm mounted on the spring-tide of the stars of luck,
the way it'll be good for any to have me in the house.

PEGEEN [at the other side of Michael.] -- Bless us now, for I swear to
God I'll wed him, and I'll not renege.

MICHAEL -- [standing up in the centre, holding on to both of them.] --
It's the will of God, I'm thinking, that all should win an easy or a
cruel end, and it's the will of God that all should rear up lengthy
families for the nurture of the earth. What's a single man, I ask you,
eating a bit in one house and drinking a sup in another, and he with no
place of his own, like an old braying jackass strayed upon the rocks?
(To Christy.) It's many would be in dread to bring your like into their
house for to end them, maybe, with a sudden end; but I'm a decent man
of Ireland, and I liefer face the grave untimely and I seeing a score of
grandsons growing up little gallant swearers by the name of God, than
go peopling my bedside with puny weeds the like of what you'd breed, I'm
thinking, out of Shaneen Keogh. (He joins their hands.) A daring fellow
is the jewel of the world, and a man did split his father's middle with
a single clout, should have the bravery of ten, so may God and Mary and
St. Patrick bless you, and increase you from this mortal day.

CHRISTY AND PEGEEN. Amen, O Lord!

[Hubbub outside.]

[Old Mahon rushes in, followed by all the crowd, and Widow Quin. He
makes a rush at Christy, knocks him down, and begins to beat him.]

PEGEEN -- [dragging back his arm.] -- Stop that, will you. Who are you
at all?

MAHON. His father, God forgive me!

PEGEEN -- [drawing back.] -- Is it rose from the dead?

MAHON. Do you think I look so easy quenched with the tap of a loy?
[Beats Christy again.]

PEGEEN -- [glaring at Christy.] -- And it's lies you told, letting on
you had him slitted, and you nothing at all.

CHRISTY -- [clutching Mahon's stick.] -- He's not my father. He's a
raving maniac would scare the world. (Pointing to Widow Quin.) Herself
knows it is true.

CROWD. You're fooling Pegeen! The Widow Quin seen him this day, and you
likely knew! You're a liar!

CHRISTY -- [dumbfounded.] It's himself was a liar, lying stretched out
with an open head on him, letting on he was dead.

MAHON. Weren't you off racing the hills before I got my breath with the
start I had seeing you turn on me at all?

PEGEEN. And to think of the coaxing glory we had given him, and he after
doing nothing but hitting a soft blow and chasing northward in a sweat
of fear. Quit off from this.

CHRISTY -- [piteously.] You've seen my doings this day, and let you save
me from the old man; for why would you be in such a scorch of haste to
spur me to destruction now?

PEGEEN. It's there your treachery is spurring me, till I'm hard set to
think you're the one I'm after lacing in my heart-strings half-an-hour
gone by. (To Mahon.) Take him on from this, for I think bad the world
should see me raging for a Munster liar, and the fool of men.

MAHON. Rise up now to retribution, and come on with me.

CROWD -- [jeeringly.] There's the playboy! There's the lad thought he'd
rule the roost in Mayo. Slate him now, mister.

CHRISTY -- [getting up in shy terror.] -- What is it drives you to
torment me here, when I'd asked the thunders of the might of God to
blast me if I ever did hurt to any saving only that one single blow.

MAHON -- [loudly.] If you didn't, you're a poor good-for-nothing, and
isn't it by the like of you the sins of the whole world are committed?

CHRISTY -- [raising his hands.] -- In the name of the Almighty God....

MAHON. Leave troubling the Lord God. Would you have him sending down
droughts, and fevers, and the old hen and the cholera morbus?

CHRISTY -- [to Widow Quin.] -- Will you come between us and protect me
now?

WIDOW QUIN. I've tried a lot, God help me, and my share is done.

CHRISTY -- [looking round in desperation.] -- And I must go back into
my torment is it, or run off like a vagabond straying through the Unions
with the dusts of August making mudstains in the gullet of my throat,
or the winds of March blowing on me till I'd take an oath I felt them
making whistles of my ribs within?

SARA. Ask Pegeen to aid you. Her like does often change.

CHRISTY. I will not then, for there's torment in the splendour of her
like, and she a girl any moon of midnight would take pride to meet,
facing southwards on the heaths of Keel. But what did I want crawling
forward to scorch my understanding at her flaming brow?

PEGEEN -- [to Mahon, vehemently, fearing she will break into tears.] --
Take him on from this or I'll set the young lads to destroy him here.

MAHON -- [going to him, shaking his stick.] -- Come on now if you
wouldn't have the company to see you skelped.

PEGEEN -- [half laughing, through her tears.] -- That's it, now the
world will see him pandied, and he an ugly liar was playing off the
hero, and the fright of men.

CHRISTY -- [to Mahon, very sharply.] -- Leave me go!

CROWD. That's it. Now Christy. If them two set fighting, it will lick
the world.

MAHON -- [making a grab at Christy.] -- Come here to me.

CHRISTY -- [more threateningly.] -- Leave me go, I'm saying.

MAHON. I will maybe, when your legs is limping, and your back is blue.

CROWD. Keep it up, the two of you. I'll back the old one. Now the
playboy.

CHRISTY -- [in low and intense voice.] -- Shut your yelling, for if
you're after making a mighty man of me this day by the power of a lie,
you're setting me now to think if it's a poor thing to be lonesome,
it's worse maybe to go mixing with the fools of earth. [Mahon makes a
movement towards him.]

CHRISTY -- [almost shouting.] -- Keep off... lest I do show a blow
unto the lot of you would set the guardian angels winking in the clouds
above. [He swings round with a sudden rapid movement and picks up a
loy.]

CROWD -- [half frightened, half amused.] -- He's going mad! Mind
yourselves! Run from the idiot!

CHRISTY. If I am an idiot, I'm after hearing my voice this day saying
words would raise the topknot on a poet in a merchant's town. I've won
your racing, and your lepping, and...

MAHON. Shut your gullet and come on with me.

CHRISTY. I'm going, but I'll stretch you first. [He runs at old Mahon
with the loy, chases him out of the door, followed by crowd and Widow
Quin. There is a great noise outside, then a yell, and dead silence for
a moment. Christy comes in, half dazed, and goes to fire.]

WIDOW QUIN -- [coming in, hurriedly, and going to him.] -- They're
turning again you. Come on, or you'll be hanged, indeed.

CHRISTY. I'm thinking, from this out, Pegeen'll be giving me praises the
same as in the hours gone by.

WIDOW QUIN -- [impatiently.] Come by the back-door. I'd think bad to
have you stifled on the gallows tree.

CHRISTY -- [indignantly.] I will not, then. What good'd be my life-time,
if I left Pegeen?

WIDOW QUIN. Come on, and you'll be no worse than you were last night;
and you with a double murder this time to be telling to the girls.

CHRISTY. I'll not leave Pegeen Mike.

WIDOW QUIN -- [impatiently.] Isn't there the match of her in every
parish public, from Binghamstown unto the plain of Meath? Come on, I
tell you, and I'll find you finer sweethearts at each waning moon.

CHRISTY. It's Pegeen I'm seeking only, and what'd I care if you brought
me a drift of chosen females, standing in their shifts itself, maybe,
from this place to the Eastern World?

SARA -- [runs in, pulling off one of her petticoats.] -- They're going
to hang him. (Holding out petticoat and shawl.) Fit these upon him, and
let him run off to the east.

WIDOW QUIN. He's raving now; but we'll fit them on him, and I'll take
him, in the ferry, to the Achill boat.

CHRISTY -- [struggling feebly.] -- Leave me go, will you? when I'm
thinking of my luck to-day, for she will wed me surely, and I a proven
hero in the end of all. [They try to fasten petticoat round him.]

WIDOW QUIN. Take his left hand, and we'll pull him now. Come on, young
fellow.

CHRISTY -- [suddenly starting up.] -- You'll be taking me from her?
You're jealous, is it, of her wedding me? Go on from this. [He snatches
up a stool, and threatens them with it.]

WIDOW QUIN -- [going.] -- It's in the mad-house they should put him,
not in jail, at all. We'll go by the back-door, to call the doctor, and
we'll save him so. [She goes out, with Sara, through inner room. Men
crowd in the doorway. Christy sits down again by the fire.]

MICHAEL -- [in a terrified whisper.] -- Is the old lad killed surely?

PHILLY. I'm after feeling the last gasps quitting his heart. [They peer
in at Christy.]

MICHAEL -- [with a rope.] -- Look at the way he is. Twist a hangman's
knot on it, and slip it over his head, while he's not minding at all.

PHILLY. Let you take it, Shaneen. You're the soberest of all that's
here.

SHAWN. Is it me to go near him, and he the wickedest and worst with me?
Let you take it, Pegeen Mike.

PEGEEN. Come on, so. [She goes forward with the others, and they drop
the double hitch over his head.]

CHRISTY. What ails you?

SHAWN -- [triumphantly, as they pull the rope tight on his arms.] --
Come on to the peelers, till they stretch you now.

CHRISTY. Me!

MICHAEL. If we took pity on you, the Lord God would, maybe, bring us
ruin from the law to-day, so you'd best come easy, for hanging is an
easy and a speedy end.

CHRISTY. I'll not stir. (To Pegeen.) And what is it you'll say to me,
and I after doing it this time in the face of all?

PEGEEN. I'll say, a strange man is a marvel, with his mighty talk; but
what's a squabble in your back-yard, and the blow of a loy, have taught
me that there's a great gap between a gallous story and a dirty deed.
(To Men.) Take him on from this, or the lot of us will be likely put on
trial for his deed to-day.

CHRISTY -- [with horror in his voice.] -- And it's yourself will send me
off, to have a horny-fingered hangman hitching his bloody slip-knots at
the butt of my ear.

MEN -- [pulling rope.] -- Come on, will you? [He is pulled down on the
floor.]

CHRISTY -- [twisting his legs round the table.] -- Cut the rope, Pegeen,
and I'll quit the lot of you, and live from this out, like the madmen of
Keel, eating muck and green weeds, on the faces of the cliffs.

PEGEEN. And leave us to hang, is it, for a saucy liar, the like of you?
(To men.) Take him on, out from this.

SHAWN. Pull a twist on his neck, and squeeze him so.

PHILLY. Twist yourself. Sure he cannot hurt you, if you keep your
distance from his teeth alone.

SHAWN. I'm afeard of him. (To Pegeen.) Lift a lighted sod, will you, and
scorch his leg.

PEGEEN -- [blowing the fire, with a bellows.] Leave go now, young
fellow, or I'll scorch your shins.

CHRISTY. You're blowing for to torture me (His voice rising and growing
stronger.) That's your kind, is it? Then let the lot of you be wary,
for, if I've to face the gallows, I'll have a gay march down, I tell
you, and shed the blood of some of you before I die.

SHAWN -- [in terror.] -- Keep a good hold, Philly. Be wary, for the love
of God. For I'm thinking he would liefest wreak his pains on me.

CHRISTY -- [almost gaily.] -- If I do lay my hands on you, it's the way
you'll be at the fall of night, hanging as a scarecrow for the fowls of
hell. Ah, you'll have a gallous jaunt I'm saying, coaching out through
Limbo with my father's ghost.

SHAWN -- [to Pegeen.] -- Make haste, will you? Oh, isn't he a holy
terror, and isn't it true for Father Reilly, that all drink's a curse
that has the lot of you so shaky and uncertain now?

CHRISTY. If I can wring a neck among you, I'll have a royal judgment
looking on the trembling jury in the courts of law. And won't there be
crying out in Mayo the day I'm stretched upon the rope with ladies in
their silks and satins snivelling in their lacy kerchiefs, and they
rhyming songs and ballads on the terror of my fate? [He squirms round on
the floor and bites Shawn's leg.]

SHAWN -- [shrieking.] My leg's bit on me. He's the like of a mad dog,
I'm thinking, the way that I will surely die.

CHRISTY -- [delighted with himself.] -- You will then, the way you can
shake out hell's flags of welcome for my coming in two weeks or three,
for I'm thinking Satan hasn't many have killed their da in Kerry, and
in Mayo too. [Old Mahon comes in behind on all fours and looks on
unnoticed.]

MEN -- [to Pegeen.] -- Bring the sod, will you?

PEGEEN [coming over.] -- God help him so. (Burns his leg.)

CHRISTY -- [kicking and screaming.] -- O, glory be to God! [He kicks
loose from the table, and they all drag him towards the door.]

JIMMY -- [seeing old Mahon.] -- Will you look what's come in? [They all
drop Christy and run left.]

CHRISTY -- [scrambling on his knees face to face with old Mahon.] -- Are
you coming to be killed a third time, or what ails you now?

MAHON. For what is it they have you tied?

CHRISTY. They're taking me to the peelers to have me hanged for slaying
you.

MICHAEL -- [apologetically.] It is the will of God that all should
guard their little cabins from the treachery of law, and what would my
daughter be doing if I was ruined or was hanged itself?

MAHON -- [grimly, loosening Christy.] -- It's little I care if you put a
bag on her back, and went picking cockles till the hour of death; but
my son and myself will be going our own way, and we'll have great times
from this out telling stories of the villainy of Mayo, and the fools is
here. (To Christy, who is freed.) Come on now.

CHRISTY. Go with you, is it? I will then, like a gallant captain with
his heathen slave. Go on now and I'll see you from this day stewing my
oatmeal and washing my spuds, for I'm master of all fights from now.
(Pushing Mahon.) Go on, I'm saying.

MAHON. Is it me?

CHRISTY. Not a word out of you. Go on from this.

MAHON [walking out and looking back at Christy over his shoulder.] --
Glory be to God! (With a broad smile.) I am crazy again! [Goes.]

CHRISTY. Ten thousand blessings upon all that's here, for you've turned
me a likely gaffer in the end of all, the way I'll go romancing through
a romping lifetime from this hour to the dawning of the judgment day.
[He goes out.]

MICHAEL. By the will of God, we'll have peace now for our drinks. Will
you draw the porter, Pegeen?

SHAWN -- [going up to her.] -- It's a miracle Father Reilly can wed us
in the end of all, and we'll have none to trouble us when his vicious
bite is healed.

PEGEEN -- [hitting him a box on the ear.] -- Quit my sight. (Putting
her shawl over her head and breaking out into wild lamentations.) Oh my
grief, I've lost him surely. I've lost the only Playboy of the Western
World.

PERSONS

     MAURYA (an old woman)......  Honor Lavelle

     BARTLEY (her son)..........  W. G. Fay

     CATHLEEN (her daughter)....  Sarah Allgood

     MEN AND WOMEN





SCENE.

--An Island off the West of Ireland. (Cottage kitchen, with nets,
oil-skins, spinning wheel, some new boards standing by the wall, etc.
Cathleen, a girl of about twenty, finishes kneading cake, and puts it
down in the pot-oven by the fire; then wipes her hands, and begins to
spin at the wheel. NORA, a young girl, puts her head in at the door.)


NORA [In a low voice.]

Where is she?

CATHLEEN She's lying down, God help her, and may be sleeping, if she's
able.

[Nora comes in softly, and takes a bundle from under her shawl.]

CATHLEEN [Spinning the wheel rapidly.]

What is it you have?

NORA The young priest is after bringing them. It's a shirt and a plain
stocking were got off a drowned man in Donegal.

[Cathleen stops her wheel with a sudden movement, and leans out to
listen.]

NORA We're to find out if it's Michael's they are, some time herself
will be down looking by the sea.

CATHLEEN How would they be Michael's, Nora. How would he go the length
of that way to the far north?

NORA The young priest says he's known the like of it. "If it's Michael's
they are," says he, "you can tell herself he's got a clean burial by the
grace of God, and if they're not his, let no one say a word about them,
for she'll be getting her death," says he, "with crying and lamenting."

[The door which Nora half closed is blown open by a gust of wind.]

CATHLEEN [Looking out anxiously.]

Did you ask him would he stop Bartley going this day with the horses to
the Galway fair?

NORA "I won't stop him," says he, "but let you not be afraid. Herself
does be saying prayers half through the night, and the Almighty God
won't leave her destitute," says he, "with no son living."

CATHLEEN Is the sea bad by the white rocks, Nora?

NORA Middling bad, God help us. There's a great roaring in the west, and
it's worse it'll be getting when the tide's turned to the wind.

[She goes over to the table with the bundle.]

Shall I open it now?

CATHLEEN Maybe she'd wake up on us, and come in before we'd done.

[Coming to the table.]

It's a long time we'll be, and the two of us crying.

NORA [Goes to the inner door and listens.]

She's moving about on the bed. She'll be coming in a minute.

CATHLEEN Give me the ladder, and I'll put them up in the turf-loft, the
way she won't know of them at all, and maybe when the tide turns she'll
be going down to see would he be floating from the east.

[They put the ladder against the gable of the chimney; Cathleen goes up
a few steps and hides the bundle in the turf-loft. Maurya comes from the
inner room.]

MAURYA [Looking up at Cathleen and speaking querulously.]

Isn't it turf enough you have for this day and evening?

CATHLEEN There's a cake baking at the fire for a short space. [Throwing
down the turf] and Bartley will want it when the tide turns if he goes
to Connemara.

[Nora picks up the turf and puts it round the pot-oven.]

MAURYA [Sitting down on a stool at the fire.]

He won't go this day with the wind rising from the south and west. He
won't go this day, for the young priest will stop him surely.

NORA He'll not stop him, mother, and I heard Eamon Simon and Stephen
Pheety and Colum Shawn saying he would go.

MAURYA Where is he itself?

NORA He went down to see would there be another boat sailing in the
week, and I'm thinking it won't be long till he's here now, for the
tide's turning at the green head, and the hooker' tacking from the east.

CATHLEEN I hear some one passing the big stones.

NORA [Looking out.]

He's coming now, and he's in a hurry.

BARTLEY [Comes in and looks round the room. Speaking sadly and quietly.]

Where is the bit of new rope, Cathleen, was bought in Connemara?

CATHLEEN [Coming down.]

Give it to him, Nora; it's on a nail by the white boards. I hung it up
this morning, for the pig with the black feet was eating it.

NORA [Giving him a rope.]

Is that it, Bartley?

MAURYA You'd do right to leave that rope, Bartley, hanging by the boards
[Bartley takes the rope]. It will be wanting in this place, I'm telling
you, if Michael is washed up to-morrow morning, or the next morning,
or any morning in the week, for it's a deep grave we'll make him by the
grace of God.

BARTLEY [Beginning to work with the rope.]

I've no halter the way I can ride down on the mare, and I must go now
quickly. This is the one boat going for two weeks or beyond it, and the
fair will be a good fair for horses I heard them saying below.

MAURYA It's a hard thing they'll be saying below if the body is washed
up and there's no man in it to make the coffin, and I after giving a big
price for the finest white boards you'd find in Connemara.

[She looks round at the boards.]

BARTLEY How would it be washed up, and we after looking each day for
nine days, and a strong wind blowing a while back from the west and
south?

MAURYA If it wasn't found itself, that wind is raising the sea, and
there was a star up against the moon, and it rising in the night. If it
was a hundred horses, or a thousand horses you had itself, what is the
price of a thousand horses against a son where there is one son only?

BARTLEY [Working at the halter, to Cathleen.]

Let you go down each day, and see the sheep aren't jumping in on the
rye, and if the jobber comes you can sell the pig with the black feet if
there is a good price going.

MAURYA How would the like of her get a good price for a pig?

BARTLEY [To Cathleen]

If the west wind holds with the last bit of the moon let you and Nora
get up weed enough for another cock for the kelp. It's hard set we'll be
from this day with no one in it but one man to work.

MAURYA It's hard set we'll be surely the day you're drownd'd with the
rest. What way will I live and the girls with me, and I an old woman
looking for the grave?

[Bartley lays down the halter, takes off his old coat, and puts on a
newer one of the same flannel.]

BARTLEY [To Nora.]

Is she coming to the pier?

NORA [Looking out.] She's passing the green head and letting fall her
sails.

BARTLEY [Getting his purse and tobacco.]

I'll have half an hour to go down, and you'll see me coming again in two
days, or in three days, or maybe in four days if the wind is bad.

MAURYA [Turning round to the fire, and putting her shawl over her head.]

Isn't it a hard and cruel man won't hear a word from an old woman, and
she holding him from the sea?

CATHLEEN It's the life of a young man to be going on the sea, and who
would listen to an old woman with one thing and she saying it over?

BARTLEY [Taking the halter.]

I must go now quickly. I'll ride down on the red mare, and the gray
pony'll run behind me. . . The blessing of God on you.

[He goes out.]

MAURYA [Crying out as he is in the door.]

He's gone now, God spare us, and we'll not see him again. He's gone
now, and when the black night is falling I'll have no son left me in the
world.

CATHLEEN Why wouldn't you give him your blessing and he looking round in
the door? Isn't it sorrow enough is on every one in this house without
your sending him out with an unlucky word behind him, and a hard word in
his ear?

[Maurya takes up the tongs and begins raking the fire aimlessly without
looking round.]

NORA [Turning towards her.]

You're taking away the turf from the cake.

CATHLEEN [Crying out.]

The Son of God forgive us, Nora, we're after forgetting his bit of
bread.

[She comes over to the fire.]

NORA And it's destroyed he'll be going till dark night, and he after
eating nothing since the sun went up.

CATHLEEN [Turning the cake out of the oven.]

It's destroyed he'll be, surely. There's no sense left on any person in
a house where an old woman will be talking for ever.

[Maurya sways herself on her stool.]

CATHLEEN [Cutting off some of the bread and rolling it in a cloth; to
Maurya.]

Let you go down now to the spring well and give him this and he passing.
You'll see him then and the dark word will be broken, and you can say
"God speed you," the way he'll be easy in his mind.

MAURYA [Taking the bread.]

Will I be in it as soon as himself?

CATHLEEN If you go now quickly.

MAURYA [Standing up unsteadily.]

It's hard set I am to walk.

CATHLEEN [Looking at her anxiously.]

Give her the stick, Nora, or maybe she'll slip on the big stones.

NORA What stick?

CATHLEEN The stick Michael brought from Connemara.

MAURYA [Taking a stick Nora gives her.]

In the big world the old people do be leaving things after them for
their sons and children, but in this place it is the young men do be
leaving things behind for them that do be old.

[She goes out slowly. Nora goes over to the ladder.]

CATHLEEN Wait, Nora, maybe she'd turn back quickly. She's that sorry,
God help her, you wouldn't know the thing she'd do.

NORA Is she gone round by the bush?

CATHLEEN [Looking out.]

She's gone now. Throw it down quickly, for the Lord knows when she'll be
out of it again.

NORA [Getting the bundle from the loft.]

The young priest said he'd be passing to-morrow, and we might go down
and speak to him below if it's Michael's they are surely.

CATHLEEN [Taking the bundle.]

Did he say what way they were found?

NORA [Coming down.]

"There were two men," says he, "and they rowing round with poteen before
the cocks crowed, and the oar of one of them caught the body, and they
passing the black cliffs of the north."

CATHLEEN [Trying to open the bundle.]

Give me a knife, Nora, the string's perished with the salt water, and
there's a black knot on it you wouldn't loosen in a week.

NORA [Giving her a knife.]

I've heard tell it was a long way to Donegal.

CATHLEEN [Cutting the string.]

It is surely. There was a man in here a while ago--the man sold us that
knife--and he said if you set off walking from the rocks beyond, it
would be seven days you'd be in Donegal.

NORA And what time would a man take, and he floating?

[Cathleen opens the bundle and takes out a bit of a stocking. They look
at them eagerly.]

CATHLEEN [In a low voice.]

The Lord spare us, Nora! isn't it a queer hard thing to say if it's his
they are surely?

NORA I'll get his shirt off the hook the way we can put the one flannel
on the other [she looks through some clothes hanging in the corner.]
It's not with them, Cathleen, and where will it be?

CATHLEEN I'm thinking Bartley put it on him in the morning, for his own
shirt was heavy with the salt in it [pointing to the corner]. There's a
bit of a sleeve was of the same stuff. Give me that and it will do.

[Nora brings it to her and they compare the flannel.]

CATHLEEN It's the same stuff, Nora; but if it is itself aren't there
great rolls of it in the shops of Galway, and isn't it many another man
may have a shirt of it as well as Michael himself?

NORA [Who has taken up the stocking and counted the stitches, crying
out.]

It's Michael, Cathleen, it's Michael; God spare his soul, and what will
herself say when she hears this story, and Bartley on the sea?

CATHLEEN [Taking the stocking.]

It's a plain stocking.

NORA It's the second one of the third pair I knitted, and I put up three
score stitches, and I dropped four of them.

CATHLEEN [Counts the stitches.]

It's that number is in it [crying out.] Ah, Nora, isn't it a bitter
thing to think of him floating that way to the far north, and no one to
keen him but the black hags that do be flying on the sea?

NORA [Swinging herself round, and throwing out her arms on the clothes.]

And isn't it a pitiful thing when there is nothing left of a man who
was a great rower and fisher, but a bit of an old shirt and a plain
stocking?

CATHLEEN [After an instant.]

Tell me is herself coming, Nora? I hear a little sound on the path.

NORA [Looking out.]

She is, Cathleen. She's coming up to the door.

CATHLEEN Put these things away before she'll come in. Maybe it's easier
she'll be after giving her blessing to Bartley, and we won't let on
we've heard anything the time he's on the sea.

NORA [Helping Cathleen to close the bundle.]

We'll put them here in the corner.

[They put them into a hole in the chimney corner. Cathleen goes back to
the spinning-wheel.]

NORA Will she see it was crying I was?

CATHLEEN Keep your back to the door the way the light'll not be on you.

[Nora sits down at the chimney corner, with her back to the door. Maurya
comes in very slowly, without looking at the girls, and goes over to her
stool at the other side of the fire. The cloth with the bread is still
in her hand. The girls look at each other, and Nora points to the bundle
of bread.]

CATHLEEN [After spinning for a moment.]

You didn't give him his bit of bread?

[Maurya begins to keen softly, without turning round.]

CATHLEEN Did you see him riding down?

[Maurya goes on keening.]

CATHLEEN [A little impatiently.]

God forgive you; isn't it a better thing to raise your voice and tell
what you seen, than to be making lamentation for a thing that's done?
Did you see Bartley, I'm saying to you?

MAURYA [With a weak voice.]

My heart's broken from this day.

CATHLEEN [As before.]

Did you see Bartley?

MAURYA I seen the fearfulest thing.

CATHLEEN [Leaves her wheel and looks out.]

God forgive you; he's riding the mare now over the green head, and the
gray pony behind him.

MAURYA [Starts, so that her shawl falls back from her head and shows her
white tossed hair. With a frightened voice.]

The gray pony behind him.

CATHLEEN [Coming to the fire.]

What is it ails you, at all?

MAURYA [Speaking very slowly.]

I've seen the fearfulest thing any person has seen, since the day Bride
Dara seen the dead man with the child in his arms.

CATHLEEN AND NORA UAH.

[They crouch down in front of the old woman at the fire.]

NORA Tell us what it is you seen.

MAURYA I went down to the spring well, and I stood there saying a prayer
to myself. Then Bartley came along, and he riding on the red mare with
the gray pony behind him [she puts up her hands, as if to hide something
from her eyes.] The Son of God spare us, Nora!

CATHLEEN What is it you seen.

MAURYA I seen Michael himself.

CATHLEEN [Speaking softly.]

You did not, mother; it wasn't Michael you seen, for his body is after
being found in the far north, and he's got a clean burial by the grace
of God.

MAURYA [A little defiantly.]

I'm after seeing him this day, and he riding and galloping. Bartley came
first on the red mare; and I tried to say "God speed you," but something
choked the words in my throat. He went by quickly; and "the blessing of
God on you," says he, and I could say nothing. I looked up then, and
I crying, at the gray pony, and there was Michael upon it--with fine
clothes on him, and new shoes on his feet.

CATHLEEN [Begins to keen.]

It's destroyed we are from this day. It's destroyed, surely.

NORA Didn't the young priest say the Almighty God wouldn't leave her
destitute with no son living?

MAURYA [In a low voice, but clearly.]

It's little the like of him knows of the sea. . . . Bartley will be
lost now, and let you call in Eamon and make me a good coffin out of
the white boards, for I won't live after them. I've had a husband, and
a husband's father, and six sons in this house--six fine men, though
it was a hard birth I had with every one of them and they coming to the
world--and some of them were found and some of them were not found, but
they're gone now the lot of them. . . There were Stephen, and Shawn,
were lost in the great wind, and found after in the Bay of Gregory of
the Golden Mouth, and carried up the two of them on the one plank, and
in by that door.

[She pauses for a moment, the girls start as if they heard something
through the door that is half open behind them.]

NORA [In a whisper.]

Did you hear that, Cathleen? Did you hear a noise in the north-east?

CATHLEEN [In a whisper.]

There's some one after crying out by the seashore.

MAURYA [Continues without hearing anything.]

There was Sheamus and his father, and his own father again, were lost in
a dark night, and not a stick or sign was seen of them when the sun went
up. There was Patch after was drowned out of a curagh that turned over.
I was sitting here with Bartley, and he a baby, lying on my two knees,
and I seen two women, and three women, and four women coming in, and
they crossing themselves, and not saying a word. I looked out then, and
there were men coming after them, and they holding a thing in the half
of a red sail, and water dripping out of it--it was a dry day, Nora--and
leaving a track to the door.

[She pauses again with her hand stretched out towards the door. It
opens softly and old women begin to come in, crossing themselves on the
threshold, and kneeling down in front of the stage with red petticoats
over their heads.]

MAURYA [Half in a dream, to Cathleen.]

Is it Patch, or Michael, or what is it at all?

CATHLEEN Michael is after being found in the far north, and when he is
found there how could he be here in this place?

MAURYA There does be a power of young men floating round in the sea, and
what way would they know if it was Michael they had, or another man like
him, for when a man is nine days in the sea, and the wind blowing, it's
hard set his own mother would be to say what man was it.

CATHLEEN It's Michael, God spare him, for they're after sending us a bit
of his clothes from the far north.

[She reaches out and hands Maurya the clothes that belonged to Michael.
Maurya stands up slowly, and takes them into her hands. NORA looks out.]

NORA They're carrying a thing among them and there's water dripping out
of it and leaving a track by the big stones.

CATHLEEN [In a whisper to the women who have come in.]

Is it Bartley it is?

ONE OF THE WOMEN It is surely, God rest his soul.

[Two younger women come in and pull out the table. Then men carry in the
body of Bartley, laid on a plank, with a bit of a sail over it, and lay
it on the table.]

CATHLEEN [To the women, as they are doing so.]

What way was he drowned?

ONE OF THE WOMEN The gray pony knocked him into the sea, and he was
washed out where there is a great surf on the white rocks.

[Maurya has gone over and knelt down at the head of the table. The women
are keening softly and swaying themselves with a slow movement. Cathleen
and Nora kneel at the other end of the table. The men kneel near the
door.]

MAURYA [Raising her head and speaking as if she did not see the people
around her.]

They're all gone now, and there isn't anything more the sea can do to
me.... I'll have no call now to be up crying and praying when the wind
breaks from the south, and you can hear the surf is in the east, and the
surf is in the west, making a great stir with the two noises, and they
hitting one on the other. I'll have no call now to be going down and
getting Holy Water in the dark nights after Samhain, and I won't care
what way the sea is when the other women will be keening. [To Nora]. Give
me the Holy Water, Nora, there's a small sup still on the dresser.

[Nora gives it to her.]

MAURYA [Drops Michael's clothes across Bartley's feet, and sprinkles the
Holy Water over him.]

It isn't that I haven't prayed for you, Bartley, to the Almighty God.
It isn't that I haven't said prayers in the dark night till you wouldn't
know what I'ld be saying; but it's a great rest I'll have now, and it's
time surely. It's a great rest I'll have now, and great sleeping in the
long nights after Samhain, if it's only a bit of wet flour we do have to
eat, and maybe a fish that would be stinking.

[She kneels down again, crossing herself, and saying prayers under her
breath.]

CATHLEEN [To an old man.]

Maybe yourself and Eamon would make a coffin when the sun rises. We have
fine white boards herself bought, God help her, thinking Michael would
be found, and I have a new cake you can eat while you'll be working.

THE OLD MAN [Looking at the boards.]

Are there nails with them?

CATHLEEN There are not, Colum; we didn't think of the nails.

ANOTHER MAN It's a great wonder she wouldn't think of the nails, and all
the coffins she's seen made already.

CATHLEEN It's getting old she is, and broken.

[Maurya stands up again very slowly and spreads out the pieces of
Michael's clothes beside the body, sprinkling them with the last of the
Holy Water.]

NORA [In a whisper to Cathleen.]

She's quiet now and easy; but the day Michael was drowned you could
hear her crying out from this to the spring well. It's fonder she was of
Michael, and would any one have thought that?

CATHLEEN [Slowly and clearly.]

An old woman will be soon tired with anything she will do, and isn't it
nine days herself is after crying and keening, and making great sorrow
in the house?

MAURYA [Puts the empty cup mouth downwards on the table, and lays her
hands together on Bartley's feet.]

They're all together this time, and the end is come. May the Almighty
God have mercy on Bartley's soul, and on Michael's soul, and on the
souls of Sheamus and Patch, and Stephen and Shawn (bending her head]);
and may He have mercy on my soul, Nora, and on the soul of every one is
left living in the world.

[She pauses, and the keen rises a little more loudly from the women,
then sinks away.]

MAURYA [Continuing.]

Michael has a clean burial in the far north, by the grace of the
Almighty God. Bartley will have a fine coffin out of the white boards,
and a deep grave surely. What more can we want than that? No man at all
can be living for ever, and we must be satisfied.

﻿THE TINKER’S WEDDING

PERSONS

MICHAEL BYRNE, a tinker.
MARY BYRNE, an old woman, his mother.
SARAH CASEY, a young tinker woman.
A PRIEST.



ACT I.

SCENE: _A Village roadside after nightfall. A fire of sticks is burning
near the ditch a little to the right. Michael is working beside it. In
the background, on the left, a sort of tent and ragged clothes drying
on the hedge. On the right a chapel-gate._


SARAH CASEY
_coming in on right, eagerly._—We’ll see his reverence this place,
Michael Byrne, and he passing backward to his house to-night.

MICHAEL
_grimly._—That’ll be a sacred and a sainted joy!

SARAH
_sharply._—It’ll be small joy for yourself if you aren’t ready with my
wedding ring. _(She goes over to him.)_ Is it near done this time, or
what way is it at all?

MICHAEL
A poor way only, Sarah Casey, for it’s the divil’s job making a ring,
and you’ll be having my hands destroyed in a short while the way I’ll
not be able to make a tin can at all maybe at the dawn of day.

SARAH
_sitting down beside him and throwing sticks on the fire._—If it’s the
divil’s job, let you mind it, and leave your speeches that would choke
a fool.

MICHAEL
_slowly and glumly._—And it’s you’ll go talking of fools, Sarah Casey,
when no man did ever hear a lying story even of your like unto this
mortal day. You to be going beside me a great while, and rearing a lot
of them, and then to be setting off with your talk of getting married,
and your driving me to it, and I not asking it at all.

[_Sarah turns her back to him and arranges something in the ditch._

MICHAEL
_angrily._—Can’t you speak a word when I’m asking what is it ails you
since the moon did change?

SARAH
_musingly._—I’m thinking there isn’t anything ails me, Michael Byrne;
but the spring-time is a queer time, and it’s queer thoughts maybe I do
think at whiles.

MICHAEL
It’s hard set you’d be to think queerer than welcome, Sarah Casey; but
what will you gain dragging me to the priest this night, I’m saying,
when it’s new thoughts you’ll be thinking at the dawn of day?

SARAH
_teasingly._—It’s at the dawn of day I do be thinking I’d have a right
to be going off to the rich tinkers do be travelling from Tibradden to
the Tara Hill; for it’d be a fine life to be driving with young
Jaunting Jim, where there wouldn’t be any big hills to break the back
of you, with walking up and walking down.

MICHAEL
_with dismay._—It’s the like of that you do be thinking!

SARAH
The like of that, Michael Byrne, when there is a bit of sun in it, and
a kind air, and a great smell coming from the thorn-trees is above your
head.

MICHAEL
_looks at her for a moment with horror, and then hands her the
ring._—Will that fit you now?

SARAH
_trying it on._—It’s making it tight you are, and the edges sharp on
the tin.

MICHAEL
_looking at it carefully._—It’s the fat of your own finger, Sarah
Casey; and isn’t it a mad thing I’m saying again that you’d be asking
marriage of me, or making a talk of going away from me, and you
thriving and getting your good health by the grace of the Almighty God?

SARAH
_giving it back to him._—Fix it now, and it’ll do, if you’re wary you
don’t squeeze it again.

MICHAEL
_moodily, working again._—It’s easy saying be wary; there’s many things
easy said, Sarah Casey, you’d wonder a fool even would be saying at
all. _(He starts violently.)_ The divil mend you, I’m scalded again!

SARAH
_scornfully._—If you are, it’s a clumsy man you are this night, Michael
Byrne _(raising her voice)_; and let you make haste now, or herself
will be coming with the porter.

MICHAEL
_defiantly, raising his voice._—Let me make haste? I’ll be making haste
maybe to hit you a great clout; for I’m thinking on the day I got you
above at Rathvanna, and the way you began crying out and saying, “I’ll
go back to my ma,” and I’m thinking on the way I came behind you that
time, and hit you a great clout in the lug, and how quiet and easy it
was you came along with me from that hour to this present day.

SARAH
_standing up and throwing all her sticks into the fire._—And a big fool
I was too, maybe; but we’ll be seeing Jaunting Jim to-morrow in
Ballinaclash, and he after getting a great price for his white foal in
the horse-fair of Wicklow, the way it’ll be a great sight to see him
squandering his share of gold, and he with a grand eye for a fine
horse, and a grand eye for a woman.

MICHAEL
_working again with impatience._—The divil do him good with the two of
them.

SARAH
_kicking up the ashes with her foot._—Ah, he’s a great lad, I’m telling
you, and it’s proud and happy I’ll be to see him, and he the first one
called me the Beauty of Ballinacree, a fine name for a woman.

MICHAEL
_with contempt._—It’s the like of that name they do be putting on the
horses they have below racing in Arklow. It’s easy pleased you are,
Sarah Casey, easy pleased with a big word, or the liar speaks it.

SARAH
Liar!

MICHAEL
Liar, surely.

SARAH
_indignantly._—Liar, is it? Didn’t you ever hear tell of the peelers
followed me ten miles along the Glen Malure, and they talking love to
me in the dark night, or of the children you’ll meet coming from school
and they saying one to the other, “It’s this day we seen Sarah Casey,
the Beauty of Ballinacree, a great sight surely.”

MICHAEL
God help the lot of them!

SARAH
It’s yourself you’ll be calling God to help, in two weeks or three,
when you’ll be waking up in the dark night and thinking you see me
coming with the sun on me, and I driving a high cart with Jaunting Jim
going behind. It’s lonesome and cold you’ll be feeling the ditch where
you’ll be lying down that night, I’m telling you, and you hearing the
old woman making a great noise in her sleep, and the bats squeaking in
the trees.

MICHAEL
Whist. I hear some one coming the road.

SARAH
_looking out right._—It’s some one coming forward from the doctor’s
door.

MICHAEL
It’s often his reverence does be in there playing cards, or drinking a
sup, or singing songs, until the dawn of day.

SARAH
It’s a big boast of a man with a long step on him and a trumpeting
voice. It’s his reverence surely; and if you have the ring done, it’s a
great bargain we’ll make now and he after drinking his glass.

MICHAEL
_going to her and giving her the ring._—There’s your ring, Sarah Casey;
but I’m thinking he’ll walk by and not stop to speak with the like of
us at all.

SARAH
_tidying herself, in great excitement._—Let you be sitting here and
keeping a great blaze, the way he can look on my face; and let you seem
to be working, for it’s great love the like of him have to talk of
work.

MICHAEL
_moodily, sitting down and_ _beginning to work at a tin can._—Great
love surely.

SARAH
_eagerly._—Make a great blaze now, Michael Byrne.

[_The priest comes in on right; she comes forward in front of him._

SARAH
_in a very plausible voice._—Good evening, your reverence. It’s a grand
fine night, by the grace of God.

PRIEST
The Lord have mercy on us! What kind of a living woman is it that you
are at all?

SARAH
It’s Sarah Casey I am, your reverence, the Beauty of Ballinacree, and
it’s Michael Byrne is below in the ditch.

PRIEST
A holy pair, surely! Let you get out of my way.

[_He tries to pass by._

SARAH
_keeping in front of him._—We are wanting a little word with your
reverence.

PRIEST
I haven’t a halfpenny at all. Leave the road I’m saying.

SARAH
It isn’t a halfpenny we’re asking, holy father; but we were thinking
maybe we’d have a right to be getting married; and we were thinking
it’s yourself would marry us for not a halfpenny at all; for you’re a
kind man, your reverence, a kind man with the poor.

PRIEST
_with astonishment._—Is it marry you for nothing at all?

SARAH
It is, your reverence; and we were thinking maybe you’d give us a
little small bit of silver to pay for the ring.

PRIEST
_loudly._—Let you hold your tongue; let you be quiet, Sarah Casey. I’ve
no silver at all for the like of you; and if you want to be married,
let you pay your pound. I’d do it for a pound only, and that’s making
it a sight cheaper than I’d make it for one of my own pairs is living
here in the place.

SARAH
Where would the like of us get a pound, your reverence?

PRIEST
Wouldn’t you easy get it with your selling asses, and making cans, and
your stealing east and west in Wicklow and Wexford and the county
Meath? _(He tries to pass her.)_ Let you leave the road, and not be
plaguing me more.

SARAH
_pleadingly, taking money from her pocket._—Wouldn’t you have a little
mercy on us, your reverence? _(Holding out money.)_ Wouldn’t you marry
us for a half a sovereign, and it a nice shiny one with a view on it of
the living king’s mamma?

PRIEST
If it’s ten shillings you have, let you get ten more the same way, and
I’ll marry you then.

SARAH
_whining._—It’s two years we are getting that bit, your reverence, with
our pence and our halfpence and an odd three-penny bit; and if you
don’t marry us now, himself and the old woman, who has a great drouth,
will be drinking it to-morrow in the fair _(she puts her apron to her
eyes, half sobbing)_, and then I won’t be married any time, and I’ll be
saying till I’m an old woman: “It’s a cruel and a wicked thing to be
bred poor.”

PRIEST
_turning up towards the fire._—Let you not be crying, Sarah Casey. It’s
a queer woman you are to be crying at the like of that, and you your
whole life walking the roads.

SARAH
_sobbing._—It’s two years we are getting the gold, your reverence, and
now you won’t marry us for that bit, and we hard-working poor people do
be making cans in the dark night, and blinding our eyes with the black
smoke from the bits of twigs we do be burning.

[_An old woman is heard singing tipsily on the left._

PRIEST
_looking at the can Michael is making._—When will you have that can
done, Michael Byrne?

MICHAEL
In a short space only, your reverence, for I’m putting the last dab of
solder on the rim.

PRIEST
Let you get a crown along with the ten shillings and the gallon can,
Sarah Casey, and I will wed you so.

MARY
_suddenly shouting behind, tipsily._—Larry was a fine lad, I’m saying;
Larry was a fine lad, Sarah Casey—

MICHAEL
Whist, now, the two of you. There’s my mother coming, and she’d have us
destroyed if she heard the like of that talk the time she’s been
drinking her fill.

MARY
_comes in singing_

    And when we asked him what way he’d die,
        And he hanging unrepented,
    “Begob,” says Larry, “that’s all in my eye,
        By the clergy first invented.”

SARAH
Give me the jug now, or you’ll have it spilt in the ditch.

MARY
_holding the jug with both her hands, in a stilted voice._—Let you
leave me easy, Sarah Casey. I won’t spill it, I’m saying. God help you;
are you thinking it’s frothing full to the brim it is at this hour of
the night, and I after carrying it in my two hands a long step from
Jemmy Neill’s?

MICHAEL
_anxiously._—Is there a sup left at all?

SARAH
_looking into the jug._—A little small sup only I’m thinking.

MARY
_sees the priest, and holds out jug towards him._—God save your
reverence. I’m after bringing down a smart drop; and let you drink it
up now, for it’s a middling drouthy man you are at all times, God
forgive you, and this night is cruel dry.

[_She tries to go towards him. Sarah holds her back._

PRIEST
_waving her away._—Let you not be falling to the flames. Keep off, I’m
saying.

MARY
_persuasively._—Let you not be shy of us, your reverence. Aren’t we all
sinners, God help us! Drink a sup now, I’m telling you; and we won’t
let on a word about it till the Judgment Day.

[_She takes up a tin mug, pours some porter into it, and gives it to
him._

MARY
_singing, and holding the jug in her hand._

    A lonesome ditch in Ballygan
    The day you’re beating a tenpenny can;
    A lonesome bank in Ballyduff
    The time . . .

[_She breaks off._ It’s a bad, wicked song, Sarah Casey; and let you
put me down now in the ditch, and I won’t sing it till himself will be
gone; for it’s bad enough he is, I’m thinking, without ourselves making
him worse.

SARAH
_putting her down, to the priest, half laughing._—Don’t mind her at
all, your reverence. She’s no shame the time she’s a drop taken; and if
it was the Holy Father from Rome was in it, she’d give him a little sup
out of her mug, and say the same as she’d say to yourself.

MARY
_to the priest._—Let you drink it up, holy father. Let you drink it up,
I’m saying, and not be letting on you wouldn’t do the like of it, and
you with a stack of pint bottles above, reaching the sky.

PRIEST
_with resignation._—Well, here’s to your good health, and God forgive
us all.

[_He drinks._

MARY
That’s right now, your reverence, and the blessing of God be on you.
Isn’t it a grand thing to see you sitting down, with no pride in you,
and drinking a sup with the like of us, and we the poorest, wretched,
starving creatures you’d see any place on the earth?

PRIEST
If it’s starving you are itself, I’m thinking it’s well for the like of
you that do be drinking when there’s drouth on you, and lying down to
sleep when your legs are stiff. _(He sighs gloomily.)_ What would you
do if it was the like of myself you were, saying Mass with your mouth
dry, and running east and west for a sick call maybe, and hearing the
rural people again and they saying their sins?

MARY
_with compassion._—It’s destroyed you must be hearing the sins of the
rural people on a fine spring.

PRIEST
_with despondency._—It’s a hard life, I’m telling you, a hard life,
Mary Byrne; and there’s the bishop coming in the morning, and he an old
man, would have you destroyed if he seen a thing at all.

MARY
_with great sympathy._—It’d break my heart to hear you talking and
sighing the like of that, your reverence. _(She pats him on the knee.)_
Let you rouse up, now, if it’s a poor, single man you are itself, and
I’ll be singing you songs unto the dawn of day.

PRIEST
_interrupting her._—What is it I want with your songs when it’d be
better for the like of you, that’ll soon die, to be down on your two
knees saying prayers to the Almighty God?

MARY
If it’s prayers I want, you’d have a right to say one yourself, holy
father; for we don’t have them at all, and I’ve heard tell a power of
times it’s that you’re for. Say one now, your reverence, for I’ve heard
a power of queer things and I walking the world, but there’s one thing
I never heard any time, and that’s a real priest saying a prayer.

PRIEST
The Lord protect us!

MARY
It’s no lie, holy father. I often heard the rural people making a queer
noise and they going to rest; but who’d mind the like of them? And I’m
thinking it should be great game to hear a scholar, the like of you,
speaking Latin to the saints above.

PRIEST
_scandalized._—Stop your talking, Mary Byrne; you’re an old flagrant
heathen, and I’ll stay no more with the lot of you.

[_He rises._

MARY
_catching hold of him._—Stop till you say a prayer, your reverence;
stop till you say a little prayer, I’m telling you, and I’ll give you
my blessing and the last sup from the jug.

PRIEST
_breaking away._—Leave me go, Mary Byrne; for I have never met your
like for hard abominations the score and two years I’m living in the
place.

MARY
_innocently._—Is that the truth?

PRIEST
—It is, then, and God have mercy on your soul.

[_The priest goes towards the left, and Sarah follows him._

SARAH
_in a low voice._—And what time will you do the thing I’m asking, holy
father? for I’m thinking you’ll do it surely, and not have me growing
into an old wicked heathen like herself.

MARY
_calling out shrilly._—Let you be walking back here, Sarah Casey, and
not be talking whisper-talk with the like of him in the face of the
Almighty God.

SARAH
_to the priest._—Do you hear her now, your reverence? Isn’t it true,
surely, she’s an old, flagrant heathen, would destroy the world?

PRIEST
_to Sarah, moving off._—Well, I’ll be coming down early to the chapel,
and let you come to me a while after you see me passing, and bring the
bit of gold along with you, and the tin can. I’ll marry you for them
two, though it’s a pitiful small sum; for I wouldn’t be easy in my soul
if I left you growing into an old, wicked heathen the like of her.

SARAH
_following him out._—The blessing of the Almighty God be on you, holy
father, and that He may reward and watch you from this present day.

MARY
_nudging Michael._—Did you see that, Michael Byrne? Didn’t you hear me
telling you she’s flighty a while back since the change of the moon?
With her fussing for marriage, and she making whisper-talk with one man
or another man along by the road.

MICHAEL
—Whist now, or she’ll knock the head of you the time she comes back.

MARY
—Ah, it’s a bad, wicked way the world is this night, if there’s a fine
air in it itself. You’d never have seen me, and I a young woman, making
whisper-talk with the like of him, and he the fearfullest old fellow
you’d see any place walking the world.

[_Sarah comes back quickly._

MARY
_calling out to her._—What is it you’re after whispering above with
himself?

SARAH
_exultingly._—Lie down, and leave us in peace. _She whispers with
Michael._

MARY
_poking out her pipe with a straw, sings_—

    She’d whisper with one, and she’d whisper with two—

_She breaks off coughing._—My singing voice is gone for this night,
Sarah Casey. _(She lights her pipe.)_ But if it’s flighty you are
itself, you’re a grand handsome woman, the glory of tinkers, the pride
of Wicklow, the Beauty of Ballinacree. I wouldn’t have you lying down
and you lonesome to sleep this night in a dark ditch when the spring is
coming in the trees; so let you sit down there by the big bough, and
I’ll be telling you the finest story you’d hear any place from Dundalk
to Ballinacree, with great queens in it, making themselves matches from
the start to the end, and they with shiny silks on them the length of
the day, and white shifts for the night.

MICHAEL
_standing up with the tin can in his hand._—Let you go asleep, and not
have us destroyed.

MARY
_lying back sleepily._—Don’t mind him, Sarah Casey. Sit down now, and
I’ll be telling you a story would be fit to tell a woman the like of
you in the springtime of the year.

SARAH
_taking the can from Michael, and tying it up in a piece of
sacking._—That’ll not be rusting now in the dews of night. I’ll put it
up in the ditch the way it will be handy in the morning; and now we’ve
that done, Michael Byrne, I’ll go along with you and welcome for Tim
Flaherty’s hens.

_[She puts the can in the ditch._

MARY
_sleepily._—I’ve a grand story of the great queens of Ireland with
white necks on them the like of Sarah Casey, and fine arms would hit
you a slap the way Sarah Casey would hit you.

SARAH
_beckoning on the left._—Come along now, Michael, while she’s falling
asleep.

[_He goes towards left. Mary sees that they are going, starts up
suddenly, and turns over on her hands and knees._

MARY
_piteously._—Where is it you’re going? Let you walk back here, and not
be leaving me lonesome when the night is fine.

SARAH
Don’t be waking the world with your talk when we’re going up through
the back wood to get two of Tim Flaherty’s hens are roosting in the
ash-tree above at the well.

MARY
And it’s leaving me lone you are? Come back here, Sarah Casey. Come
back here, I’m saying; or if it’s off you must go, leave me the two
little coppers you have, the way I can walk up in a short while, and
get another pint for my sleep.

SARAH
It’s too much you have taken. Let you stretch yourself out and take a
long sleep; for isn’t that the best thing any woman can do, and she an
old drinking heathen like yourself.

[_She and Michael go out left._

MARY
_standing up slowly._—It’s gone they are, and I with my feet that weak
under me you’d knock me down with a rush, and my head with a noise in
it the like of what you’d hear in a stream and it running between two
rocks and rain falling. _(She goes over to the ditch where the can is
tied in sacking, and takes it down.)_ What good am I this night, God
help me? What good are the grand stories I have when it’s few would
listen to an old woman, few but a girl maybe would be in great fear the
time her hour was come, or a little child wouldn’t be sleeping with the
hunger on a cold night? _(She takes the can from the sacking and fits
in three empty bottles and straw in its place, and ties them up.)_
Maybe the two of them have a good right to be walking out the little
short while they’d be young; but if they have itself, they’ll not keep
Mary Byrne from her full pint when the night’s fine, and there’s a dry
moon in the sky. _(She takes up the can, and puts the package back in
the ditch.)_ Jemmy Neill’s a decent lad; and he’ll give me a good drop
for the can; and maybe if I keep near the peelers to-morrow for the
first bit of the fair, herself won’t strike me at all; and if she does
itself, what’s a little stroke on your head beside sitting lonesome on
a fine night, hearing the dogs barking, and the bats squeaking, and you
saying over, it’s a short while only till you die.

[_She goes out singing “The night before Larry was stretched.”_

CURTAIN



ACT II.

SCENE: _The same. Early morning. Sarah is washing her face in an old
bucket; then plaits her hair. Michael is tidying himself also. Mary
Byrne is asleep against the ditch._



SARAH
_to Michael, with pleased excitement._—Go over, now, to the bundle
beyond, and you’ll find a kind of a red handkerchief to put upon your
neck, and a green one for myself.

MICHAEL
_getting them._—You’re after spending more money on the like of them.
Well, it’s a power we’re losing this time, and we not gaining a thing
at all. _(With the handkerchief.)_ Is it them two?

SARAH
It is, Michael. _(She takes one of them.)_ Let you tackle that one
round under your chin; and let you not forget to take your hat from
your head when we go up into the church. I asked Biddy Flynn below,
that’s after marrying her second man, and she told me it’s the like of
that they do.

[_Mary yawns, and turns over in her sleep._

SARAH
_with anxiety._—There she is waking up on us, and I thinking we’d have
the job done before she’d know of it at all.

MICHAEL
She’ll be crying out now, and making game of us, and saying it’s fools
we are surely.

SARAH
I’ll send her to sleep again, or get her out of it one way or another;
for it’d be a bad case to have a divil’s scholar the like of her
turning the priest against us maybe with her godless talk.

MARY
_waking up, and looking at them with curiosity, blandly._—That’s fine
things you have on you, Sarah Casey; and it’s a great stir you’re
making this day, washing your face. I’m that used to the hammer, I
wouldn’t hear it at all, but washing is a rare thing, and you’re after
waking me up, and I having a great sleep in the sun.

[_She looks around cautiously at the bundle in which she has hidden the
bottles._

SARAH
_coaxingly._—Let you stretch out again for a sleep, Mary Byrne, for
it’ll be a middling time yet before we go to the fair.

MARY
_with suspicion._—That’s a sweet tongue you have, Sarah Casey; but if
sleep’s a grand thing, it’s a grand thing to be waking up a day the
like of this, when there’s a warm sun in it, and a kind air, and you’ll
hear the cuckoos singing and crying out on the top of the hills.

SARAH
If it’s that gay you are, you’d have a right to walk down and see would
you get a few halfpence from the rich men do be driving early to the
fair.

MARY
When rich men do be driving early, it’s queer tempers they have, the
Lord forgive them; the way it’s little but bad words and swearing out
you’d get from them all.

SARAH
_losing her temper and breaking out fiercely._—Then if you’ll neither
beg nor sleep, let you walk off from this place where you’re not
wanted, and not have us waiting for you maybe at the turn of day.

MARY
_rather uneasy, turning to Michael._—God help our spirits, Michael;
there she is again rousing cranky from the break of dawn. Oh! isn’t she
a terror since the moon did change? _(She gets up slowly.)_ And I’d
best be going forward to sell the gallon can.

[_She goes over and takes up the bundle._

SARAH
_crying out angrily._—Leave that down, Mary Byrne. Oh! aren’t you the
scorn of women to think that you’d have that drouth and roguery on you
that you’d go drinking the can and the dew not dried from the grass?

MARY
_in a feigned tone of pacification, with the bundle still in her
hand._—It’s not a drouth but a heartburn I have this day, Sarah Casey,
so I’m going down to cool my gullet at the blessed well; and I’ll sell
the can to the parson’s daughter below, a harmless poor creature would
fill your hand with shillings for a brace of lies.

SARAH
Leave down the tin can, Mary Byrne, for I hear the drouth upon your
tongue to-day.

MARY
There’s not a drink-house from this place to the fair, Sarah Casey; the
way you’ll find me below with the full price, and not a farthing gone.

_[She turns to go off left._

SARAH
_jumping up, and picking up the hammer threateningly._—Put down that
can, I’m saying.

MARY
_looking at her for a moment in terror, and putting down the bundle in
the ditch._—Is it raving mad you’re going, Sarah Casey, and you the
pride of women to destroy the world?

SARAH
_going up to her, and giving her a push off left._—I’ll show you if
it’s raving mad I am. Go on from this place, I’m saying, and be wary
now.

MARY
_turning back after her._—If I go, I’ll be telling old and young you’re
a weathered heathen savage, Sarah Casey, the one did put down a head of
the parson’s cabbage to boil in the pot with your clothes _(the Priest
comes in behind her, on the left, and listens)_, and quenched the
flaming candles on the throne of God the time your shadow fell within
the pillars of the chapel door.

[_Sarah turns on her, and she springs round nearly into the Priest’s
arms. When she sees him, she claps her shawl over her mouth, and goes
up towards the ditch, laughing to herself._

PRIEST
_going to Sarah, half terrified at the language that he has
heard._—Well, aren’t you a fearful lot? I’m thinking it’s only humbug
you were making at the fall of night, and you won’t need me at all.

SARAH
_with anger still in her voice._—Humbug is it! Would you be turning
back upon your spoken promise in the face of God?

PRIEST
_dubiously._—I’m thinking you were never christened, Sarah Casey; and
it would be a queer job to go dealing Christian sacraments unto the
like of you. _(Persuasively feeling in his pocket.)_ So it would be
best, maybe, I’d give you a shilling for to drink my health, and let
you walk on, and not trouble me at all.

SARAH
That’s your talking, is it? If you don’t stand to your spoken word,
holy father, I’ll make my own complaint to the mitred bishop in the
face of all.

PRIEST
You’d do that!

SARAH
I would surely, holy father, if I walked to the city of Dublin with
blood and blisters on my naked feet.

PRIEST
_uneasily scratching his ear._—I wish this day was done, Sarah Casey;
for I’m thinking it’s a risky thing getting mixed up in any matters
with the like of you.

SARAH
Be hasty then, and you’ll have us done with before you’d think at all.

PRIEST
_giving in._—Well, maybe it’s right you are, and let you come up to the
chapel when you see me looking from the door.

[_He goes up into the chapel._

SARAH
_calling after him._—We will, and God preserve you, holy father.

MARY
_coming down to them, speaking with amazement and consternation, but
without anger._—Going to the chapel! It’s at marriage you’re fooling
again, maybe? _(Sarah turns her back on her.)_ It was for that you were
washing your face, and you after sending me for porter at the fall of
night the way I’d drink a good half from the jug? _(Going round in
front of Sarah.)_ Is it at marriage you’re fooling again?

SARAH
_triumphantly._—It is, Mary Byrne. I’ll be married now in a short
while; and from this day there will no one have a right to call me a
dirty name and I selling cans in Wicklow or Wexford or the city of
Dublin itself.

MARY
_turning to Michael._—And it’s yourself is wedding her, Michael Byrne?

MICHAEL
_gloomily._—It is, God spare us.

MARY
_looks at Sarah for a moment, and then bursts out into a laugh of
derision._—Well, she’s a tight, hardy girl, and it’s no lie; but I
never knew till this day it was a black born fool I had for a son.
You’ll breed asses, I’ve heard them say, and poaching dogs, and
horses’d go licking the wind, but it’s a hard thing, God help me, to
breed sense in a son.

MICHAEL
_gloomily._—If I didn’t marry her, she’d be walking off to Jaunting Jim
maybe at the fall of night; and it’s well yourself knows there isn’t
the like of her for getting money and selling songs to the men.

MARY
And you’re thinking it’s paying gold to his reverence would make a
woman stop when she’s a mind to go?

SARAH
_angrily._—Let you not be destroying us with your talk when I’ve as
good a right to a decent marriage as any speckled female does be
sleeping in the black hovels above, would choke a mule.

MARY
_soothingly._—It’s as good a right you have surely, Sarah Casey, but
what good will it do? Is it putting that ring on your finger will keep
you from getting an aged woman and losing the fine face you have, or be
easing your pains, when it’s the grand ladies do be married in silk
dresses, with rings of gold, that do pass any woman with their share of
torment in the hour of birth, and do be paying the doctors in the city
of Dublin a great price at that time, the like of what you’d pay for a
good ass and a cart?

[_She sits down._

SARAH
_puzzled._—Is that the truth?

MARY
_pleased with the point she has made._—Wouldn’t any know it’s the
truth? Ah, it’s a few short years you are yet in the world, Sarah
Casey, and it’s little or nothing at all maybe you know about it.

SARAH
_vehement but uneasy._—What is it yourself knows of the fine ladies
when they wouldn’t let the like of you go near them at all?

MARY
If you do be drinking a little sup in one town and another town, it’s
soon you get great knowledge and a great sight into the world. You’ll
see men there, and women there, sitting up on the ends of barrels in
the dark night, and they making great talk would soon have the like of
you, Sarah Casey, as wise as a March hare.

MICHAEL
_to Sarah._—That’s the truth she’s saying, and maybe if you’ve sense in
you at all, you’d have a right still to leave your fooling, and not be
wasting our gold.

SARAH
_decisively._—If it’s wise or fool I am, I’ve made a good bargain and
I’ll stand to it now.

MARY
What is it he’s making you give?

MICHAEL
The ten shillings in gold, and the tin can is above tied in the sack.

MARY
_looking at the bundle with surprise and dread._—The bit of gold and
the tin can, is it?

MICHAEL
The half a sovereign, and the gallon can.

MARY
_scrambling to her feet quickly._—Well, I think I’ll be walking off the
road to the fair the way you won’t be destroying me going too fast on
the hills. _(She goes a few steps towards the left, then turns and
speaks to Sarah very persuasively._) Let you not take the can from the
sack, Sarah Casey; for the people is coming above would be making game
of you, and pointing their fingers if they seen you do the like of
that. Let you leave it safe in the bag, I’m saying, Sarah darling. It’s
that way will be best.

[_She goes towards left, and pauses for a moment, looking about her
with embarrassment._

MICHAEL
_in a low voice._—What ails her at all?

SARAH
_anxiously._—It’s real wicked she does be when you hear her speaking as
easy as that.

MARY
_to herself._—I’d be safer in the chapel, I’m thinking; for if she
caught me after on the road, maybe she would kill me then.

[_She comes hobbling back towards the right._

SARAH
Where is it you’re going? It isn’t that way we’ll be walking to the
fair.

MARY
I’m going up into the chapel to give you my blessing and hear the
priest saying his prayers. It’s a lonesome road is running below to
Greenane, and a woman would never know the things might happen her and
she walking single in a lonesome place.

[_As she reaches the chapel-gate, the Priest comes to it in his
surplice._

PRIEST
_crying out._—Come along now. It is the whole day you’d keep me here
saying my prayers, and I getting my death with not a bit in my stomach,
and my breakfast in ruins, and the Lord Bishop maybe driving on the
road to-day?

SARAH
We’re coming now, holy father.

PRIEST
Give me the bit of gold into my hand.

SARAH
It’s here, holy father.

[_She gives it to him. Michael takes the bundle from the ditch and
brings it over, standing a little behind Sarah. He feels the bundle,
and looks at Mary with a meaning look._

PRIEST
_looking at the gold._—It’s a good one, I’m thinking, wherever you got
it. And where is the can?

SARAH
_taking the bundle._—We have it here in a bit of clean sack, your
reverence. We tied it up in the inside of that to keep it from rusting
in the dews of night, and let you not open it now or you’ll have the
people making game of us and telling the story on us, east and west to
the butt of the hills.

PRIEST
_taking the bundle._—Give it here into my hand, Sarah Casey. What is it
any person would think of a tinker making a can.

[_He begins opening the bundle._

SARAH
It’s a fine can, your reverence. for if it’s poor simple people we are,
it’s fine cans we can make, and himself, God help him, is a great man
surely at the trade.

[_Priest opens the bundle; the three empty bottles fall out._

SARAH
Glory to the saints of joy!

PRIEST
Did ever any man see the like of that? To think you’d be putting deceit
on me, and telling lies to me, and I going to marry you for a little
sum wouldn’t marry a child.

SARAH
_crestfallen and astonished._—It’s the divil did it, your reverence,
and I wouldn’t tell you a lie. _(Raising her hands.)_ May the Lord
Almighty strike me dead if the divil isn’t after hooshing the tin can
from the bag.

PRIEST
_vehemently._—Go along now, and don’t be swearing your lies. Go along
now, and let you not be thinking I’m big fool enough to believe the
like of that, when it’s after selling it you are or making a swap for
drink of it, maybe, in the darkness of the night.

MARY
_in a peacemaking voice, putting her hand on the Priest’s left
arm._—She wouldn’t do the like of that, your reverence, when she hasn’t
a decent standing drouth on her at all; and she’s setting great store
on her marriage the way you’d have a right to be taking her easy, and
not minding the can. What differ would an empty can make with a fine,
rich, hardy man the like of you?

SARAH
_imploringly._—Marry us, your reverence, for the ten shillings in gold,
and we’ll make you a grand can in the evening—a can would be fit to
carry water for the holy man of God. Marry us now and I’ll be saying
fine prayers for you, morning and night, if it’d be raining itself, and
it’d be in two black pools I’d be setting my knees.

PRIEST
_loudly._—It’s a wicked, thieving, lying, scheming lot you are, the
pack of you. Let you walk off now and take every stinking rag you have
there from the ditch.

MARY
_putting her shawl over her head._—Marry her, your reverence, for the
love of God, for there’ll be queer doings below if you send her off the
like of that and she swearing crazy on the road.

SARAH
_angrily._—It’s the truth she’s saying; for it’s herself, I’m thinking,
is after swapping the tin can for a pint, the time she was raging mad
with the drouth, and ourselves above walking the hill.

MARY
_crying out with indignation._—Have you no shame, Sarah Casey, to tell
lies unto a holy man?

SARAH
_to Mary, working herself into a rage._—It’s making game of me you’d
be, and putting a fool’s head on me in the face of the world; but if
you were thinking to be mighty cute walking off, or going up to hide in
the church, I’ve got you this time, and you’ll not run from me now.

_She seizes up one of the bottles._

MARY
_hiding behind the priest._—Keep her off, your reverence, keep her off
for the love of the Almighty God. What at all would the Lord Bishop say
if he found me here lying with my head broken across, or the two of
yous maybe digging a bloody grave for me at the door of the church?

PRIEST
_waving Sarah off._—Go along, Sarah Casey. Would you be doing murder at
my feet? Go along from me now, and wasn’t I a big fool to have to do
with you when it’s nothing but distraction and torment I get from the
kindness of my heart?

SARAH
_shouting._—I’ve bet a power of strong lads east and west through the
world, and are you thinking I’d turn back from a priest? Leave the road
now, or maybe I would strike yourself.

PRIEST
You would not, Sarah Casey. I’ve no fear for the lot of you; but let
you walk off, I’m saying, and not be coming where you’ve no business,
and screeching tumult and murder at the doorway of the church.

SARAH
I’ll not go a step till I have her head broke, or till I’m wed with
himself. If you want to get shut of us, let you marry us now, for I’m
thinking the ten shillings in gold is a good price for the like of you,
and you near burst with the fat.

PRIEST
I wouldn’t have you coming in on me and soiling my church; for there’s
nothing at all, I’m thinking, would keep the like of you from hell.
_(He throws down the ten shillings on the ground.)_ Gather up your gold
now, and begone from my sight, for if ever I set an eye on you again
you’ll hear me telling the peelers who it was stole the black ass
belonging to Philly O’Cullen, and whose hay it is the grey ass does be
eating.

SARAH
You’d do that?

PRIEST
I would, surely.

SARAH
If you do, you’ll be getting all the tinkers from Wicklow and Wexford,
and the County Meath, to put up block tin in the place of glass to
shield your windows where you do be looking out and blinking at the
girls. It’s hard set you’ll be that time, I’m telling you, to fill the
depth of your belly the long days of Lent; for we wouldn’t leave a
laying pullet in your yard at all.

PRIEST
_losing his temper finally._—Go on, now, or I’ll send the Lords of
Justice a dated story of your villainies—burning, stealing, robbing,
raping to this mortal day. Go on now, I’m saying, if you’d run from
Kilmainham or the rope itself.

MICHAEL
_taking off his coat._—Is it run from the like of you, holy father? Go
up to your own shanty, or I’ll beat you with the ass’s reins till the
world would hear you roaring from this place to the coast of Clare.

PRIEST
Is it lift your hand upon myself when the Lord would blight your
members if you’d touch me now? Go on from this.

[_He gives him a shove._

MICHAEL
Blight me is it? Take it then, your reverence, and God help you so.

[_He runs at him with the reins._

PRIEST
_runs up to ditch crying out._—There are the peelers passing by the
grace of God—hey, below!

MARY
_clapping her hand over his mouth._—Knock him down on the road; they
didn’t hear him at all.

[_Michael pulls him down._

SARAH
Gag his jaws.

MARY
Stuff the sacking in his teeth.

[_They gag him with the sack that had the can in it._

SARAH
Tie the bag around his head, and if the peelers come, we’ll put him
head-first in the boghole is beyond the ditch.

[_They tie him up in some sacking._

MICHAEL
_to Mary._—Keep him quiet, and the rags tight on him for fear he’d
screech. _(He goes back to their camp.)_ Hurry with the things, Sarah
Casey. The peelers aren’t coming this way, and maybe we’ll get off from
them now.

[_They bundle the things together in wild haste, the priest wriggling
and struggling about on the ground, with old Mary trying to keep him
quiet._

MARY
_patting his head._—Be quiet, your reverence. What is it ails you, with
your wrigglings now? Is it choking maybe? _(She puts her hand under the
sack, and feels his mouth, patting him on the back.)_ It’s only letting
on you are, holy father, for your nose is blowing back and forward as
easy as an east wind on an April day. _(In a soothing voice.)_ There
now, holy father, let you stay easy, I’m telling you, and learn a
little sense and patience, the way you’ll not be so airy again going to
rob poor sinners of their scraps of gold. _(He gets quieter.)_ That’s a
good boy you are now, your reverence, and let you not be uneasy, for we
wouldn’t hurt you at all. It’s sick and sorry we are to tease you; but
what did you want meddling with the like of us, when it’s a long time
we are going our own ways—father and son, and his son after him, or
mother and daughter, and her own daughter again—and it’s little need we
ever had of going up into a church and swearing—I’m told there’s
swearing with it—a word no man would believe, or with drawing rings on
our fingers, would be cutting our skins maybe when we’d be taking the
ass from the shafts, and pulling the straps the time they’d be slippy
with going around beneath the heavens in rains falling.

MICHAEL
_who has finished bundling up the things, comes over to Sarah._—We’re
fixed now; and I have a mind to run him in a boghole the way he’ll not
be tattling to the peelers of our games to-day.

SARAH
You’d have a right too, I’m thinking.

MARY
_soothingly._—Let you not be rough with him, Sarah Casey, and he after
drinking his sup of porter with us at the fall of night. Maybe he’d
swear a mighty oath he wouldn’t harm us, and then we’d safer loose him;
for if we went to drown him, they’d maybe hang the batch of us, man and
child and woman, and the ass itself.

MICHAEL
What would he care for an oath?

MARY
Don’t you know his like do live in terror of the wrath of God?
_(Putting her mouth to the Priest’s ear in the sacking.)_ Would you
swear an oath, holy father, to leave us in our freedom, and not talk at
all? _(Priest nods in sacking.)_ Didn’t I tell you? Look at the poor
fellow nodding his head off in the bias of the sacks. Strip them off
from him, and he’ll be easy now.

MICHAEL
_as if speaking to a horse._—Hold up, holy father.

[_He pulls the sacking off, and shows the priest with his hair on end.
They free his mouth._

MARY
Hold him till he swears.

PRIEST
_in a faint voice._—I swear surely. If you let me go in peace, I’ll not
inform against you or say a thing at all, and may God forgive me for
giving heed unto your like to-day.

SARAH
_puts the ring on his finger._—There’s the ring, holy father, to keep
you minding of your oath until the end of time; for my heart’s scalded
with your fooling; and it’ll be a long day till I go making talk of
marriage or the like of that.

MARY
_complacently, standing up slowly._—She’s vexed now, your reverence;
and let you not mind her at all, for she’s right surely, and it’s
little need we ever had of the like of you to get us our bit to eat,
and our bit to drink, and our time of love when we were young men and
women, and were fine to look at.

MICHAEL
Hurry on now. He’s a great man to have kept us from fooling our gold;
and we’ll have a great time drinking that bit with the trampers on the
green of Clash.

[_They gather up their things. The priest stands up._

PRIEST
_lifting up his hand._—I’ve sworn not to call the hand of man upon your
crimes to-day; but I haven’t sworn I wouldn’t call the fire of heaven
from the hand of the Almighty God.

[_He begins saying a Latin malediction in a loud ecclesiastical voice._

MARY
There’s an old villain.

ALL
_together._—Run, run. Run for your lives.

[_They rush out, leaving the Priest master of the situation._

[Roadside with big stones, etc., on the right; low loose wall at back
with gap near centre; at left, ruined doorway of church with bushes
beside it. Martin Doul and Mary Doul grope in on left and pass over to
stones on right, where they sit.]

MARY DOUL. What place are we now, Martin Doul?

MARTIN DOUL. Passing the gap.

MARY DOUL -- [raising her head.] -- The length of that! Well, the sun's
getting warm this day if it's late autumn itself.

MARTIN DOUL -- [putting out his hands in sun.] -- What way wouldn't
it be warm and it getting high up in the south? You were that length
plaiting your yellow hair you have the morning lost on us, and the
people are after passing to the fair of Clash.

MARY DOUL. It isn't going to the fair, the time they do be driving their
cattle and they with a litter of pigs maybe squealing in their carts,
they'd give us a thing at all. (She sits down.) It's well you know that,
but you must be talking.

MARTIN DOUL -- [sitting down beside her and beginning to shred rushes
she gives him.] -- If I didn't talk I'd be destroyed in a short while
listening to the clack you do be making, for you've a queer cracked
voice, the Lord have mercy on you, if it's fine to look on you are
itself.

MARY DOUL. Who wouldn't have a cracked voice sitting out all the year
in the rain falling? It's a bad life for the voice, Martin Doul, though
I've heard tell there isn't anything like the wet south wind does be
blowing upon us for keeping a white beautiful skin -- the like of my
skin -- on your neck and on your brows, and there isn't anything at all
like a fine skin for putting splendour on a woman.

MARTIN DOUL -- [teasingly, but with good humour.] -- I do be thinking
odd times we don't know rightly what way you have your splendour, or
asking myself, maybe, if you have it at all, for the time I was a young
lad, and had fine sight, it was the ones with sweet voices were the best
in face.

MARY DOUL. Let you not be making the like of that talk when you've heard
Timmy the smith, and Mat Simon, and Patch Ruadh, and a power besides
saying fine things of my face, and you know rightly it was "the
beautiful dark woman" they did call me in Ballinatone.

MARTIN DOUL -- [as before.] -- If it was itself I heard Molly Byrne
saying at the fall of night it was little more than a fright you were.

MARY DOUL -- [sharply.] -- She was jealous, God forgive her, because
Timmy the smith was after praising my hair.

MARTIN DOUL -- [with mock irony.] -- Jealous!

MARY DOUL. Ay, jealous, Martin Doul; and if she wasn't itself, the young
and silly do be always making game of them that's dark, and they'd think
it a fine thing if they had us deceived, the way we wouldn't know we
were so fine-looking at all.

[She puts her hand to her face with a complacent gesture.]

MARTIN DOUL -- [a little plaintively.] -- I do be thinking in the long
nights it'd be a grand thing if we could see ourselves for one hour, or
a minute itself, the way we'd know surely we were the finest man and the
finest woman of the seven counties of the east (bitterly) and then the
seeing rabble below might be destroying their souls telling bad lies,
and we'd never heed a thing they'd say.

MARY DOUL. If you weren't a big fool you wouldn't heed them this hour,
Martin Doul, for they're a bad lot those that have their sight, and they
do have great joy, the time they do be seeing a grand thing, to let on
they don't see it at all, and to be telling fool's lies, the like of
what Molly Byrne was telling to yourself.

MARTIN DOUL. If it's lies she does be telling she's a sweet, beautiful
voice you'd never tire to be hearing, if it was only the pig she'd
be calling, or crying out in the long grass, maybe after her hens.
(Speaking pensively.) It should be a fine, soft, rounded woman, I'm
thinking, would have a voice the like of that.

MARY DOUL -- [sharply again, scandalized.] -- Let you not be minding if
it's flat or rounded she is; for she's a flighty, foolish woman, you'll
hear when you're off a long way, and she making a great noise and
laughing at the well.

MARTIN DOUL. Isn't laughing a nice thing the time a woman's young?

MARY DOUL -- [bitterly.] -- A nice thing is it? A nice thing to hear a
woman making a loud braying laugh the like of that? Ah, she's a great
one for drawing the men, and you'll hear Timmy himself, the time he does
be sitting in his forge, getting mighty fussy if she'll come walking
from Grianan, the way you'll hear his breath going, and he wringing his
hands.

MARTIN DOUL -- [slightly piqued.] -- I've heard him say a power of times
it's nothing at all she is when you see her at the side of you, and yet
I never heard any man's breath getting uneasy the time he'd be looking
on yourself.

MARY DOUL. I'm not the like of the girls do be running round on the
roads, swinging their legs, and they with their necks out looking on the
men.... Ah, there's a power of villainy walking the world, Martin Doul,
among them that do be gadding around with their gaping eyes, and their
sweet words, and they with no sense in them at all.

MARTIN DOUL -- [sadly.] -- It's the truth, maybe, and yet I'm told it's
a grand thing to see a young girl walking the road.

MARY DOUL. You'd be as bad as the rest of them if you had your sight,
and I did well, surely, not to marry a seeing man it's scores would have
had me and welcome -- for the seeing is a queer lot, and you'd never
know the thing they'd do. [A moment's pause.]

MARTIN DOUL -- [listening.] -- There's some one coming on the road.

MARY DOUL. Let you put the pith away out of their sight, or they'll be
picking it out with the spying eyes they have, and saying it's rich we
are, and not sparing us a thing at all.

[They bundle away the rushes. Timmy the smith comes in on left.]

MARTIN DOUL -- [with a begging voice.] -- Leave a bit of silver for
blind Martin, your honour. Leave a bit of silver, or a penny copper
itself, and we'll be praying the Lord to bless you and you going the
way.

TIMMY -- [stopping before them.] -- And you letting on a while back you
knew my step! [He sits down.]

MARTIN -- [with his natural voice.] -- I know it when Molly Byrne's
walking in front, or when she's two perches, maybe, lagging behind; but
it's few times I've heard you walking up the like of that, as if you'd
met a thing wasn't right and you coming on the road.

TIMMY -- [hot and breathless, wiping his face.] -- You've good ears, God
bless you, if you're a liar itself; for I'm after walking up in great
haste from hearing wonders in the fair.

MARTIN DOUL -- [rather contemptuously.] -- You're always hearing queer
wonderful things, and the lot of them nothing at all; but I'm thinking,
this time, it's a strange thing surely you'd be walking up before the
turn of day, and not waiting below to look on them lepping, or dancing,
or playing shows on the green of Clash.

TIMMY -- [huffed.] -- I was coming to tell you it's in this place
there'd be a bigger wonder done in a short while (Martin Doul stops
working) than was ever done on the green of Clash, or the width of
Leinster itself; but you're thinking, maybe, you're too cute a little
fellow to be minding me at all.

MARTIN DOUL -- [amused, but incredulous.] -- There'll be wonders in this
place, is it?

TIMMY. Here at the crossing of the roads.

MARTIN DOUL. I never heard tell of anything to happen in this place
since the night they killed the old fellow going home with his gold, the
Lord have mercy on him, and threw down his corpse into the bog. Let
them not be doing the like of that this night, for it's ourselves have
a right to the crossing roads, and we don't want any of your bad tricks,
or your wonders either, for it's wonder enough we are ourselves.

TIMMY. If I'd a mind I'd be telling you of a real wonder this day, and
the way you'll be having a great joy, maybe, you're not thinking on at
all.

MARTIN DOUL -- [interested.] -- Are they putting up a still behind in
the rocks? It'd be a grand thing if I'd sup handy the way I wouldn't be
destroying myself groping up across the bogs in the rain falling.

TIMMY -- [still moodily.] -- It's not a still they're bringing, or the
like of it either.

MARY DOUL -- [persuasively, to Timmy.] -- Maybe they're hanging a thief,
above at the bit of a tree. I'm told it's a great sight to see a man
hanging by his neck; but what joy would that be to ourselves, and we not
seeing it at all?

TIMMY -- [more pleasantly.] -- They're hanging no one this day, Mary
Doul, and yet, with the help of God, you'll see a power hanged before
you die.

MARY DOUL. Well you've queer hum-bugging talk.... What way would I see a
power hanged, and I a dark woman since the seventh year of my age?

TIMMY. Did ever you hear tell of a place across a bit of the sea, where
there is an island, and the grave of the four beautiful saints?

MARY DOUL. I've heard people have walked round from the west and they
speaking of that.

TIMMY -- [impressively.] -- There's a green ferny well, I'm told, behind
of that place, and if you put a drop of the water out of it on the eyes
of a blind man, you'll make him see as well as any person is walking the
world.

MARTIN DOUL -- [with excitement.] -- Is that the truth, Timmy? I'm
thinking you're telling a lie.

TIMMY -- [gruffly.] -- That's the truth, Martin Doul, and you may
believe it now, for you're after believing a power of things weren't as
likely at all.

MARY DOUL. Maybe we could send us a young lad to bring us the water. I
could wash a naggin bottle in the morning, and I'm thinking Patch Ruadh
would go for it, if we gave him a good drink, and the bit of money we
have hid in the thatch.

TIMMY. It'd be no good to be sending a sinful man the like of ourselves,
for I'm told the holiness of the water does be getting soiled with the
villainy of your heart, the time you'd be carrying it, and you looking
round on the girls, maybe, or drinking a small sup at a still.

MARTIN DOUL -- [with disappointment.] -- It'd be a long terrible way to
be walking ourselves, and I'm thinking that's a wonder will bring small
joy to us at all.

TIMMY -- [turning on him impatiently.] -- What is it you want with
your walking? It's as deaf as blind you're growing if you're not after
hearing me say it's in this place the wonder would be done.

MARTIN DOUL -- [with a flash of anger.] -- If it is can't you open the
big slobbering mouth you have and say what way it'll be done, and not be
making blather till the fall of night.

TIMMY -- [jumping up.] -- I'll be going on now (Mary Doul rises), and
not wasting time talking civil talk with the like of you.

MARY DOUL -- [standing up, disguising her impatience.] -- Let you come
here to me, Timmy, and not be minding him at all. [Timmy stops, and
she gropes up to him and takes him by the coat).] You're not huffy with
myself, and let you tell me the whole story and don't be fooling me
more.... Is it yourself has brought us the water?

TIMMY. It is not, surely.

MARY DOUL. Then tell us your wonder, Timmy.... What person'll bring it
at all?

TIMMY -- [relenting.] -- It's a fine holy man will bring it, a saint of
the Almighty God.

MARY DOUL -- [overawed.] -- A saint is it?

TIMMY. Ay, a fine saint, who's going round through the churches of
Ireland, with a long cloak on him, and naked feet, for he's brought
a sup of the water slung at his side, and, with the like of him, any
little drop is enough to cure the dying, or to make the blind see as
clear as the gray hawks do be high up, on a still day, sailing the sky.

MARTIN DOUL -- [feeling for his stick.] -- What place is he, Timmy? I'll
be walking to him now.

TIMMY. Let you stay quiet, Martin. He's straying around saying prayers
at the churches and high crosses, between this place and the hills, and
he with a great crowd go- ing behind -- for it's fine prayers he does
be saying, and fasting with it, till he's as thin as one of the empty
rushes you have there on your knee; then he'll be coming after to this
place to cure the two of you -- we're after telling him the way you are
-- and to say his prayers in the church.

MARTIN DOUL -- [turning suddenly to Mary Doul.] -- And we'll be seeing
ourselves this day. Oh, glory be to God, is it true surely?

MARY DOUL -- [very pleased, to Timmy.] -- Maybe I'd have time to walk
down and get the big shawl I have below, for I do look my best, I've
heard them say, when I'm dressed up with that thing on my head.

TIMMY. You'd have time surely.

MARTIN DOUL -- [listening.] Whisht now.... I hear people again coming by
the stream.

TIMMY -- [looking out left, puzzled.] -- It's the young girls I left
walking after the Saint.... They're coming now (goes up to entrance)
carrying things in their hands, and they walking as easy as you'd see a
child walk who'd have a dozen eggs hid in her bib.

MARTIN DOUL -- [listening.] -- That's Molly Byrne, I'm thinking.

[Molly Byrne and Bride come on left and cross to Martin Doul, carrying
water-can, Saint's bell, and cloak.]

MOLLY -- [volubly.] -- God bless you, Martin. I've holy water here, from
the grave of the four saints of the west, will have you cured in a short
while and seeing like ourselves.

TIMMY -- [crosses to Molly, interrupting her.] -- He's heard that.
God help you. But where at all is the Saint, and what way is he after
trusting the holy water with the likes of you?

MOLLY BYRNE. He was afeard to go a far way with the clouds is coming
beyond, so he's gone up now through the thick woods to say a prayer at
the crosses of Grianan, and he's coming on this road to the church.

TIMMY -- [still astonished.] -- And he's after leaving the holy water
with the two of you? It's a wonder, surely. [Comes down left a little.]

MOLLY BYRNE. The lads told him no person could carry them things through
the briars, and steep, slippy-feeling rocks he'll be climbing above,
so he looked round then, and gave the water, and his big cloak, and his
bell to the two of us, for young girls, says he, are the cleanest holy
people you'd see walking the world. [Mary Doul goes near seat.]

MARY DOUL -- [sits down, laughing to herself.] -- Well, the Saint's a
simple fellow, and it's no lie.

MARTIN DOUL -- [leaning forward, holding out his hands.] -- Let you
give me the water in my hand, Molly Byrne, the way I'll know you have it
surely.

MOLLY BYRNE -- [giving it to him.] -- Wonders is queer things, and maybe
it'd cure you, and you holding it alone.

MARTIN DOUL -- [looking round.] -- It does not, Molly. I'm not seeing
at all. (He shakes the can.) There's a small sup only. Well, isn't it a
great wonder the little trifling thing would bring seeing to the blind,
and be showing us the big women and the young girls, and all the fine
things is walking the world.

[He feels for Mary Doul and gives her the can.]

MARY DOUL -- [shaking it.] -- Well, glory be to God.

MARTIN DOUL -- [pointing to Bride.] -- And what is it herself has,
making sounds in her hand?

BRIDE -- [crossing to Martin Doul.] -- It's the Saint's bell; you'll
hear him ringing out the time he'll be going up some place, to be saying
his prayers.


[Martin Doul holds out his hand; she gives it to him.]

MARTIN DOUL -- [ringing it.] -- It's a sweet, beautiful sound.

MARY DOUL. You'd know, I'm thinking, by the little silvery voice of it,
a fasting holy man was after carrying it a great way at his side.

[Bride crosses a little right behind Martin Doul.]

MOLLY BYRNE -- [unfolding Saint's cloak.] -- Let you stand up now,
Martin Doul, till I put his big cloak on you. (Martin Doul rises, comes
forward, centre a little.) The way we'd see how you'd look, and you a
saint of the Almighty God.

MARTIN DOUL -- [standing up, a little diffidently.] -- I've heard the
priests a power of times making great talk and praises of the beauty of
the saints. [Molly Byrne slips cloak round him.]

TIMMY -- [uneasily.] -- You'd have a right to be leaving him alone,
Molly. What would the Saint say if he seen you making game with his
cloak?

MOLLY BYRNE -- [recklessly.] -- How would he see us, and he saying
prayers in the wood? (She turns Martin Doul round.) Isn't that a fine
holy-looking saint, Timmy the smith? (Laughing foolishly.) There's a
grand, handsome fellow, Mary Doul; and if you seen him now you'd be as
proud, I'm thinking, as the archangels below, fell out with the Almighty
God.

MARY DOUL -- [with quiet confidence going to Martin Doul and feeling his
cloak.] -- It's proud we'll be this day, surely. [Martin Doul is still
ringing.]

MOLLY BYRNE -- [to Martin Doul.] -- Would you think well to be all your
life walking round the like of that, Martin Doul, and you bell-ringing
with the saints of God?

MARY DOUL -- [turning on her, fiercely.] -- How would he be bell-ringing
with the saints of God and he wedded with myself?

MARTIN DOUL. It's the truth she's saying, and if bell-ringing is a
fine life, yet I'm thinking, maybe, it's better I am wedded with the
beautiful dark woman of Ballinatone.

MOLLY BYRNE -- [scornfully.] -- You're thinking that, God help you; but
it's little you know of her at all.

MARTIN DOUL. It's little surely, and I'm destroyed this day waiting to
look upon her face.

TIMMY -- [awkwardly.] -- It's well you know the way she is; for the like
of you do have great knowledge in the feeling of your hands.

MARTIN DOUL -- [still feeling the cloak.] -- We do, maybe. Yet it's
little I know of faces, or of fine beautiful cloaks, for it's few cloaks
I've had my hand to, and few faces (plaintively); for the young girls is
mighty shy, Timmy the smith and it isn't much they heed me, though they
do be saying I'm a handsome man.

MARY DOUL -- [mockingly, with good humour.] -- Isn't it a queer
thing the voice he puts on him, when you hear him talking of the
skinny-looking girls, and he married with a woman he's heard called the
wonder of the western world?

TIMMY -- [pityingly.] -- The two of you will see a great wonder this
day, and it's no lie.

MARTIN DOUL. I've heard tell her yellow hair, and her white skin, and
her big eyes are a wonder, surely.

BRIDE -- [who has looked out left.] -- Here's the saint coming from the
selvage of the wood.... Strip the cloak from him, Molly, or he'll be
seeing it now.

MOLLY BYRNE -- [hastily to Bride.] -- Take the bell and put yourself by
the stones. (To Martin Doul.) Will you hold your head up till I loosen
the cloak? (She pulls off the cloak and throws it over her arm. Then she
pushes Martin Doul over and stands him beside Mary Doul.) Stand there
now, quiet, and let you not be saying a word.

[She and Bride stand a little on their left, demurely, with bell, etc.,
in their hands.]

MARTIN DOUL -- [nervously arranging his clothes.] -- Will he mind the
way we are, and not tidied or washed cleanly at all?

MOLLY BYRNE. He'll not see what way you are.... He'd walk by the finest
woman in Ireland, I'm thinking, and not trouble to raise his two eyes to
look upon her face.... Whisht!

[The Saint comes left, with crowd.]

SAINT. Are these the two poor people?

TIMMY -- [officiously.] -- They are, holy father; they do be always
sitting here at the crossing of the roads, asking a bit of copper from
them that do pass, or stripping rushes for lights, and they not mournful
at all, but talking out straight with a full voice, and making game with
them that likes it.

SAINT -- [to Martin Doul and Mary Doul.] -- It's a hard life you've had
not seeing sun or moon, or the holy priests itself praying to the Lord,
but it's the like of you who are brave in a bad time will make a fine
use of the gift of sight the Almighty God will bring to you today. (He
takes his cloak and puts it about him.) It's on a bare starving rock
that there's the grave of the four beauties of God, the way it's little
wonder, I'm thinking, if it's with bare starving people the water
should be used. (He takes the water and bell and slings them round his
shoulders.) So it's to the like of yourselves I do be going, who are
wrinkled and poor, a thing rich men would hardly look at at all, but
would throw a coin to or a crust of bread.

MARTIN DOUL -- [moving uneasily.] -- When they look on herself, who is a
fine woman.

TIMMY -- [shaking him.] -- Whisht now, and be listening to the Saint.

SAINT -- [looks at them a moment, continues.] -- If it's raggy and dirty
you are itself, I'm saying, the Almighty God isn't at all like the rich
men of Ireland; and, with the power of the water I'm after bringing in
a little curagh into Cashla Bay, He'll have pity on you, and put sight
into your eyes.

MARTIN DOUL -- [taking off his hat.] -- I'm ready now, holy father.

SAINT -- [taking him by the hand.] -- I'll cure you first, and then I'll
come for your wife. We'll go up now into the church, for I must say
a prayer to the Lord. (To Mary Doul, as he moves off.) And let you be
making your mind still and saying praises in your heart, for it's a
great wonderful thing when the power of the Lord of the world is brought
down upon your like.

PEOPLE -- [pressing after him.] -- Come now till we watch.

BRIDE. Come, Timmy.

SAINT -- [waving them back.] -- Stay back where you are, for I'm not
wanting a big crowd making whispers in the church. Stay back there,
I'm saying, and you'd do well to be thinking on the way sin has brought
blindness to the world, and to be saying a prayer for your own sakes
against false prophets and heathens, and the words of women and smiths,
and all knowledge that would soil the soul or the body of a man.

[People shrink back. He goes into church. Mary Doul gropes half-way
towards the door and kneels near path. People form a group at right.]

TIMMY. Isn't it a fine, beautiful voice he has, and he a fine, brave man
if it wasn't for the fasting?

BRIDE. Did you watch him moving his hands?

MOLLY BYRNE. It'd be a fine thing if some one in this place could pray
the like of him, for I'm thinking the water from our own blessed well
would do rightly if a man knew the way to be saying prayers, and then
there'd be no call to be bringing water from that wild place, where, I'm
told, there are no decent houses, or fine-looking people at all.

BRIDE -- [who is looking in at door from right.] -- Look at the great
trembling Martin has shaking him, and he on his knees.

TIMMY -- [anxiously.] -- God help him... What will he be doing when he
sees his wife this day? I'm thinking it was bad work we did when we let
on she was fine-looking, and not a wrinkled, wizened hag the way she is.

MAT SIMON. Why would he be vexed, and we after giving him great joy and
pride, the time he was dark?

MOLLY BYRNE -- [sitting down in Mary Doul's seat and tidying her hair.]
-- If it's vexed he is itself, he'll have other things now to think on
as well as his wife; and what does any man care for a wife, when it's
two weeks or three, he is looking on her face?

MAT SIMON. That's the truth now, Molly, and it's more joy dark Martin
got from the lies we told of that hag is kneeling by the path than your
own man will get from you, day or night, and he living at your side.

MOLLY BYRNE -- [defiantly.] -- Let you not be talking, Mat Simon, for
it's not yourself will be my man, though you'd be crowing and singing
fine songs if you'd that hope in you at all.

TIMMY -- [shocked, to Molly Byrne.] -- Let you not be raising your voice
when the Saint's above at his prayers.

BRIDE -- [crying out.] -- Whisht.... Whisht.... I'm thinking he's cured.

MARTIN DOUL -- [crying out in the church.] -- Oh, glory be to God....

SAINT -- [solemnly.] Laus Patri sit et Filio cum Spiritu Paraclito Qui
Suae dono gratiae misertus est Hiberniae....

MARTIN DOUL -- [ecstatically.] -- Oh, glory be to God, I see now
surely.... I see the walls of the church, and the green bits of ferns in
them, and yourself, holy father, and the great width of the sky.

[He runs out half-foolish with joy, and comes past Mary Doul as she
scrambles to her feet, drawing a little away from her as he goes by.]

TIMMY -- [to the others.] -- He doesn't know her at all.

[The Saint comes out behind Martin Doul, and leads Mary Doul into the
church. Martin Doul comes on to the People. The men are between him and
the Girls; he verifies his position with his stick.]

MARTIN DOUL -- [crying out joyfully.] -- That's Timmy, I know Timmy by
the black of his head.... That's Mat Simon, I know Mat by the length of
his legs.... That should be Patch Ruadh, with the gamey eyes in him, and
the fiery hair. (He sees Molly Byrne on Mary Doul's seat, and his voice
changes completely.) Oh, it was no lie they told me, Mary Doul. Oh,
glory to God and the seven saints I didn't die and not see you at all.
The blessing of God on the water, and the feet carried it round through
the land. The blessing of God on this day, and them that brought me
the Saint, for it's grand hair you have (she lowers her head a little
confused), and soft skin, and eyes would make the saints, if they were
dark awhile and seeing again, fall down out of the sky. (He goes nearer
to her.) Hold up your head, Mary, the way I'll see it's richer I am than
the great kings of the east. Hold up your head, I'm saying, for it's
soon you'll be seeing me, and I not a bad one at all. [He touches her
and she starts up.]

MOLLY BYRNE. Let you keep away from me, and not be soiling my chin.
[People laugh heartily.]

MARTIN DOUL -- [bewildered.] -- It's Molly's voice you have.

MOLLY BYRNE. Why wouldn't I have my own voice? Do you think I'm a ghost?

MARTIN DOUL. Which of you all is herself? (He goes up to Bride.) Is it
you is Mary Doul? I'm thinking you're more the like of what they said
(peering at her.) For you've yellow hair, and white skin, and it's the
smell of my own turf is rising from your shawl. [He catches her shawl.]

BRIDE -- [pulling away her shawl.] -- I'm not your wife, and let you get
out of my way. [The People laugh again.]

MARTIN DOUL -- [with misgiving, to another Girl.] -- Is it yourself
it is? You're not so fine-looking, but I'm thinking you'd do, with the
grand nose you have, and your nice hands and your feet.

GIRL -- [scornfully.] -- I never seen any person that took me for blind,
and a seeing woman, I'm thinking, would never wed the like of you.

[She turns away, and the People laugh once more, drawing back a little
and leaving him on their left.]

PEOPLE -- [jeeringly.] -- Try again, Martin, try again, and you'll be
finding her yet.

MARTIN DOUL -- [passionately.] -- Where is it you have her hidden away?
Isn't it a black shame for a drove of pitiful beasts the like of you to
be making game of me, and putting a fool's head on me the grand day
of my life? Ah, you're thinking you're a fine lot, with your giggling,
weeping eyes, a fine lot to be making game of myself and the woman I've
heard called the great wonder of the west.

[During this speech, which he gives with his back towards the church,
Mary Doul has come out with her sight cured, and come down towards the
right with a silly simpering smile, till she is a little behind Martin
Doul.]

MARY DOUL -- [when he pauses.] -- Which of you is Martin Doul?

MARTIN DOUL -- [wheeling round.] -- It's her voice surely. [They stare
at each other blankly.]

MOLLY BYRNE -- [to Martin Doul.] -- Go up now and take her under the
chin and be speaking the way you spoke to myself.

MARTIN DOUL -- [in a low voice, with intensity.] -- If I speak now, I'll
speak hard to the two of you.

MOLLY BYRNE -- [to Mary Doul.] -- You're not saying a word, Mary. What
is it you think of himself, with the fat legs on him, and the little
neck like a ram?

MARY DOUL. I'm thinking it's a poor thing when the Lord God gives you
sight and puts the like of that man in your way.

MARTIN DOUL. It's on your two knees you should be thanking the Lord God
you're not looking on yourself, for if it was yourself you seen you'd
be running round in a short while like the old screeching mad-woman is
running round in the glen.

MARY DOUL -- [beginning to realize herself.] -- If I'm not so fine as
some of them said, I have my hair, and big eyes, and my white skin.

MARTIN DOUL -- [breaking out into a passionate cry.] -- Your hair, and
your big eyes, is it?... I'm telling you there isn't a wisp on any gray
mare on the ridge of the world isn't finer than the dirty twist on your
head. There isn't two eyes in any starving sow isn't finer than the eyes
you were calling blue like the sea.

MARY DOUL -- [interrupting him.] -- It's the devil cured you this
day with your talking of sows; it's the devil cured you this day, I'm
saying, and drove you crazy with lies.

MARTIN DOUL. Isn't it yourself is after playing lies on me, ten years,
in the day and in the night; but what is that to you now the Lord God
has given eyes to me, the way I see you an old wizendy hag, was never
fit to rear a child to me itself.

MARY DOUL. I wouldn't rear a crumpled whelp the like of you. It's many
a woman is married with finer than yourself should be praising God if
she's no child, and isn't loading the earth with things would make the
heavens lonesome above, and they scaring the larks, and the crows, and
the angels passing in the sky.

MARTIN DOUL. Go on now to be seeking a lonesome place where the earth
can hide you away; go on now, I'm saying, or you'll be having men and
women with their knees bled, and they screaming to God for a holy water
would darken their sight, for there's no man but would liefer be blind a
hundred years, or a thousand itself, than to be looking on your like.

MARY DOUL -- [raising her stick.] -- Maybe if I hit you a strong blow
you'd be blind again, and having what you want.

[The Saint is seen in the church door with his head bent in prayer.]

MARTIN DOUL -- [raising his stick and driving Mary Doul back towards
left.] -- Let you keep off from me now if you wouldn't have me strike
out the little handful of brains you have about on the road.

[He is going to strike her, but Timmy catches him by the arm.]

TIMMY. Have you no shame to be making a great row, and the Saint above
saying his prayers?

MARTIN DOUL. What is it I care for the like of him? (Struggling to free
himself). Let me hit her one good one, for the love of the Almighty God,
and I'll be quiet after till I die.

TIMMY -- [shaking him.] -- Will you whisht, I'm saying.

SAINT -- [coming forward, centre.] -- Are their minds troubled with joy,
or is their sight uncertain, the way it does often be the day a person
is restored?

TIMMY. It's too certain their sight is, holy father; and they're after
making a great fight, because they're a pair of pitiful shows.

SAINT -- [coming between them.] -- May the Lord who has given you sight
send a little sense into your heads, the way it won't be on your two
selves you'll be looking -- on two pitiful sinners of the earth -- but
on the splendour of the Spirit of God, you'll see an odd time shining
out through the big hills, and steep streams falling to the sea. For if
it's on the like of that you do be thinking, you'll not be minding
the faces of men, but you'll be saying prayers and great praises, till
you'll be living the way the great saints do be living, with little but
old sacks, and skin covering their bones. (To Timmy.) Leave him go now,
you're seeing he's quiet again. (He frees Martin Doul.) And let you (he
turns to Mary Doul) not be raising your voice, a bad thing in a woman;
but let the lot of you, who have seen the power of the Lord, be thinking
on it in the dark night, and be saying to yourselves it's great pity and
love He has for the poor, starving people of Ireland. (He gathers his
cloak about him.) And now the Lord send blessing to you all, for I am
going on to Annagolan, where there is a deaf woman, and to Laragh,
where there are two men without sense, and to Glenassil, where there are
children blind from their birth; and then I'm going to sleep this night
in the bed of the holy Kevin, and to be prais- ing God, and asking great
blessing on you all. [He bends his head.]

CURTAIN




ACT II

[Village roadside, on left the door of a forge, with broken wheels,
etc., lying about. A well near centre, with board above it, and room to
pass behind it. Martin Doul is sitting near forge, cutting sticks.]

TIMMY -- [heard hammering inside forge, then calls.] -- Let you make
haste out there.... I'll be putting up new fires at the turn of day, and
you haven't the half of them cut yet.

MARTIN DOUL -- [gloomily.] -- It's destroyed I'll be whacking your old
thorns till the turn of day, and I with no food in my stomach would keep
the life in a pig. (He turns towards the door.) Let you come out here
and cut them yourself if you want them cut, for there's an hour every
day when a man has a right to his rest.

TIMMY -- [coming out, with a hammer, impatiently.] -- Do you want me to
be driving you off again to be walking the roads? There you are now, and
I giving you your food, and a corner to sleep, and money with it;
and, to hear the talk of you, you'd think I was after beating you, or
stealing your gold.

MARTIN DOUL. You'd do it handy, maybe, if I'd gold to steal.

TIMMY -- [throws down hammer; picks up some of the sticks already cut,
and throws them into door.] There's no fear of your having gold -- a
lazy, basking fool the like of you.

MARTIN DOUL. No fear, maybe, and I here with yourself, for it's more I
got a while since and I sitting blinded in Grianan, than I get in this
place working hard, and destroying myself, the length of the day.

TIMMY -- [stopping with amazement.] -- Working hard? (He goes over to
him.) I'll teach you to work hard, Martin Doul. Strip off your coat now,
and put a tuck in your sleeves, and cut the lot of them, while I'd
rake the ashes from the forge, or I'll not put up with you another hour
itself.

MARTIN DOUL -- [horrified.] -- Would you have me getting my death
sitting out in the black wintry air with no coat on me at all?

TIMMY -- [with authority.] -- Strip it off now, or walk down upon the
road.

MARTIN DOUL -- [bitterly.] -- Oh, God help me! (He begins taking off
his coat.) I've heard tell you stripped the sheet from your wife and you
putting her down into the grave, and that there isn't the like of you
for plucking your living ducks, the short days, and leaving them running
round in their skins, in the great rains and the cold. (He tucks up his
sleeves.) Ah, I've heard a power of queer things of yourself, and there
isn't one of them I'll not believe from this day, and be telling to the
boys.

TIMMY -- [pulling over a big stick.] -- Let you cut that now, and give
me rest from your talk, for I'm not heeding you at all.

MARTIN DOUL -- [taking stick.] -- That's a hard, terrible stick, Timmy;
and isn't it a poor thing to be cutting strong timber the like of that,
when it's cold the bark is, and slippy with the frost of the air?

TIMMY -- [gathering up another armful of sticks.] -- What way wouldn't
it be cold, and it freezing since the moon was changed? [He goes into
forge.]

MARTIN DOUL -- [querulously, as he cuts slowly.] -- What way, indeed,
Timmy? For it's a raw, beastly day we do have each day, till I do
be thinking it's well for the blind don't be seeing them gray clouds
driving on the hill, and don't be looking on people with their noses
red, the like of your nose, and their eyes weeping and watering, the
like of your eyes, God help you, Timmy the smith.

TIMMY -- [seen blinking in doorway.] -- Is it turning now you are
against your sight?

MARTIN DOUL -- [very miserably.] -- It's a hard thing for a man to have
his sight, and he living near to the like of you (he cuts a stick and
throws it away), or wed with a wife (cuts a stick); and I do be thinking
it should be a hard thing for the Almighty God to be looking on the
world, bad days, and on men the like of yourself walking around on it,
and they slipping each way in the muck.

TIMMY -- [with pot-hooks which he taps on anvil.] -- You'd have a right
to be minding, Martin Doul, for it's a power the Saint cured lose their
sight after a while. Mary Doul's dimming again, I've heard them say;
and I'm thinking the Lord, if he hears you making that talk, will have
little pity left for you at all.

MARTIN DOUL. There's not a bit of fear of me losing my sight, and if
it's a dark day itself it's too well I see every wicked wrinkle you have
round by your eye.

TIMMY -- [looking at him sharply.] -- The day's not dark since the
clouds broke in the east.

MARTIN DOUL. Let you not be tormenting yourself trying to make me
afeard. You told me a power of bad lies the time I was blind, and it's
right now for you to stop, and be taking your rest (Mary Doul comes in
unnoticed on right with a sack filled with green stuff on her arm),
for it's little ease or quiet any person would get if the big fools of
Ireland weren't weary at times. (He looks up and sees Mary Doul.) Oh,
glory be to God, she's coming again.

[He begins to work busily with his back to her.]

TIMMY -- [amused, to Mary Doul, as she is going by without looking at
them.] -- Look on him now, Mary Doul. You'd be a great one for keeping
him steady at his work, for he's after idling and blathering to this
hour from the dawn of day.

MARY DOUL -- [stiffly.] -- Of what is it you're speaking, Timmy the
smith?

TIMMY -- [laughing.] -- Of himself, surely. Look on him there, and he
with the shirt on him ripping from his back. You'd have a right to come
round this night, I'm thinking, and put a stitch into his clothes, for
it's long enough you are not speaking one to the other.

MARY DOUL. Let the two of you not torment me at all.

[She goes out left, with her head in the air.]

MARTIN DOUL -- [stops work and looks after her.] -- Well, isn't it a
queer thing she can't keep herself two days without looking on my face?

TIMMY -- [jeeringly.] -- Looking on your face is it? And she after going
by with her head turned the way you'd see a priest going where there'd
be a drunken man in the side ditch talking with a girl. (Martin Doul
gets up and goes to corner of forge, and looks out left.) Come back here
and don't mind her at all. Come back here, I'm saying, you've no call
to be spying behind her since she went off, and left you, in place of
breaking her heart, trying to keep you in the decency of clothes and
food.

MARTIN DOUL -- [crying out indignantly.] -- You know rightly, Timmy, it
was myself drove her away.

TIMMY. That's a lie you're telling, yet it's little I care which one of
you was driving the other, and let you walk back here, I'm saying, to
your work.

MARTIN DOUL -- [turning round.] -- I'm coming, surely.

[He stops and looks out right, going a step or two towards centre.]

TIMMY. On what is it you're gaping, Martin Doul?

MARTIN DOUL. There's a person walking above.... It's Molly Byrne, I'm
thinking, coming down with her can.

TIMMY. If she is itself let you not be idling this day, or minding her
at all, and let you hurry with them sticks, for I'll want you in a short
while to be blowing in the forge. [He throws down pot-hooks.]

MARTIN DOUL -- [crying out.] -- Is it roasting me now you'd be? (Turns
back and sees pot-hooks; he takes them up.) Pot-hooks? Is it over them
you've been inside sneezing and sweating since the dawn of day?

TIMMY -- [resting himself on anvil, with satisfaction.] -- I'm making
a power of things you do have when you're settling with a wife, Martin
Doul; for I heard tell last night the Saint'll be passing again in a
short while, and I'd have him wed Molly with myself.... He'd do it, I've
heard them say, for not a penny at all.

MARTIN DOUL -- [lays down hooks and looks at him steadily.] -- Molly'll
be saying great praises now to the Almighty God and He giving her a
fine, stout, hardy man the like of you.

TIMMY -- [uneasily.] -- And why wouldn't she, if she's a fine woman
itself?

MARTIN DOUL -- [looking up right.] -- Why wouldn't she, indeed,
Timmy?.... The Almighty God's made a fine match in the two of you, for
if you went marrying a woman was the like of yourself you'd be having
the fearfullest little children, I'm thinking, was ever seen in the
world.

TIMMY -- [seriously offended.] -- God forgive you! if you're an ugly man
to be looking at, I'm thinking your tongue's worse than your view.

MARTIN DOUL -- [hurt also.] -- Isn't it destroyed with the cold I
am, and if I'm ugly itself I never seen anyone the like of you for
dreepiness this day, Timmy the smith, and I'm thinking now herself's
coming above you'd have a right to step up into your old shanty, and
give a rub to your face, and not be sitting there with your bleary eyes,
and your big nose, the like of an old scarecrow stuck down upon the
road.

TIMMY -- [looking up the road uneasily.] She's no call to mind what way
I look, and I after building a house with four rooms in it above on the
hill. (He stands up.) But it's a queer thing the way yourself and Mary
Doul are after setting every person in this place, and up beyond to
Rathvanna, talking of nothing, and thinking of nothing, but the way they
do be looking in the face. (Going towards forge.) It's the devil's
work you're after doing with your talk of fine looks, and I'd do right,
maybe, to step in and wash the blackness from my eyes.

[He goes into forge. Martin Doul rubs his face furtively with the tail
of his coat. Molly Byrne comes on right with a water-can, and begins to
fill it at the well.]

MARTIN DOUL. God save you, Molly Byrne.

MOLLY BYRNE -- [indifferently.] -- God save you.

MARTIN DOUL. That's a dark, gloomy day, and the Lord have mercy on us
all.

MOLLY BYRNE. Middling dark.

MARTIN DOUL. It's a power of dirty days, and dark mornings, and
shabby-looking fellows (he makes a gesture over his shoulder) we do have
to be looking on when we have our sight, God help us, but there's one
fine thing we have, to be looking on a grand, white, handsome girl, the
like of you.... and every time I set my eyes on you I do be blessing the
saints, and the holy water, and the power of the Lord Almighty in the
heavens above.

MOLLY BYRNE. I've heard the priests say it isn't looking on a young girl
would teach many to be saying their prayers. [Bailing water into her can
with a cup.]

MARTIN DOUL. It isn't many have been the way I was, hearing your voice
speaking, and not seeing you at all.

MOLLY BYRNE. That should have been a queer time for an old, wicked,
coaxing fool to be sitting there with your eyes shut, and not seeing a
sight of girl or woman passing the road.

MARTIN DOUL. If it was a queer time itself it was great joy and pride
I had the time I'd hear your voice speaking and you passing to Grianan
(beginning to speak with plaintive intensity), for it's of many a fine
thing your voice would put a poor dark fellow in mind, and the day I'd
hear it it's of little else at all I would be thinking.

MOLLY BYRNE. I'll tell your wife if you talk to me the like of that....
You've heard, maybe, she's below picking nettles for the widow O'Flinn,
who took great pity on her when she seen the two of you fighting, and
yourself putting shame on her at the crossing of the roads.

MARTIN DOUL -- [impatiently.] -- Is there no living person can speak a
score of words to me, or say "God speed you," itself, without putting me
in mind of the old woman, or that day either at Grianan?

MOLLY BYRNE -- [maliciously.] -- I was thinking it should be a fine
thing to put you in mind of the day you called the grand day of your
life.

MARTIN DOUL. Grand day, is it? (Plaintively again, throwing aside his
work, and leaning towards her.) Or a bad black day when I was roused up
and found I was the like of the little children do be listening to the
stories of an old woman, and do be dreaming after in the dark night that
it's in grand houses of gold they are, with speckled horses to ride, and
do be waking again, in a short while, and they destroyed with the cold,
and the thatch dripping, maybe, and the starved ass braying in the yard?

MOLLY BYRNE -- [working indifferently.] -- You've great romancing this
day, Martin Doul. Was it up at the still you were at the fall of night?

MARTIN DOUL -- [stands up, comes towards her, but stands at far (right)
side of well.] -- It was not, Molly Byrne, but lying down in a little
rickety shed.... Lying down across a sop of straw, and I thinking I was
seeing you walk, and hearing the sound of your step on a dry road, and
hearing you again, and you laughing and making great talk in a high room
with dry timber lining the roof. For it's a fine sound your voice has
that time, and it's better I am, I'm thinking, lying down, the way
a blind man does be lying, than to be sitting here in the gray light
taking hard words of Timmy the smith.

MOLLY BYRNE -- [looking at him with interest.] -- It's queer talk you
have if it's a little, old, shabby stump of a man you are itself.

MARTIN DOUL. I'm not so old as you do hear them say.

MOLLY BYRNE. You're old, I'm thinking, to be talking that talk with a
girl.

MARTIN DOUL -- [despondingly.] -- It's not a lie you're telling, maybe,
for it's long years I'm after losing from the world, feeling love and
talking love, with the old woman, and I fooled the whole while with the
lies of Timmy the smith.

MOLLY BYRNE -- [half invitingly.] -- It's a fine way you're wanting to
pay Timmy the smith.... And it's not his LIES you're making love to this
day, Martin Doul.

MARTIN DOUL. It is not, Molly, and the Lord forgive us all. (He passes
behind her and comes near her left.) For I've heard tell there are lands
beyond in Cahir Iveraghig and the Reeks of Cork with warm sun in them,
and fine light in the sky. (Bending towards her.) And light's a grand
thing for a man ever was blind, or a woman, with a fine neck, and a skin
on her the like of you, the way we'd have a right to go off this day
till we'd have a fine life passing abroad through them towns of the
south, and we telling stories, maybe, or singing songs at the fairs.

MOLLY BYRNE -- [turning round half amused, and looking him over from
head to foot.] -- Well, isn't it a queer thing when your own wife's
after leaving you because you're a pitiful show, you'd talk the like of
that to me?

MARTIN DOUL -- [drawing back a little, hurt, but indignant.] -- It's
a queer thing, maybe, for all things is queer in the world. (In a low
voice with peculiar emphasis.) But there's one thing I'm telling you,
if she walked off away from me, it wasn't because of seeing me, and I no
more than I am, but because I was looking on her with my two eyes, and
she getting up, and eating her food, and combing her hair, and lying
down for her sleep.

MOLLY BYRNE -- [interested, off her guard.] -- Wouldn't any married man
you'd have be doing the like of that?

MARTIN DOUL -- [seizing the moment that he has her attention.] -- I'm
thinking by the mercy of God it's few sees anything but them is blind
for a space (with excitement.) It's a few sees the old woman rotting for
the grave, and it's few sees the like of yourself. (He bends over her.)
Though it's shining you are, like a high lamp would drag in the ships
out of the sea.

MOLLY BYRNE -- [shrinking away from him.] -- Keep off from me, Martin
Doul.

MARTIN DOUL -- [quickly, with low, furious intensity.] -- It's the truth
I'm telling you. (He puts his hand on her shoulder and shakes her.) And
you'd do right not to marry a man is after looking out a long while on
the bad days of the world; for what way would the like of him have fit
eyes to look on yourself, when you rise up in the morning and come out
of the little door you have above in the lane, the time it'd be a fine
thing if a man would be seeing, and losing his sight, the way he'd have
your two eyes facing him, and he going the roads, and shining above him,
and he looking in the sky, and springing up from the earth, the time
he'd lower his head, in place of the muck that seeing men do meet all
roads spread on the world.

MOLLY BYRNE -- [who has listened half mesmerized, starting away.] --
It's the like of that talk you'd hear from a man would be losing his
mind.

MARTIN DOUL -- [going after her, passing to her right.] -- It'd be
little wonder if a man near the like of you would be losing his mind.
Put down your can now, and come along with myself, for I'm seeing you
this day, seeing you, maybe, the way no man has seen you in the world.
(He takes her by the arm and tries to pull her away softly to the
right.) Let you come on now, I'm saying, to the lands of Iveragh and the
Reeks of Cork, where you won't set down the width of your two feet and
not be crushing fine flowers, and making sweet smells in the air.

MOLLY BYRNE -- [laying down the can; trying to free herself.] -- Leave
me go, Martin Doul! Leave me go, I'm saying!

MARTIN DOUL. Let you not be fooling. Come along now the little path
through the trees.

MOLLY BYRNE -- [crying out towards forge.] -- Timmy the smith. (Timmy
comes out of forge, and Martin Doul lets her go. Molly Byrne, excited
and breathless, pointing to Martin Doul.) Did ever you hear that them
that loses their sight loses their senses along with it, Timmy the
smith!

TIMMY -- [suspicious, but uncertain.] -- He's no sense, surely, and
he'll be having himself driven off this day from where he's good
sleeping, and feeding, and wages for his work.

MOLLY BYRNE -- [as before.] -- He's a bigger fool than that, Timmy. Look
on him now, and tell me if that isn't a grand fellow to think he's only
to open his mouth to have a fine woman, the like of me, running along by
his heels.

[Martin Doul recoils towards centre, with his hand to his eyes; Mary
Doul is seen on left coming forward softly.]

TIMMY -- [with blank amazement.] -- Oh, the blind is wicked people, and
it's no lie. But he'll walk off this day and not be troubling us more.

[Turns back left and picks up Martin Doul's coat and stick; some things
fall out of coat pocket, which he gathers up again.]

MARTIN DOUL -- [turns around, sees Mary Doul, whispers to Molly Byrne
with imploring agony.] -- Let you not put shame on me, Molly, before
herself and the smith. Let you not put shame on me and I after saying
fine words to you, and dreaming... dreams... in the night. (He
hesitates, and looks round the sky.) Is it a storm of thunder is coming,
or the last end of the world? (He staggers towards Mary Doul, tripping
slightly over tin can.) The heavens is closing, I'm thinking, with
darkness and great trouble passing in the sky. (He reaches Mary Doul,
and seizes her left arm with both his hands -- with a frantic cry.) Is
it darkness of thunder is coming, Mary Doul! Do you see me clearly with
your eyes?

MARY DOUL -- [snatches her arm away, and hits him with empty sack across
the face.] -- I see you a sight too clearly, and let you keep off from
me now.

MOLLY BYRNE -- [clapping her hands.] -- That's right, Mary. That's the
way to treat the like of him is after standing there at my feet and
asking me to go off with him, till I'd grow an old wretched road-woman
the like of yourself.

MARY DOUL -- [defiantly.] -- When the skin shrinks on your chin, Molly
Byrne, there won't be the like of you for a shrunk hag in the four
quarters of Ireland.... It's a fine pair you'd be, surely!

[Martin Doul is standing at back right centre, with his back to the
audience.]

TIMMY -- [coming over to Mary Doul.] -- Is it no shame you have to let
on she'd ever be the like of you?

MARY DOUL. It's them that's fat and flabby do be wrinkled young, and
that whitish yellowy hair she has does be soon turning the like of a
handful of thin grass you'd see rotting, where the wet lies, at the
north of a sty. (Turning to go out on right.) Ah, it's a better thing to
have a simple, seemly face, the like of my face, for two-score years, or
fifty itself, than to be setting fools mad a short while, and then to be
turning a thing would drive off the little children from your feet.

[She goes out; Martin Doul has come forward again, mastering himself,
but uncertain.]

TIMMY. Oh, God protect us, Molly, from the words of the blind. (He
throws down Martin Doul's coat and stick.) There's your old rubbish now,
Martin Doul, and let you take it up, for it's all you have, and walk off
through the world, for if ever I meet you coming again, if it's seeing
or blind you are itself, I'll bring out the big hammer and hit you a
welt with it will leave you easy till the judgment day.

MARTIN DOUL -- [rousing himself with an effort.] -- What call have you
to talk the like of that with myself?

TIMMY -- [pointing to Molly Byrne.] -- It's well you know what call
I have. It's well you know a decent girl, I'm thinking to wed, has no
right to have her heart scalded with hearing talk -- and queer, bad
talk, I'm thinking -- from a raggy-looking fool the like of you.

MARTIN DOUL -- [raising his voice.] -- It's making game of you she is,
for what seeing girl would marry with yourself? Look on him, Molly, look
on him, I'm saying, for I'm seeing him still, and let you raise your
voice, for the time is come, and bid him go up into his forge, and
be sitting there by himself, sneezing and sweating, and he beating
pot-hooks till the judgment day. [He seizes her arm again.]

MOLLY BYRNE. Keep him off from me, Timmy!

TIMMY -- [pushing Martin Doul aside.] -- Would you have me strike you,
Martin Doul? Go along now after your wife, who's a fit match for you,
and leave Molly with myself.

MARTIN DOUL -- [despairingly.] -- Won't you raise your voice, Molly, and
lay hell's long curse on his tongue?

MOLLY BYRNE -- [on Timmy's left.] -- I'll be telling him it's destroyed
I am with the sight of you and the sound of your voice. Go off now after
your wife, and if she beats you again, let you go after the tinker girls
is above running the hills, or down among the sluts of the town,
and you'll learn one day, maybe, the way a man should speak with a
well-reared, civil girl the like of me. (She takes Timmy by the arm.)
Come up now into the forge till he'll be gone down a bit on the road,
for it's near afeard I am of the wild look he has come in his eyes.

[She goes into the forge. Timmy stops in the doorway.]

TIMMY. Let me not find you out here again, Martin Doul. (He bares his
arm.) It's well you know Timmy the smith has great strength in his arm,
and it's a power of things it has broken a sight harder than the old
bone of your skull.

[He goes into the forge and pulls the door after him.]

MARTIN DOUL -- [stands a moment with his hand to his eyes.] -- And
that's the last thing I'm to set my sight on in the life of the world --
the villainy of a woman and the bloody strength of a man. Oh, God, pity
a poor, blind fellow, the way I am this day with no strength in me to do
hurt to them at all. (He begins groping about for a moment, then stops.)
Yet if I've no strength in me I've a voice left for my prayers, and may
God blight them this day, and my own soul the same hour with them, the
way I'll see them after, Molly Byrne and Timmy the smith, the two of
them on a high bed, and they screeching in hell.... It'll be a grand
thing that time to look on the two of them; and they twisting and
roaring out, and twisting and roaring again, one day and the next day,
and each day always and ever. It's not blind I'll be that time, and it
won't be hell to me, I'm thinking, but the like of heaven itself; and
it's fine care I'll be taking the Lord Almighty doesn't know. [He turns
to grope out.]

CURTAIN




ACT III

[The same Scene as in first Act, but gap in centre has been filled with
briars, or branches of some sort. Mary Doul, blind again, gropes her way
in on left, and sits as before. She has a few rushes with her. It is an
early spring day.]

MARY DOUL -- [mournfully.] -- Ah, God help me... God help me; the
blackness wasn't so black at all the other time as it is this time, and
it's destroyed I'll be now, and hard set to get my living working alone,
when it's few are passing and the winds are cold. (She begins shredding
rushes.) I'm thinking short days will be long days to me from this
time, and I sitting here, not seeing a blink, or hearing a word, and no
thought in my mind but long prayers that Martin Doul'll get his reward
in a short while for the villainy of his heart. It's great jokes the
people'll be making now, I'm thinking, and they pass me by, pointing
their fingers maybe, and asking what place is himself, the way it's no
quiet or decency I'll have from this day till I'm an old woman with long
white hair and it twisting from my brow. (She fumbles with her hair, and
then seems to hear something. Listens for a moment.) There's a queer,
slouching step coming on the road... . God help me, he's coming surely.

[She stays perfectly quiet. Martin Doul gropes in on right, blind also.]

MARTIN DOUL -- [gloomily.] -- The devil mend Mary Doul for putting lies
on me, and letting on she was grand. The devil mend the old Saint for
letting me see it was lies. (He sits down near her.) The devil mend
Timmy the smith for killing me with hard work, and keeping me with an
empty, windy stomach in me, in the day and in the night. Ten thousand
devils mend the soul of Molly Byrne -- (Mary Doul nods her head with
approval.) -- and the bad, wicked souls is hidden in all the women
of the world. (He rocks himself, with his hand over his face.) It's
lonesome I'll be from this day, and if living people is a bad lot, yet
Mary Doul, herself, and she a dirty, wrinkled-looking hag, was better
maybe to be sitting along with than no one at all. I'll be getting my
death now, I'm thinking, sitting alone in the cold air, hearing the
night coming, and the blackbirds flying round in the briars crying to
themselves, the time you'll hear one cart getting off a long way in the
east, and another cart getting off a long way in the west, and a dog
barking maybe, and a little wind turning the sticks. (He listens and
sighs heavily.) I'll be destroyed sitting alone and losing my senses
this time the way I'm after losing my sight, for it'd make any person
afeard to be sitting up hearing the sound of his breath -- (he moves his
feet on the stones) -- and the noise of his feet, when it's a power
of queer things do be stirring, little sticks breaking, and the grass
moving -- (Mary Doul half sighs, and he turns on her in horror) -- till
you'd take your dying oath on sun and moon a thing was breathing on the
stones. (He listens towards her for a moment, then starts up nervously,
and gropes about for his stick.) I'll be going now, I'm thinking, but
I'm not sure what place my stick's in, and I'm destroyed with terror
and dread. (He touches her face as he is groping about and cries out.)
There's a thing with a cold, living face on it sitting up at my side.
(He turns to run away, but misses his path and stumbles in against the
wall.) My road is lost on me now! Oh, merciful God, set my foot on the
path this day, and I'll be saying prayers morning and night, and not
straining my ear after young girls, or doing any bad thing till I die.

MARY DOUL -- [indignantly.] -- Let you not be telling lies to the
Almighty God.

MARTIN DOUL. Mary Doul, is it? (Recovering himself with immense relief.)
Is it Mary Doul, I'm saying?

MARY DOUL. There's a sweet tone in your voice I've not heard for a
space. You're taking me for Molly Byrne, I'm thinking.

MARTIN DOUL -- [coming towards her, wiping sweat from his face.] --
Well, sight's a queer thing for upsetting a man. It's a queer thing to
think I'd live to this day to be fearing the like of you; but if it's
shaken I am for a short while, I'll soon be coming to myself.

MARY DOUL. You'll be grand then, and it's no lie.

MARTIN DOUL -- [sitting down shyly, some way off.] -- You've no call to
be talking, for I've heard tell you're as blind as myself.

MARY DOUL. If I am I'm bearing in mind I'm married to a little dark
stump of a fellow looks the fool of the world, and I'll be bearing in
mind from this day the great hullabuloo he's after making from hearing a
poor woman breathing quiet in her place.

MARTIN DOUL. And you'll be bearing in mind, I'm thinking, what you seen
a while back when you looked down into a well, or a clear pool, maybe,
when there was no wind stirring and a good light in the sky.

MARY DOUL. I'm minding that surely, for if I'm not the way the liars
were saying below I seen a thing in them pools put joy and blessing in
my heart. [She puts her hand to her hair again.]

MARTIN DOUL -- [laughing ironically.] -- Well, they were saying below
I was losing my senses, but I never went any day the length of that....
God help you, Mary Doul, if you're not a wonder for looks, you're the
maddest female woman is walking the counties of the east.

MARY DOUL -- [scornfully.] You were saying all times you'd a great ear
for hearing the lies of the world. A great ear, God help you, and you
think you're using it now.

MARTIN DOUL. If it's not lies you're telling would you have me think
you're not a wrinkled poor woman is looking like three scores, or two
scores and a half!

MARY DOUL. I would not, Martin. (She leans forward earnestly.) For when
I seen myself in them pools, I seen my hair would be gray or white,
maybe, in a short while, and I seen with it that I'd a face would be a
great wonder when it'll have soft white hair falling around it, the way
when I'm an old woman there won't be the like of me surely in the seven
counties of the east.

MARTIN DOUL -- [with real admiration.] -- You're a cute thinking woman,
Mary Doul, and it's no lie.

MARY DOUL -- [triumphantly.] -- I am, surely, and I'm telling you a
beautiful white-haired woman is a grand thing to see, for I'm told when
Kitty Bawn was selling poteen below, the young men itself would never
tire to be looking in her face.

MARTIN DOUL -- [taking off his hat and feeling his head, speaking with
hesitation.] -- Did you think to look, Mary Doul, would there be a
whiteness the like of that coming upon me?

MARY DOUL -- [with extreme contempt.] -- On you, God help you!... In a
short while you'll have a head on you as bald as an old turnip you'd see
rolling round in the muck. You need never talk again of your fine looks,
Martin Doul, for the day of that talk's gone for ever.

MARTIN DOUL. That's a hard word to be saying, for I was thinking if I'd
a bit of comfort, the like of yourself, it's not far off we'd be from
the good days went before, and that'd be a wonder surely. But I'll never
rest easy, thinking you're a gray, beautiful woman, and myself a pitiful
show.

MARY DOUL. I can't help your looks, Martin Doul. It wasn't myself made
you with your rat's eyes, and your big ears, and your griseldy chin.

MARTIN DOUL -- [rubs his chin ruefully, then beams with delight.] --
There's one thing you've forgot, if you're a cute thinking woman itself.

MARY DOUL. Your slouching feet, is it? Or your hooky neck, or your two
knees is black with knocking one on the other?

MARTIN DOUL -- [with delighted scorn.] -- There's talking for a cute
woman. There's talking, surely!

MARY DOUL -- [puzzled at joy of his voice.] -- If you'd anything but
lies to say you'd be talking to yourself.

MARTIN DOUL -- [bursting with excitement.] -- I've this to say, Mary
Doul. I'll be letting my beard grow in a short while, a beautiful,
long, white, silken, streamy beard, you wouldn't see the like of in the
eastern world.... Ah, a white beard's a grand thing on an old man, a
grand thing for making the quality stop and be stretching out their
hands with good silver or gold, and a beard's a thing you'll never have,
so you may be holding your tongue.

MARY DOUL -- [laughing cheerfully.] -- Well, we're a great pair, surely,
and it's great times we'll have yet, maybe, and great talking before we
die.

MARTIN DOUL. Great times from this day, with the help of the Almighty
God, for a priest itself would believe the lies of an old man would have
a fine white beard growing on his chin.

MARY DOUL. There's the sound of one of them twittering yellow birds do
be coming in the spring-time from beyond the sea, and there'll be a fine
warmth now in the sun, and a sweetness in the air, the way it'll be
a grand thing to be sitting here quiet and easy smelling the things
growing up, and budding from the earth.

MARTIN DOUL. I'm smelling the furze a while back sprouting on the hill,
and if you'd hold your tongue you'd hear the lambs of Grianan, though
it's near drowned their crying is with the full river making noises in
the glen.

MARY DOUL -- [listens.] -- The lambs is bleating, surely, and there's
cocks and laying hens making a fine stir a mile off on the face of the
hill. (She starts.)

MARTIN DOUL. What's that is sounding in the west? [A faint sound of a
bell is heard.]

MARY DOUL. It's not the churches, for the wind's blowing from the sea.

MARTIN DOUL -- [with dismay.] -- It's the old Saint, I'm thinking,
ringing his bell.

MARY DOUL. The Lord protect us from the saints of God! (They listen.)
He's coming this road, surely.

MARTIN DOUL -- [tentatively.] -- Will we be running off, Mary Doul?

MARY DOUL. What place would we run?

MARTIN DOUL. There's the little path going up through the sloughs....
If we reached the bank above, where the elders do be growing, no person
would see a sight of us, if it was a hundred yeomen were passing itself;
but I'm afeard after the time we were with our sight we'll not find our
way to it at all.

MARY DOUL -- [standing up.] -- You'd find the way, surely. You're a
grand man the world knows at finding your way winter or summer, if there
was deep snow in it itself, or thick grass and leaves, maybe, growing
from the earth.

MARTIN DOUL -- [taking her hand.] -- Come a bit this way; it's here it
begins. (They grope about gap.) There's a tree pulled into the gap, or a
strange thing happened, since I was passing it before.

MARY DOUL. Would we have a right to be crawling in below under the
sticks?

MARTIN DOUL. It's hard set I am to know what would be right. And isn't
it a poor thing to be blind when you can't run off itself, and you
fearing to see?

MARY DOUL -- [nearly in tears.] -- It's a poor thing, God help us, and
what good'll our gray hairs be itself, if we have our sight, the way
we'll see them falling each day, and turning dirty in the rain?

[The bell sounds nearby.]

MARTIN DOUL -- [in despair.] -- He's coming now, and we won't get off
from him at all.

MARY DOUL. Could we hide in the bit of a briar is growing at the west
butt of the church?

MARTIN DOUL. We'll try that, surely. (He listens a moment.) Let you make
haste; I hear them trampling in the wood. [They grope over to church.]

MARY DOUL. It's the words of the young girls making a great stir in the
trees. (They find the bush.) Here's the briar on my left, Martin; I'll
go in first, I'm the big one, and I'm easy to see.

MARTIN DOUL -- [turning his head anxiously.] -- It's easy heard you are;
and will you be holding your tongue?

MARY DOUL -- [partly behind bush.] -- Come in now beside of me. (They
kneel down, still clearly visible.) Do you think they can see us now,
Martin Doul?

MARTIN DOUL. I'm thinking they can't, but I'm hard set to know; for the
lot of them young girls, the devil save them, have sharp, terrible eyes,
would pick out a poor man, I'm thinking, and he lying below hid in his
grave.

MARY DOUL. Let you not be whispering sin, Martin Doul, or maybe it's the
finger of God they'd see pointing to ourselves.

MARTIN DOUL. It's yourself is speaking madness, Mary Doul; haven't you
heard the Saint say it's the wicked do be blind?

MARY DOUL. If it is you'd have a right to speak a big, terrible word
would make the water not cure us at all.

MARTIN DOUL. What way would I find a big, terrible word, and I shook
with the fear; and if I did itself, who'd know rightly if it's good
words or bad would save us this day from himself?

MARY DOUL. They're coming. I hear their feet on the stones.

[The Saint comes in on right, with Timmy and Molly Byrne in holiday
clothes, the others as before.]

TIMMY. I've heard tell Martin Doul and Mary Doul were seen this day
about on the road, holy father, and we were thinking you'd have pity on
them and cure them again.

SAINT. I would, maybe, but where are they at all? I have little time
left when I have the two of you wed in the church.

MAT SIMON -- [at their seat.] -- There are the rushes they do have lying
round on the stones. It's not far off they'll be, surely.

MOLLY BYRNE -- [pointing with astonishment.] -- Look beyond, Timmy.
[They all look over and see Martin Doul.]

TIMMY. Well, Martin's a lazy fellow to be lying in there at the height
of the day. (He goes over shouting.) Let you get up out of that. You
were near losing a great chance by your sleepiness this day, Martin
Doul.... The two of them's in it, God help us all!

MARTIN DOUL -- [scrambling up with Mary Doul.] -- What is it you want,
Timmy, that you can't leave us in peace?

TIMMY. The Saint's come to marry the two of us, and I'm after speaking
a word for yourselves, the way he'll be curing you now; for if you're a
foolish man itself, I do be pitying you, for I've a kind heart, when
I think of you sitting dark again, and you after seeing a while and
working for your bread. [Martin Doul takes Mary Doul's hand and tries to
grope his way off right; he has lost his hat, and they are both covered
with dust and grass seeds.]

PEOPLE. You're going wrong. It's this way, Martin Doul.

[They push him over in front of the Saint, near centre. Martin Doul and
Mary Doul stand with piteous hang-dog dejection.]

SAINT. Let you not be afeard, for there's great pity with the Lord.

MARTIN DOUL. We aren't afeard, holy father.

SAINT. It's many a time those that are cured with the well of the four
beauties of God lose their sight when a time is gone, but those I cure
a second time go on seeing till the hour of death. (He takes the cover
from his can.) I've a few drops only left of the water, but, with the
help of God, It'll be enough for the two of you, and let you kneel down
now upon the road. [Martin Doul wheels round with Mary Doul and tries to
get away.]

SAINT. You can kneel down here, I'm saying, we'll not trouble this time
going to the church.

TIMMY -- [turning Martin Doul round, angrily.] -- Are you going mad in
your head, Martin Doul? It's here you're to kneel. Did you not hear his
reverence, and he speaking to you now?

SAINT. Kneel down, I'm saying, the ground's dry at your feet.

MARTIN DOUL -- [with distress.] -- Let you go on your own way, holy
father. We're not calling you at all.

SAINT. I'm not saying a word of penance, or fasting itself, for I'm
thinking the Lord has brought you great teaching in the blindness of
your eyes; so you've no call now to be fearing me, but let you kneel
down till I give you your sight.

MARTIN DOUL -- [more troubled.] -- We're not asking our sight, holy
father, and let you walk on your own way, and be fasting, or praying,
or doing anything that you will, but leave us here in our peace, at
the crossing of the roads, for it's best we are this way, and we're not
asking to see.

SAINT -- [to the People.] -- Is his mind gone that he's no wish to be
cured this day, or to be living or working, or looking on the wonders of
the world?

MARTIN DOUL. It's wonders enough I seen in a short space for the life of
one man only.

SAINT -- [severely.] -- I never heard tell of any person wouldn't have
great joy to be looking on the earth, and the image of the Lord thrown
upon men.

MARTIN DOUL -- [raising his voice.] -- Them is great sights, holy
father.... What was it I seen when I first opened my eyes but your own
bleeding feet, and they cut with the stones? That was a great sight,
maybe, of the image of God.... And what was it I seen my last day but
the villainy of hell looking out from the eyes of the girl you're coming
to marry -- the Lord forgive you -- with Timmy the smith. That was a
great sight, maybe. And wasn't it great sights I seen on the roads when
the north winds would be driving, and the skies would be harsh, till
you'd see the horses and the asses, and the dogs itself, maybe, with
their heads hanging, and they closing their eyes --.

SAINT. And did you never hear tell of the summer, and the fine spring,
and the places where the holy men of Ireland have built up churches to
the Lord? No man isn't a madman, I'm thinking, would be talking the like
of that, and wishing to be closed up and seeing no sight of the grand
glittering seas, and the furze that is opening above, and will soon have
the hills shining as if it was fine creels of gold they were, rising to
the sky.

MARTIN DOUL. Is it talking now you are of Knock and Ballavore? Ah, it's
ourselves had finer sights than the like of them, I'm telling you, when
we were sitting a while back hearing the birds and bees humming in every
weed of the ditch, or when we'd be smelling the sweet, beautiful smell
does be rising in the warm nights, when you do hear the swift flying
things racing in the air, till we'd be looking up in our own minds into
a grand sky, and seeing lakes, and big rivers, and fine hills for taking
the plough.

SAINT -- [to People.] -- There's little use talking with the like of
him.

MOLLY BYRNE. It's lazy he is, holy father, and not wanting to work; for
a while before you had him cured he was always talking, and wishing, and
longing for his sight.

MARTIN DOUL -- [turning on her.] -- I was longing, surely for sight; but
I seen my fill in a short while with the look of my wife, and the look
of yourself, Molly Byrne, when you'd the queer wicked grin in your eyes
you do have the time you're making game with a man.

MOLLY BYRNE. Let you not mind him, holy father; for it's bad things
he was saying to me a while back -- bad things for a married man, your
reverence -- and you'd do right surely to leave him in darkness, if it's
that is best fitting the villainy of his heart.

TIMMY -- [to Saint.] -- Would you cure Mary Doul, your reverence, who is
a quiet poor woman, never did hurt to any, or said a hard word, saving
only when she'd be vexed with himself, or with young girls would be
making game of her below?

SAINT -- [to Mary Doul.] -- If you have any sense, Mary, kneel down at
my feet, and I'll bring the sight again into your eyes.

MARTIN DOUL -- [more defiantly.] -- You will not, holy father. Would you
have her looking on me, and saying hard words to me, till the hour of
death?

SAINT -- [severely.] -- If she's wanting her sight I wouldn't have the
like of you stop her at all. (To Mary Doul.) Kneel down, I'm saying.

MARY DOUL -- [doubtfully.] -- Let us be as we are, holy father, and then
we'll be known again in a short while as the people is happy and blind,
and be having an easy time, with no trouble to live, and we getting
halfpence on the road.

MOLLY BYRNE. Let you not be a raving fool, Mary Doul. Kneel down now,
and let him give you your sight, and himself can be sitting here if he
likes it best, and taking halfpence on the road.

TIMMY. That's the truth, Mary; and if it's choosing a wilful blindness
you are, I'm thinking there isn't anyone in this place will ever be
giving you a hand's turn or a hap'orth of meal, or be doing the little
things you need to keep you at all living in the world.

MAT SIMON. If you had your sight, Mary, you could be walking up for him
and down with him, and be stitching his clothes, and keeping a watch on
him day and night the way no other woman would come near him at all.

MARY DOUL -- [half persuaded.] -- That's the truth, maybe.

SAINT. Kneel down now, I'm saying, for it's in haste I am to be going on
with the marriage and be walking my own way before the fall of night.

THE PEOPLE. Kneel down, Mary! Kneel down when you're bid by the Saint!

MARY DOUL -- [looking uneasily towards Martin Doul.] -- Maybe it's right
they are, and I will if you wish it, holy father.

[She kneels down. The Saint takes off his hat and gives it to some one
near him. All the men take off their hats. He goes forward a step to
take Martin Doul's hand away from Mary Doul.]

SAINT -- [to Martin Doul.] -- Go aside now; we're not wanting you here.

MARTIN DOUL -- [pushes him away roughly, and stands with his left hand
on Mary Doul's shoulder.] -- Keep off yourself, holy father, and let you
not be taking my rest from me in the darkness of my wife.... What call
has the like of you to be coming between married people -- that you're
not understanding at all -- and be making a great mess with the holy
water you have, and the length of your prayers? Go on now, I'm saying,
and leave us here on the road.

SAINT. If it was a seeing man I heard talking to me the like of that I'd
put a black curse on him would weigh down his soul till it'd be falling
to hell; but you're a poor blind sinner, God forgive you, and I don't
mind you at all. (He raises his can.) Go aside now till I give the
blessing to your wife, and if you won't go with your own will, there are
those standing by will make you, surely.

MARTIN DOUL -- [pulling Mary Doul.] -- Come along now, and don't mind
him at all.

SAINT -- [imperiously, to the People.] -- Let you take that man and
drive him down upon the road. [Some men seize Martin Doul.]

MARTIN DOUL -- [struggling and shouting.] -- Make them leave me go, holy
father! Make them leave me go, I'm saying, and you may cure her this
day, or do anything that you will.

SAINT -- [to People.] -- Let him be..... Let him be if his sense is come
to him at all.

MARTIN DOUL -- [shakes himself loose, feels for Mary Doul, sinking
his voice to a plausible whine.] -- You may cure herself, surely, holy
father; I wouldn't stop you at all -- and it's great joy she'll have
looking on your face -- but let you cure myself along with her, the way
I'll see when it's lies she's telling, and be looking out day and night
upon the holy men of God.

[He kneels down a little before Mary Doul.]

SAINT -- [speaking half to the People.] -- Men who are dark a long while
and thinking over queer thoughts in their heads, aren't the like of
simple men, who do be working every day, and praying, and living like
ourselves; so if he has found a right mind at the last minute itself,
I'll cure him, if the Lord will, and not be thinking of the hard,
foolish words he's after saying this day to us all.

MARTIN DOUL -- [listening eagerly.] -- I'm waiting now, holy father.

SAINT -- [with can in his hand, close to Martin Doul.] -- With the power
of the water from the grave of the four beauties of God, with the power
of this water, I'm saying, that I put upon your eyes --. [He raises
can.]

MARTIN DOUL -- [with a sudden movement strikes the can from the Saint's
hand and sends it rocketing across stage. He stands up; People murmur
loudly.] -- If I'm a poor dark sinner I've sharp ears, God help me, and
have left you with a big head on you and it's well I heard the little
splash of the water you had there in the can. Go on now, holy father,
for if you're a fine Saint itself, it's more sense is in a blind man,
and more power maybe than you're thinking at all. Let you walk on now
with your worn feet, and your welted knees, and your fasting, holy ways
a thin pitiful arm. (The Saint looks at him for a moment severely, then
turns away and picks up his can. He pulls Mary Doul up.) For if it's a
right some of you have to be working and sweating the like of Timmy
the smith, and a right some of you have to be fasting and praying and
talking holy talk the like of yourself, I'm thinking it's a good right
ourselves have to be sitting blind, hearing a soft wind turning
round the little leaves of the spring and feeling the sun, and we not
tormenting our souls with the sight of the gray days, and the holy men,
and the dirty feet is trampling the world.

[He gropes towards his stone with Mary Doul.]

MAT SIMON. It'd be an unlucky fearful thing, I'm thinking, to have
the like of that man living near us at all in the townland of Grianan.
Wouldn't he bring down a curse upon us, holy father, from the heavens of
God?

SAINT -- [tying his girdle.] -- God has great mercy, but great wrath for
them that sin.

THE PEOPLE. Go on now, Martin Doul. Go on from this place. Let you not
be bringing great storms or droughts on us maybe from the power of the
Lord. [Some of them throw things at him.]

MARTIN DOUL -- [turning round defiantly and picking up a stone.] -- Keep
off now, the yelping lot of you, or it's more than one maybe will get a
bloody head on him with the pitch of my stone. Keep off now, and let
you not be afeard; for we're going on the two of us to the towns of the
south, where the people will have kind voices maybe, and we won't know
their bad looks or their villainy at all. (He takes Mary Doul's hand
again.) Come along now and we'll be walking to the south, for we've seen
too much of everyone in this place, and it's small joy we'd have living
near them, or hearing the lies they do be telling from the gray of dawn
till the night.

MARY DOUL -- [despondingly.] -- That's the truth, surely; and we'd have
a right to be gone, if it's a long way itself, as I've heard them say,
where you do have to be walking with a slough of wet on the one side and
a slough of wet on the other, and you going a stony path with a north
wind blowing behind. [They go out.]

TIMMY. There's a power of deep rivers with floods in them where you
do have to be lepping the stones and you going to the south, so I'm
thinking the two of them will be drowned together in a short while,
surely.

SAINT. They have chosen their lot, and the Lord have mercy on their
souls. (He rings his bell.) And let the two of you come up now into the
church, Molly Byrne and Timmy the smith, till I make your marriage and
put my blessing on you all.

[He turns to the church; procession forms, and the curtain comes down,
as they go slowly into the church.]
