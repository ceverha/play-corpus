PROLOGUE

_The customary three knocks are heard. The drop-curtain wavers and is
rising, when a voice rings out, "Not yet!" and the_ MANAGER, _a
gentleman of important mien in evening dress, springing from his
proscenium box, hurries toward the stage, repeating, "Not yet!"_

_The curtain is again lowered. The_ MANAGER _turns toward the audience,
and resting one hand on the prompter's box, addresses them:_

The curtain is a wall,--a flying wall. Assured that presently the wall
will fly--why haste? Is it not charming to delay--and just look at it
for a while?

Charming to sit before a great red wall, hanging beneath two gilt masks
and a scroll--The thrilling moment is when the curtain thrills, and
sounds come from the other side.

You are desired to-night to listen to those sounds and entering the
scene before you see it, to wonder and surmise--

_Bending his ear, the_ MANAGER _listens to the sounds now beginning to
come from behind the curtain._

A footstep--is it a road? A flutter of wings--is it a garden?

_The curtain here rippling as if about to rise, the_ MANAGER
_precipitately shouts, "Stop!--Do not raise it yet!" Then again bending
his ear, continues making note of the noises, clear or confused, single
or combined, that from this onward come without stop from behind
the curtain._

A magpie cawing flies away. Great wooden shoes come running over flags.
A courtyard, is it?--If so above a valley--from whence that softened
clamour of birds and barking dogs.

More and more clearly the scene suggests itself--Magically sound
creates an atmosphere!--A sheep bell tinkles intermittently--Since there
is grazing, we may look for grass.

A tree, too--a tree must rustle in the breeze, for a bullfinch warbles
his little native song; and a blackbird whistling the song he has caught
by ear, implies, we may presume, a wicker cage.

The rattling of a wagon run out of a shed--the dripping of a bucket
drawn up overfull--the patter of doves' feet alighting on a roof--Surely
it is a farmyard--unless it be a mill!

Rustling of straw, click of a wooden latch--A stable or a haymow there
must be. The locust shrills: the weather then is fine.--Church-bells
ring: it is Sunday then.--Chatter of jays: the woods cannot be far!

Hark! Nature with the scattered voices of a fair midsummer day is
composing--in a dream!--the most mysterious of overtures--harmonised by
evening distance and the wind!

And all these sounds--song of a passing girl--laughter of children
jogged by the donkey trotting--faraway gun-reports and hunting-horns
--these sounds describe a holiday.

A window opens, a door closes--The harness shakes its bells. Is it not
plain in sight, the old farmyard?--The dog sleeps, the cat but
feigns to sleep.

Sunday!--Farmer and farmer's wife are starting for the fair. The old
horse paws the ground--

A ROUGH VOICE
[_Behind the curtain, through the horse's pawing._] Whoa, Dapple!

ANOTHER VOICE
[_As if calling to a laggard._] Come along! We shan't get home till
morning!

AN IMPATIENT VOICE
Are you ready?

ANOTHER VOICE
Fasten the shutters!

MAN'S VOICE
All right!

WOMAN'S VOICE
My sunshade!

MAN'S VOICE
[_Through the cracking of the whip._] Gee up!

THE MANAGER
The wagon to the jingling of the harness rattles off, jolting out
ditties. A turn in the road cuts off the unfinished song.--They are
gone, quite gone. The performance can begin.

Some philosophers would say there was not a soul left, but we humbly
believe that there are hearts. Man in leaving does not take with him all
drama. One can laugh and suffer without him. [_He listens again._]

Ardently humming, a velvety bumblebee hovers--then is still; he has
plunged into a flower--Let us begin. Pray note that Aesop's hump
to-night does duty as prompter's box!

The members of our company are small, but--[_Calling toward the flies._]
Alexander! [_To the audience._] He is my chief machinist. [_Calling
again._] Let it down!

A VOICE
[_From the flies._] It's coming, sir!

MANAGER
We have lowered between the audience and the stage an invisible screen
of magnifying glass--

But there the violins are tuning up: Scraping of crystal bows, picking
of strings!--Hush! Let the footlights now leap into brightness, for at a
signal from their little leader the crickets' orchestra have briskly
fallen to!

Frrrt! The bumblebee emerges from the flower, shaking the yellow dust--A
Hen comes on the scene as in La Fontaine's fable. A Cuckoo calls, as in
Beethoven's symphony.

Hush! Let the chandelier draw in its myriad lights--for the curious
call-boy of the woods has, airily, to summon us, repeated thrice his
double call--

And since Nature is one of our performers, and feathered notables are on
our staff--Hush! the curtain must go up: A wood-pecker's bill has rapped
out the three strokes!




ACT I


THE EVENING OF THE PHEASANT-HEN

_A farmyard such as the sounds from behind the curtain have described.
At the right, a house over-clambered with wistaria. At the left, the
farmyard gate, letting on to the road. A dog-kennel. At the back, a low
wall, beyond which distant country landscape. The details of the setting
define themselves in the course of the act._



SCENE FIRST

_The whole barnyard company,_ HENS, CHICKENS, CHICKS, DUCKS, TURKEYS,
_etc.;_ THE BLACKBIRD _in his cage_, THE CAT _asleep on the wall, later_
A BUTTERFLY _on the flowers._


THE WHITE HEN
[_Pecking._] Ah! Delicious!

ANOTHER HEN
What are you eating?

ALL THE HENS
[_Rushing to the spot._] What's she eating?

THE WHITE HEN
A small green beetle, crisp and nice, tasting of the rose-leaves he had
lived on.

THE BLACK HEN
[_Standing before the_ BLACKBIRD'S _cage._] Really, the Blackbird
whistles amazingly!

THE WHITE HEN
Any little street urchin can do as much!

THE TURKEY
[_Solemnly._] An urchin who had learned of a shepherd in Sicily!

THE DUCK
He never whistles his tune to the end--

THE TURKEY
That's too easy, carrying it to the end! [_He hums the tune the_
BLACKBIRD _has been whistling._] "How sweet to fare afield, and
cull--and cull--" You should know, Duck, that the thing in art is to
leave off before the end! "And cull--and cull--" Bravo, Blackbird!

[_The_ BLACKBIRD _comes out on the little platform in front of his cage
and bows._]

A CHICK
[_Astonished._] Can he get out?

BLACKBIRD
Applause is salt on my tail!

THE CHICK
But his cage?

THE TURKEY
He can come out, and he can go in again. His cage has that sort of
spring.--"And cull--and cull--" The whole point is missed if you tell
them what you cull!

THE BLACK HEN
[_Catching sight of a_ BUTTERFLY _alighting on the flowers above the
wall at the back._] Oh, what a gorgeous butterfly!

THE WHITE HEN
Where?

THE BLACK HEN
On the honey-suckle.

THE TURKEY
That kind is called an Admiral.

THE CHICK
[_Looking after the_ BUTTERFLY.] Now he has settled on a pink.

THE WHITE HEN
[_To the_ TURKEY.] An Admiral, wherefore?

THE BLACKBIRD
Obviously because he is neither a seaman nor a soldier.

THE WHITE HEN
Our Blackbird has a pretty wit!

THE TURKEY
[_Nodding and swinging his red stalactite._] He has better than wit, my
dear!

ANOTHER HEN
[_Watching the_ BUTTERFLY.] It's sweet--a butterfly!

THE BLACKBIRD
Easy as possible to make! You take a W and set it on top of a Y!

A HEN
[_Delighted._] A flourish of his bill, and there you have your
caricature!

THE TURKEY
He does better than execute caricatures! Hen, our Blackbird forces you
to think while obliging you to laugh. He is a Teacher in wit's clothing.

A CHICK
[_To a_ HEN.] Mother, why does the Cat hate the Dog?

THE BLACKBIRD
Because he appropriates his seat at the theatre.

THE CHICK
[_Surprised._] They have a theatre?

THE BLACKBIRD
Where dumb-shows are given.

THE CHICK
Eh?

THE BLACKBIRD
The hearthstone from whence both alike wish to watch the play of the
Fire among the Logs.

THE TURKEY
[_Delighted._] How aptly he conveys that the hatred of peoples is at
bottom a question of wanting the other's territory. There's a brain
for you!

THE SPECKLED HEN
[_To the_ WHITE HEN, _who is pecking._] Do you peck peppers?

THE WHITE HEN
Constantly.

THE SPECKLED HEN
How can you stand the sting?

THE WHITE HEN
It imparts to the feathers a delicate rosy tint.

THE SPECKLED HEN
Oh, does it!

A VOICE IN THE DISTANCE
Cuckoo!

THE WHITE HEN
Listen!

THE VOICE
[_From a greater distance._] Cuckoo!

THE WHITE HEN
The Cuckoo!

A GREY HEN
[_Comes running excitedly._] Which Cuckoo? The one who lives in the
woods, or the one who lives in the clock?

THE VOICE
[_Still further off._] Cuckoo!

THE WHITE HEN
The one of the woods.

THE GREY HEN
[_With a sigh of relief._] Oh, I was so afraid of having missed the
other!

THE WHITE HEN
[_Going near enough to her to speak in an undertone._] Do you mean to
say you love him?

THE GREY HEN
[_Sadly._] Without ever having set eyes on him. He lives in a chalet
hanging on the kitchen wall, above the farmer's great-coat and
fowling-piece. The moment he sings, I rush to the spot, but I never get
there in time to see anything but his little wicket closing. This
evening I mean to stay right here beside the door--[_She takes up her
position on the threshold._]

A VOICE
White Hen!



SCENE SECOND

THE SAME, _a_ PIGEON _on the roof, later_ CHANTECLER.


THE WHITE HEN
[_Looking about with quick jerks of her head._] Who called me?

THE VOICE
A pigeon.

THE WHITE HEN
[_Looking for him._] Where?

THE PIGEON
On the sloping roof.

THE WHITE HEN
[_Lifting her head and seeing him._] Ah!

THE PIGEON
Though I am the bearer of an important missive, I would not miss the
opportunity--Good evening, Hen!

THE WHITE HEN
Postman, howdedo?

THE PIGEON
My duty on the Postal Service of the Air obliging me this summer evening
to pass your habitations, I should be most happy if--

THE WHITE HEN
[_Spying a crumb of some sort._] One moment, please.

ANOTHER HEN
[_Running eagerly towards her._] What are you eating?

ALL THE HENS
[_Arriving at a run._] What's she eating?

THE WHITE HEN
A simple grain of wheat.

THE GREY HEN
[_Taking up her conversation with the_ WHITE HEN.] As I was telling you,
I mean to stay right on the door-step there--[_Showing the door of
the house._]

THE WHITE HEN
[_Looking at the door._] The door is shut.

THE GREY HEN
Yes, but I shall hear the hour striking, and I will catch a look at my
Cuckoo by stretching my neck,--

THE PIGEON
[_Calling, slightly out of patience._] White Hen!

THE WHITE HEN
One moment, please! [_To the_ GREY HEN.]--Catch a look at your Cuckoo,
by stretching your neck where?--Where?

THE GREY HEN
[_Pointing with her beak at the small, round opening at the foot of the
door._] Through the cat-hole!

THE PIGEON
[_Raising his voice to a shout._] Am I to be kept here cooling my feet
on your rain-pipe? Hi, there, whitest of Hens!

THE WHITE HEN
[_Hopping towards him._] You were saying?

THE PIGEON
I was about to say--

THE WHITE HEN
What, bluest of Pigeons?

THE PIGEON
That I should consider myself past expression fortunate if--But no! I am
abashed at my own boldness!--if I might be so favoured as to be
permitted to get a glimpse--

THE WHITE HEN
Of what?

THE PIGEON
Oh, just a glimpse, the very least glimpse of--

ALL THE HENS
[_Impatiently._] Of what?--What?

THE PIGEON
Of his comb!

THE WHITE HEN
[_Laughing, to the others._] Ha! ha! he wishes to see--

THE PIGEON
[_In great excitement._] That's it! Just to see--

THE WHITE HEN
There, there, cool down!

THE PIGEON
I am shaking with excitement!

THE WHITE HEN
You are shaking down the roof!

THE PIGEON
You can't think how we admire him!

THE WHITE HEN
Oh, everyone admires him!

THE PIGEON
And I promised my missis to tell her what he is like!

THE WHITE HEN
[_Quietly pecking._] Oh, he's a fine fellow, no doubt
of that!

THE PIGEON
We can hear him crowing from our dove-cote. The One he is whose song is
more an ornament to the landscape than the white hamlet to the hill! The
One he is whose cry pierces the blue horizon like a gold-threaded needle
stitching the hill-tops to the sky! The Cock he is! When you would
praise him, call him the Cock!

THE BLACKBIRD
[_Hopping up and down in his cage._] Tick-tock!--who sets all hearts
a-beating, tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock!

A HEN
Our Cock!

THE BLACKBIRD
[_Thrusting his head between the bars of his cage._] My, thy, his, her,
our, your, and their Cock!

THE TURKEY
[_To the_ PIGEON.] He will soon be coming in from his usual round in the
fields.

THE PIGEON
You have the honour of his acquaintance, sir?

THE TURKEY
[_Importantly._] I have known him from a baby. This chick--for to me he
is still a chick!--used to come to me for his bugle lesson.

THE PIGEON
Ah, indeed? You give lessons in--

THE TURKEY
Certainly. A bird who can gobble is qualified to teach crowing.

THE PIGEON
Where was he born?

THE TURKEY
[_Indicating an old covered basket, badly battered and broken._] In that
old basket.

THE PIGEON
And is the hen who brooded him still living?

THE TURKEY
[_Again indicating the basket._] She is there.

THE PIGEON
Where?

THE TURKEY
In that old basket.

THE PIGEON
[_More and more interested._] Of what breed is she?

THE TURKEY
She is just a good old-fashioned Gascon hen, born in the neighbourhood
of Pau.

THE BLACKBIRD
[_Thrusting out his head._] She is the one Henry the Fourth wished to
see cooking in every Frenchman's pot!

THE PIGEON
How proud she must be of having hatched such a Cock!

THE TURKEY
Yes, proud with a lowly foster-mother's pride. Her beloved chick is
coming to his inches, that is all she seems to understand or care about.
And when you tell her this, her clouded reason gives a momentary gleam--
[_Calling towards the basket._] Hey, old lady, he is growing!

ALL THE HENS
He is growing!

[_The lid of the basket is suddenly lifted, and a bristling aged hen's
head appears._]

THE PIGEON
[_To the_ OLD HEN, _gently and feelingly._] Does it make you happy,
mother, to think of him grown to a big fine Cock?

THE OLD HEN
[_Nodding, sententiously._] Happy?--Wednesday's crops do credit to
Tuesday! [_She disappears, the lid drops._]

THE TURKEY
She opens now and then, like that, and ping! shoots at us some such
pearl of homely lore--

THE PIGEON
[_To the_ WHITE HEN.] White Hen!

THE TURKEY
--not always wholly without point!

THE OLD HEN
[_Reappearing for an instant._] In the Peacock's absence, the Turkey
spreads his tail!

[_The_ TURKEY _turns quickly around, the lid has already dropped._]

THE PIGEON
[_To the_ WHITE HEN.] Is it a fact that Chantecler is never hoarse,
never the very least husky?

THE WHITE HEN
[_Keeping on with her pecking._] Perfectly true.

THE PIGEON
[_With growing enthusiasm._] Ah, you must be proud Cock who will be
numbered among Illustrious Animals and his name remembered five, ten,
fifteen years!

THE TURKEY
Very proud. Very proud. [_To a_ CHICK.] Who are the Illustrious Animals?
Tell them off!

THE CHICK
[_Reciting a lesson._] Noah's Dove--Saint Rocco's Poodle--The--the Horse
of Cali--

THE TURKEY
Cali--?

THE CHICK
[_Trying to remember._] Cali--

THE PIGEON
This Cock, now--this Cock of yours--Is it true that his song attunes,
inspires, encourages, makes labour light, and keeps off birds of prey?

THE WHITE HEN
[_Pecking._] Perfectly true.

THE CHICK
[_Still hunting for his word._] Cali--Cali--

THE PIGEON
White Hen, is it true that by his song, defender of the warm and sacred
egg, he has frequently kept the lissome weasel from--

THE BLACKBIRD
[_Looking out between the bars._]--messing his shirtfront with omelette?

THE WHITE HEN
Perfectly true.

THE CHICK
Cali--

THE TURKEY
[_Helping him._] Gu?

THE CHICK
Gu--

THE PIGEON
Is it true--?

THE CHICK
[_Jumping for joy at having found._] Gula!

THE PIGEON
--true that, as report says, he has a secret for his amazing singing, a
secret whereby his crow becomes the brilliant burst of red which makes
the poppies of the field feel themselves contemptible imitations?

THE WHITE HEN
[_Weary of this questioning._] Perfectly true.

THE PIGEON
That secret, that great secret, is it known to anyone?

THE WHITE HEN
No.

THE PIGEON
He has not even told his Hen?

THE WHITE HEN
[_Correcting him._] His Hens.

THE PIGEON
[_Slightly shocked._] Ah, he has more than one?

THE BLACKBIRD
He crows, remember, you only coo.

THE PIGEON
Well, then, he has not even told his favourite?

THE TUFTED HEN
[_Promptly._] No, he has not!

THE WHITE HEN
[_As promptly._] No, he has not!

THE BLACK HEN
[_As promptly._] No, he has not!

THE BLACKBIRD
[_Thrusting out his head._] Hush!--An aërial drama! The Butterfly,
absorbed in his head of blossom, banquets, all oblivious of--

[_A great green gauze butterfly-net appears above the wall, softly
coming towards the_ BUTTERFLY _settled on one of the flowers._]

A HEN
What is that?

THE TURKEY
[_Solemnly._] Fate!

THE BLACKBIRD
In a thin disguise of gauze!

THE WHITE HEN
Oh, a net--at the end of a cane!

THE BLACKBIRD
No harm in the cane--it's the kid at the other end of the cane! [_Half
aloud, watching the_ BUTTERFLY.] You neat little fop, sailing from rose
to rose, to-night you'll be neat as a pin can make you!

ALL
[_Watching the cautious approach of the net beyond the wall._]
Nearer--Nearer--Hush! He'll catch it!--No he won't!--Yes, he will!

SUDDENLY OUTSIDE
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

[_At the sound, the_ BUTTERFLY _flies off. The_ NET _wavers a moment,
with an effect of disappointment, then disappears._]

SEVERAL HENS
What?--Eh?--What was it?

A HEN
[_Who having hopped up on a wheelbarrow can follow the flight of the_
BUTTERFLY.] He is off and away, over the meadow.

THE BLACKBIRD
[_With ironical emphasis._] It's Chantecler, practicing knight-errantry!

THE PIGEON
[_With emotion._] Chantecler!

A HEN
He is coming!

ANOTHER HEN
He is just outside--

THE WHITE HEN
[_To the_ PIGEON.] Now you will see. He's a very fine bird indeed.

THE BLACKBIRD
[_Thrusting his head between the bars._] Easy as possible to make, a
Cock!

THE TURKEY
[_Admiringly._] Admirable amenity!

THE BLACKBIRD
You take a melon--a fine specimen, I will grant,--for the trunk. For the
legs, two sticks of asparagus,--prize sticks, of course. For the head, a
red pepper,--as handsome as you may find. For the eye, a
currant,--exceptionally clear and light. For the tail, a sheaf of leeks,
with luxuriant blue-green flags. For the ear, a dainty kidney-bean,
--extra, superfine!--And there you have him, there's your Cock!

THE PIGEON
[_Gently._] One thing you have omitted--His heavenly clarion call!

THE BLACKBIRD
[_Indicating_ CHANTECLER, _who now appears upon the wall._] Yes, but
with the exception of that--slight detail, you must own my portrait is
a likeness.

THE PIGEON
Not at all. Not in the very least. [_Contemplating_ CHANTECLER _with a
very different eye from the_ BLACKBIRD'S.] What I see, beneath that
quivering hemlet, is Summer's glorious and favoured knight, who, from a
groaning wain at evening borrowing its golden harvest-robe has arrayed
himself in this, and lifts it from the dust with a gleaming sickle!

CHANTECLER
[_On the wall, in a long guttural sigh._] Coa--

THE BLACKBIRD
When he makes that noise in his throat, he either is in love, or
preparing some poetic outburst.

CHANTECLER
[_Motionless on the wall, with head high._] Blaze forth in
glory!--Dazzle--

THE BLACKBIRD
He's letting off hot air!

CHANTECLER
Irradiate the world!

A HEN
Now he pauses--one claw lifted--

CHANTECLER
[_In a sort of groan of excessive tenderness._] Coa--

THE BLACKBIRD
That, if you please, is ecstasy!

CHANTECLER
Thy gold is of all gold alone beneficent! I worship thee!

THE PIGEON
[_Under breath._] To whom is he talking?

THE BLACKBIRD
[_Sneering._] To the sun, sonny, the sun!

CHANTECLER
  O thou that driest the tears of the meanest among weeds
  And dost of a dead flower make a living butterfly--
  Thy miracle, wherever almond-trees
  Shower down the wind their scented shreds,
  Dead petals dancing in a living swarm--
  I worship thee, O Sun! whose ample light,
  Blessing every forehead, ripening every fruit,
  Entering every flower and every hovel,
  Pours itself forth and yet is never less,
  Still spending and unspent--like mother's love!

  I sing of thee, and will be thy high priest,
  Who disdainest not to glass thy shining face
  In the humble basin of blue suds,
  Or see the lightning of thy last farewell
  Reflected in an humble cottage pane!

THE BLACKBIRD
[_Thrusting out his head._] Can't call it off now, boys, he's started on
an ode!

THE TURKEY
[_Watching_ CHANTECLER _as by a series of stately hops he comes down a
pile of hay._] Here he comes, prouder than--

A HEN
[_Stopping in front of a small tin cone._] See there! The new-fangled
drinking-trough! [_She drinks._] Handy!

THE BLACKBIRD
Prouder than a drum major chanting as he marches:
  "My country, 'tis of thee!"

CHANTECLER
[_Beginning to walk about the yard._]
  Thou smilest on the--

ALL THE HENS
[_Rushing to the_ WHITE HEN _who is eating something._] What's she
eating?

THE WHITE HEN
Corn. Nothing but corn.

CHANTECLER
  Thou smilest on the sunflower craning after thee,
  And burnishest my brother of the vane,
  And softly sifting through the linden-trees
  Strewest the ground with dappled gold,
  So fine there's no more walking where it lies.

  Through thee the earthen pot is an enamelled urn,
  The clout hung out to dry a noble banner,
  The hay-rick by thy favour boasts a golden cape,
  And the rick's little sister, the thatched hive,
  Wears, by thy grace, a hood of gold!

  Glory to thee in the vineyards! Glory to thee in the fields!
  Glory among the grass and on the roofs,
  In eyes of lizards and on wings of swans,--
  Artist who making splendid the great things
  Forgets not to make exquisite the small!

  'Tis thou that, cutting out a silhouette,
  To all thou beamest on dost fasten this dark twin,
  Doubling the number of delightful shapes,
  Appointing to each thing its shadow,
  More charming often than itself.

  I praise thee, Sun! Thou sheddest roses on the air,
  Diamonds on the stream, enchantment on the hill;
  A poor dull tree thou takest and turnest to green rapture,
  O Sun, without whose golden magic--things
  Would be no more than what they are!

THE PIGEON
Bravo! I shall have something to tell my mate. We shall long talk of
this!

CHANTECLER
[_Seeing him, with noble courtesy._] Young blue-winged stranger, with
new-fledged bill, thanks! Pray lay my duty at her coral feet!

[_The_ PIGEON _flies off._]

THE BLACKBIRD
Jolly your admirers, it pays!

CHANTECLER
[_In a cordial voice, to the whole barnyard._] To work now, all of you,
with a will!

[_A_ FLY _darts past, buzzing._]

CHANTECLER
Busy and resonant Fly, I love thee! Behold her! What is her flight but
the heart-whole gift of herself?

THE TURKEY
[_Loftily._] Yes.--She has dropped considerably in my esteem, however,
since that matter of the--

CHANTECLER
Of the what?

THE TURKEY
Of the Fly and the--

CHANTECLER
I never thought much of that story. Who knows whether the coach would
have reached the top of the hill without the Fly? Do you believe that
rude shouts "Gee up! Ge' lang!" were more effective than the hymn to the
Sun buzzed by the little Fly? Do you believe in the virtue of a
blustering oath? Really believe it was the Coachman who made the coach
to go? No, I tell you, no! She did much more than the big whip's noisy
cracking, did the little Fly, with the music straight from her
buzzing heart!

THE TURKEY
Yes, but all the same--

CHANTECLER
[_Turning his back on him._] Come, let us make of labour a delight!
Come, all of you!--High time, Ganders my worthies, you escorted your
geese to the pond.

A GANDER
[_Lazily._] Is it quite necessary, do you think?

CHANTECLER
[_Going briskly towards him, with a look that forbids discussion._]
Quite! And let there be no idle quacking and paltering! [_The_ GANDERS
_go off in haste._] You, Chicken, your task, as you know, is to pick off
slugs, your full number before evening being thirty-two.--You,
Cockerel, go practise your crow. Four hundred times cry
Cock-a-doodle-doo in hearing of the echo!

THE COCKEREL
[_Slightly mortified._] The echo--?

CHANTECLER
That is what I was doing to limber up my glottis before I was rid of the
egg-shell sticking to my tail!

A HEN
[_Airily._] None of this is particularly interesting!

CHANTECLER
Everything is interesting! Pray go and sit on the eggs you have been
entrusted with! [_To another_ HEN.] You, walk among the roses and
verbenas, and gobble every creature threatening them. Ha, ha! If the
caterpillar thinks we will make him a gift of our flowers he can stroke
his belly--with his back! [_To another._] You, hie to the rescue of
cabbages in old neglected corners, where the grasshopper lays siege to
them with his vigorous battering-ram! [_To the remaining_ HENS.]
You--[_Catching sight of the_ OLD HEN, _whose shaking, senile head has
lifted the basket-lid._] Ah, there you are, Nursie! Good day! [_She
gazes at him admiringly._] Well, have I grown?

THE OLD HEN
Sooner or later, tadpole becomes toad!

CHANTECLER
True! [_To the _HENS,_ resuming his tone of command._] Ladies, stand in
line! Your orders are to peck in the fields. Off at a quick-step, go!

THE WHITE HEN
[_To the_ GREY HEN.] Are you coming?

THE GREY HEN
Not a word! I intend to stay behind, to see the Cuckoo. [_She hides
behind the basket._]

CHANTECLER
You, little tufted hen, was it just my fancy that you looked sulky
falling into line?

THE TUFTED HEN
[_Going up to him._] Cock--

CHANTECLER
What is it?

THE TUFTED HEN
I, who am nearest to your heart--

CHANTECLER
[_Quickly._] Hush!

THE TUFTED HEN
It annoys me not to be told--

THE WHITE HEN
[_Who has drawn near on the other side._] Cock--

CHANTECLER
Well?

THE WHITE HEN
[_Coaxingly._] I who am your favourite--

CHANTECLER
[_Quickly._] Hush!

THE WHITE HEN
[_Caressingly._] I want to know--

THE BLACK HEN
[_Who has softly drawn near._] Cock--

CHANTECLER
What?

THE BLACK HEN
Your special and tender regard for me--

CHANTECLER
[_Quickly._] Hush!

THE BLACK HEN
Tell me, do--

THE WHITE HEN
--the secret--

THE TUFTED HEN
--of your song? [_Going still closer to him, in a voice thrilled with
curiosity._] I do believe that you have in your throat a little copper
contrivance--

CHANTECLER
That's it, that's what I have, very carefully concealed!

THE WHITE HEN
[_Same business._] Most likely, like great tenors one has heard of, you
gulp raw eggs--

CHANTECLER
You have guessed!--A second Ugolino!

THE BLACK HEN
[_Same business._] My idea is that taking snails out of their shells,
you pound them to a paste--

CHANTECLER
And make them into troches! Exactly!

ALL THREE HENS
Cock--!

CHANTECLER
Off with you all! Be off! [_The_ HENS _hastily start, he calls them
back._] A word before you go. When your blood-bright combs--now in, now
out of sight, now in again--shall flash among the sage and borage
yonder, like poppies playing at hide-and-seek,--to the real poppies, I
enjoin you, do no injury! Shepherdesses, counting the stitches of their
knitting, trample the grass all unaware that it's a crime to crush a
flower--even with a woman! But you, my Spouses, show considerate and
touching thought for the flowers whose only offence is growing wild. The
field-carrot has her right to bloom in beauty. Should you spy, as he
strolls across some flowery umbel, a scarlet beetle peppered with black
dots,--the stroller take, but spare his strolling-ground. The flowers of
one same meadow are sisters, as I hold, and should together fall beneath
the scythe!--Now you may go. [_They are leaving, he again calls them
back._] And remember, when chickens go to the--

A HEN
--fields--

CHANTECLER
--the foremost--

THE HENS ALL TOGETHER
--walks ahead!

CHANTECLER
You may go! [_They are again starting, he peremptorily calls them
back._] A word! [_In a stern voice._] Never when crossing the road stop
to peck! [_The_ HENS _bow in obedience._] Now let me see you cross!

A HORN
[_In the distance._] Honk! Honk! Honk!

CHANTECLER
[_Rushing in front of the_ HENS _and spreading his wings before them._]
Not yet!

THE HORN
[_Very near, accompanied by a terrific snorting._] Honk! Honk! Honk!

CHANTECLER
[_Barring the_ HENS' _passage, while everything shakes._] Wait!

THE HORN
[_Far away._] Honk! Honk! Honk!

CHANTECLER
[_Standing aside for them to pass._] You can safely go!

THE GREY HEN
[_From her hiding-place._] He has not seen me!

THE TUFTED HEN
You may think this is fun! Now everything we eat will taste of gasoline!



SCENE THIRD

CHANTECLER, _the_ BLACKBIRD _in his cage, the_ CAT _still asleep on the
wall, the_ GREY HEN _behind the_ OLD HEN'S _basket._


CHANTECLER
[_To himself, after a pause._] No, I will not trust a frivolous soul
with such a weighty secret. Let me try rather to cast off the burden of
it myself--forget and [_Shaking his feathers._] just rejoice in being a
rooster! [_He struts up and down._] I am beautiful. I am proud. I
walk--then I stand still. I give a skip or two, I tread a measure.--I
shock the cart sometimes by my boldness with the fair, so that it raises
scandalised shafts in horror to the sky!--Hang care!--A barleycorn--Eat
and be merry.--The gear upon my head and under my eye is a far more
gorgeous red, when I puff out my chest and strut, than any robin's
waistcoat or finch's tie.--A fine day. All is well. I curvet--I blow my
horn. Conscious of having done my duty, I may quite properly assume the
swagger of a musketeer, and the calm commanding bearing of a cardinal.
I can--

A VOICE
[_Loud and gruff._] Beware, Chantecler!

CHANTECLER
What silly beast is bidding me beware?



SCENE FOURTH

THE SAME, PATOU.


PATOU
[_Barking inside his kennel._] I! I! I!

CHANTECLER
[_Retreating._] Is it you, Patou, good shaggy head starting out of the
dark, with straws caught among your eyelashes?

PATOU
Which do not prevent my seeing what is plain as that hen-house rrrroof!

CHANTECLER
Cross?

PATOU
Grrrrrrr--

CHANTECLER
When he rolls his r's like that he is very cross indeed.

PATOU
It's my devotion to you, Cock, makes me roll my r's. Guardian of the
house, the orchard and the fields, more than all else I am bound to
protect your song. And I growl at the dangers I suspect lurking. Such is
my humour.

CHANTECLER
Your humour? Your dogma, suspicion is! Call it your _dog_ma!

PATOU
You can stoop to a pun? From bad to worse! I'm enough of a psychologist
to feel the evil spreading, and I've the scent of a rat-terrier.

CHANTECLER
But you are no rat-terrier!

PATOU
[_Shaking his head._] Chantecler, how do we know?

CHANTECLER
[_Considering him._] Your appearance is in fact peculiar What actually
is your breed?

PATOU
I am a horrible mixture, issue of every passer-by! I can feel barking
within me the voice of every blood. Retriever, mastiff, pointer, poodle,
hound--my soul is a whole pack, sitting in circle, musing. Cock, I am
all dogs, I have been every dog!

CHANTECLER
Then what a sum of goodness must be stored in you!

PATOU
Brother, we are framed to understand each other. You sing to the sun and
scratch up the earth. I, when I wish to do myself a good and a
pleasure--

CHANTECLER
You lie on the earth and sleep in the sun!

PATOU
[_With a pleased yap._] Aye!

CHANTECLER
We have ever had in common our love for those two things.

PATOU
I am so fond of the sun that I howl at the moon. And so fond of the
earth that I dig great holes and shove my nose in it!

CHANTECLER
I know! The gardener's wife has her opinion of those holes.--But what
are the dangers you discern? All lies quiet beneath the quiet sky.
Nothing appears to be threatening my humble sunlit dominions.

THE OLD HEN
[_Lifting the basket-lid with her head._] The egg looks like marble
until it gets smashed! [_The lid drops._]

CHANTECLER
[_To_ PATOU.] What dangers, friend?

PATOU
There are two. First, in yonder cage--

CHANTECLER
Well?

PATOU
That satirical whistling.

CHANTECLER
What about it?

PATOU
Pernicious.

CHANTECLER
In what way?

PATOU
In every way!

CHANTECLER
[_Ironical._] Bad as all that, is it? [_The_ PEACOCK'S _squall is heard
in the distance: "Ee--yong!"_]

PATOU
And then that cry, the Peacock's!

[_The_ PEACOCK, _further off: "Ee--yong!"_]

PATOU
More out of tune all by itself than a whole village singing society!

CHANTECLER
Come, what have they done to you, that whistler and that posturer?

PATOU
[_Grumbling._] They have done to me--that I know not what they may do to
you! They have done to me--that among us simple, kindly folk they have
introduced new fashions, the Blackbird of being funny, the Peacock of
putting on airs! Fashions which the latter in his grotesque bad taste
picked up parading on the marble terraces of the vulgar rich, and the
former--Heaven knows where! along with his cynicism and his slang. Now
the one, travelling salesman of blighting corrosive laughter, and the
other, brainless ambassador of Fashion, their mission to kill among us
love and labour, the first by persiflage, the second by display,--they
have brought to us, even here in our peaceful sunny corner, the two
pests, the saddest in the world, the jest which insists on being funny
at any cost, and the cry which insists on being the latest scream! [_The
_ BLACKBIRD _is heard tentatively whistling, "How sweet to fare
afield"._] You, Cock, who had the sense to prefer the grain of true
wheat to the pearl, how can you allow yourself to be taken in by that
villainous Blackbird! A bird who practises a tune!

CHANTECLER
[_Indulgently._] Come, he whistles his tune like many another!

PATOU
[_Unwillingly agreeing, in a drawling growl._] Ye-e-es, but he never
whistles it to the end!

CHANTECLER
[_Watching the_ BLACKBIRD _hopping about._] A light-hearted fellow!

PATOU
[_Same business._] Ye-e-es, but he lies heavy on our hearts. A bird who
takes his exercise indoors!

CHANTECLER
You must own he is intelligent!

PATOU
[_In a longer, more hesitant growl._] Ye-e-e-es! But not so very! For
his eye never brightens with wonder and admiration. He preserves before
the flower--of whose stalk he sees more than of its chalice--the glance
which deflowers, the tone which depreciates!

CHANTECLER
Taste, my dear fellow, he unmistakably has!

PATOU
Ye-e-e-es! But not much taste! To wear black is too easy a way of having
taste! One should have the courage of colours on his wing.

CHANTECLER
You will admit at least that he has an original fancy. No denying that
he is amusing.

PATOU
Ye-e-es--No! Why is it amusing to adopt a few stock phrases and make
them do service at every turn? Why amusing to miscall, exaggerate, and
vulgarise?

CHANTECLER
His mind has a diverting, unexpected turn--

PATOU
Ready but cheap! I cannot think it particularly brilliant to remark,
with a knowing wink, at sight of an innocent cow at pasture, "The simple
cow knows her way to the hay!" Nor do I regard it as evidence of notable
mental gifts to answer the greeting of the inoffensive duck, "The quack
shoots off his mouth!" No, the extravagances of that Blackbird, who
makes me bristle, no more constitute wit than his slang achieves style!

CHANTECLER
He is not altogether to blame. He wears the modern garb. See him there
in correct evening dress. He looks, in his neat black coat--

PATOU
Like a beastly little undertaker who, after burying Faith, hops with
relief and glee!

CHANTECLER
There, there! You make him blacker than he is!

PATOU
I do believe a blackbird is just a misfit crow!

CHANTECLER
His diminutive size, however--

PATOU
[_Vigorously shaking his ears._] Oh, be not deceived by his size! Evil
makes his models first on a tiny scale. The soul of a cutlass dwells in
the pocket-knife; blackbird and crow are of the selfsame crape, and the
striped wasp is a tiger in miniature!

CHANTECLER
[_Amused at_ PATOU'S _violence._] The blackbird in short is wicked,
stupid, ugly--

PATOU
The chief thing about the Blackbird is--that you can't tell what he is!
Is there thought in that head? feeling in that breast? Hear him!
"Tew-tew-tew-tew tew--"

CHANTECLER
But what harm does he do?

PATOU
He tew-tew-tews! And nothing is so mortal to thought and sentiment as
that same derisive tew-tewing, disingenuous and non-committal! Day by
day, and that is why I roll my rs, I must witness this debasing of
language and ideals. It's enough to produce rabies!

CHANTECLER
Come, Patou!--

PATOU
In their objectionable jargon, they have the ha-ha on all of us! I am no
fastidious King Charles, but I dislike, I tell you, being referred to as
His Whiskers!--Oh, to be gone, escape, follow the heels of some poor
shepherd without a crust in his wallet, but at least, at evening
drinking from the glassy pond, to have--oh, better than all
marrow-bones!--the fresh illusion of lapping up the stars!

CHANTECLER
[_Surprised at_ PATOU'S _having lowered his voice to utter the last
words._] Why do you drop your voice?

PATOU
You see?--If we speak of stars nowadays we must do it in a whisper! [_He
lays his head on his paws in deep dejection._]

CHANTECLER
[_Comforting him._] Be not downcast!

PATOU
[_Lifting his head again._] No, it is too silly and too weak! I'll shout
it if I please! [_He howls with the whole power of his lungs._]
Stars!--[_Then in a tone of relief._] There, I feel better!

CHICKENS
[_Passing at the back, mocking._] Stars!--Ho! Stars for ours! Stars!
[_They go off, fooling and giggling._]

PATOU
Hear them! Our pullets will be whistling soon like blackbirds!

CHANTECLER
[_Proudly strutting up and down._] What care I? I sing, and have on my
side the Hens.

PATOU
Trust not to the hearts of Hens--or of crowds. You are too willing to
take the price of your singing in lip-service.

CHANTECLER
But love--love is glory awarded in kisses!

PATOU
Ah! I, too, was young once, I had my wilding devil's beauty,--an
inflammatory eye, an inflammable heart. Well, I was deceived. For a
handsomer dog?--No, they deceived me for a miserable cur!--[_Roaring in
sudden wrath._] For whom?--For whom, do you suppose?

CHANTECLER
[_Retreating._] You alarm me!

PATOU
For a low-down dachshund who trod on his own ears!

THE BLACKBIRD
[_Who has overheard_ PATOU'S _last words, sticking his head between the
bars of his cage._] Still harping on the dachshund, is he? What's the
odds, old chappie? You were the goat!--How does being the goat matter?

PATOU
But you up there, scoffing at everything, who are you, may one ask?

BLACKBIRD
I'm the pet of the poultry yard!

PATOU
Bad luck is what you'll bring them!

BLACKBIRD
A prophecy-sharp?--Say, wisteria, we are twisted up with laughter! [_He
comes out of his cage and hops to the ground._]

PATOU
[_As he approaches_] Grrrrrrr--

CHANTECLER
Hush! He's a friend!

PATOU
A false one.

CHANTECLER
[_To_ BLACKBIRD.] Fine things we learn when the talk is of you!

THE OLD HEN
[_Her head protruding from the basket._] Strike rotten wood, and see the
wood-lice scatter! [_The basket-lid drops._]

PATOU
[_To_ CHANTECLER.] He laughs at you behind your back!

BLACKBIRD
[_To_ PATOU.] Ha, retriever, you retrieve?

PATOU
When you pour forth your heart in your ardent cry, giving it over and
over, he calls it the same old saw that your jag-toothed red crest
stands for!

CHANTECLER
So that's what you say?

BLACKBIRD
[_Affecting simplicity._] You surely don't mind? How can it affect you?
And a joke about you is always so sure of success!

PATOU
[_To the_ BLACKBIRD.] Point-blank, do you admire or despise the Cock?

BLACKBIRD
I make fun of him in spots, but admire him in lump!

PATOU
You always peck two kinds of seed.

THE BLACKBIRD
My cage has two seed-cups, you see.

PATOU
I am single-minded and downright!

THE BLACKBIRD
You--are an old poodle of the year 48! I am an up-to-date bird!

PATOU
[_Gruffly._] Out of my way! lest I give your black coat red tails!
[_The_ BLACKBIRD _nimbly gets out of the way,_ PATOU _goes into his
kennel grumbling._] I'll show him some up-to-date jaws!

CHANTECLER
Be quiet! It's his way. The truth is that if once he stood in the
presence of beauty, this very Blackbird would applaud!

PATOU
Not with both wings! What can you expect of a bird who, with woodbine
and juniper full in sight, prefers to go inside and peck at a
musty biscuit?

BLACKBIRD
He never seems to suspect that the poacher is a blackguardly sort of
brute!

PATOU
What I know is that the underbrush is all a delicate golden gloom--

THE BLACKBIRD
Yes, but leaden shot can cleave your delicate gold. The quail is such a
canny bird, that he lies low lest he make his last appearance on toast.
And so, in lack of quail--

PATOU
Does the great stag delight any the less in his green forest for turning
over among the grass at evening some bit of a rusty cartridge?

THE BLACKBIRD
No, old chap--but the stag, you see, is just another kind of a hat-rack!

PATOU
Oh, but freedom, freedom, with violets looking on! Love!--

THE BLACKBIRD
Antediluvian pastimes! not nearly such good fun as my nice new wooden
trapeze. Oh, my cage, let us sign a joyful three-six-nine years' lease!
I live like a Duke, I have filtered drinking-water--[_At_ PATOU'S
_significant start and growl, he springs aside, finishing._] You can
sling mud upon me, I have a porcelain bath!

CHANTECLER
[_Slightly out of patience._] Why not make a practice of talking simply
and to the point?

THE BLACKBIRD
I like to make you sit up, and watch you blinking.

PATOU
Grrrrr--in the plain interest of public decency, I say it behooves us--

THE BLACKBIRD
Don't say behooves, say it's up to you, old chap!

CHANTECLER
What's all this juggling with words?

THE BLACKBIRD
The thing, Chantecler, quite the thing! I knew a city sparrow once, and
it's the way they talk in fashionable circles.

CHANTECLER
I was well acquainted with a little red-breast, who lived beneath a city
poet's eaves; he did not talk like you.

THE BLACKBIRD
I belong to my time. Every chap that's a bit of a swell nowadays must be
a bit of a tough. It's smart, you know.

PATOU
I froth at the mouth! Smart,--there's the Peacock's password!

CHANTECLER
Oh, the Peacock, by the way, what is he doing these days?

THE BLACKBIRD
Ogling with his tail-feathers!

PATOU
Baneful his example has been to many an humble heart.

CHANTECLER
What signs do you see of his influence?

PATOU
A thousand nothings.

THE OLD HEN
[_Appearing._] Bubbles floating down the stream tell of laundresses up
stream! [_The lid drops._]

CHANTECLER
I am sure I have not seen the smallest bubble from which--

PATOU
[_Indicating a_ GUINEA-PIG, _who is passing._] See there, that
Guinea-pig--

CHANTECLER
[_Considering him._] What about him? He is just a yellow Guinea-pig!

GUINEA-PIG
[_Snippily correcting._] Khaki, if you please!

CHANTECLER
[_To_ PATOU.] Kha--?

PATOU
A bubble!--And yonder waddling duck--

CHANTECLER
[_Looking at him._] He is going to take his bath--

THE DUCK
[_Drily._] My tub!

CHANTECLER
His--?

PATOU
A bubble!

[_A long grating noise is heard within the house Crrrrrrr, then._]

THE CLOCK
Cuckoo!

THE GREY HEN
[_Leaving her hiding-place and running towards the cat-hole._] His
voice!--Now through the kitty's little door I finally shall see him!
[_She thrusts her head into the hole. The_ CUCKOO'S _call is not
repeated._] Oh, deary, deary me! I am too late! [_Calling._]
Bis! Encore!

CHANTECLER
[_Turning around at the noise._] Eh?

THE GREY HEN
[_Desperately, with her head in the cat-hole._] He has stopped!

THE BLACKBIRD
It was the half-hour.

CHANTECLER
[_Close behind the_ GREY HEN, _abruptly._] How does it happen, my love,
that we are not in the fields?

THE GREY HEN
[_Turning, scared._] Goodness gracious!

CHANTECLER
What are we doing, my love, in the cat-hole?

THE GREY HEN
[_Upset._] I was just taking a peep--

CHANTECLER
To see whom?

THE GREY HEN
[_More and more upset._] Oh--!

CHANTECLER
[_Dramatically._] Who is it?

THE GREY HEN
Oh--

CHANTECLER
Confess!

THE GREY HEN
[_In the voice of a woman caught in guilt._] The Cuckoo!

CHANTECLER
[_Amazed._] You love him?--But wherefore?

THE GREY HEN
[_Drops her eyes, then with emotion._] He is Swiss!

PATOU
A bubble!

THE GREY HEN
He is a thinker. He takes his airing--

CHANTECLER
She loves a clock!

THE GREY HEN
--always takes his airing at the same hour, like Kant.

CHANTECLER
Like what?

THE GREY HEN
Like Kant.

CHANTECLER
Did one ever--! Out of my sight!

THE BLACKBIRD
Trot, Kant you?

[THE GREY HEN _hurries off._]

CHANTECLER
Here's a pretty--Wherever did she learn that Kant--?

PATOU
At the Guinea-hen's.

CHANTECLER
That foolish old party of the crazy cries and the white-plastered beak?

PATOU
She has taken a day.

CHANTECLER
A day off, do you mean?

PATOU
No, a day at home.

CHANTECLER
A day at--Where does she receive?

THE BLACKBIRD
In a corner of the kitchen-garden.

PATOU
Under the auspices of that strawman with the unsavoury old top-hat.

CHANTECLER
The scarecrow?

THE BLACKBIRD
Yes, his being there makes the affair select.

CHANTECLER
[_Bewildered._] How is that?

THE BLACKBIRD
Don't you see? He scares off all the puny fowl--. Poor relations are not
wanted at a function.

CHANTECLER
So the Guinea-hen has a day!

PATOU
[_Phlegmatically._] A bubble!

CHANTECLER
A balloon!

THE BLACKBIRD
[_Imitating the_ GUINEA-HEN.] Mondays, my dear--

CHANTECLER
And what do they do at that feather-brain's parties?

PATOU
Cluck and cackle. The Turkey-cock airs his social gifts, the Chick gets
into society.

BLACKBIRD
[_Imitating the_ GUINEA-HEN.] From five to six--

CHANTECLER
Evening?

PATOU
No, morning.

CHANTECLER
What--?

THE BLACKBIRD
You see, she must take advantage of the time when the garden is
deserted, and yet have it a five-o'clock tea. So she chose the hour when
the old gardener is at his early potations.

CHANTECLER
What nonsense!

THE BLACKBIRD
Quite so.

PATOU
You needn't talk. You go to her teas.

CHANTECLER
He goes--?

THE BLACKBIRD
Yes, I am one of their ornaments.

PATOU
And I am not so sure but that some day--

CHANTECLER
What are you mumbling to your brass-studded collar?

PATOU
--some Hen may get you too to go!

CHANTECLER
Me?

PATOU
You!

CHANTECLER
Me?--

PATOU
Led by the end of your beak.

CHANTECLER
[_In high wrath._] Me?--

PATOU
For when a new Hen heaves in sight, you can't help yourself, you
know--you lose your balance-wheel--

THE BLACKBIRD
You slowly circumambulate the fair one--[_He imitates the_ COCK _walking
around a_ HEN.] "Yes, it's me.--Here I am!" And you say, "Coa--"

CHANTECLER
I never knew a more idiotic bird!

THE BLACKBIRD
[_Continuing to mimic him._] You let your wing hang, sentimentally--your
foot performs a sort of stately jig--[_A shot is heard._] Ha! I don't
like that!

PATOU
[_Starts up quivering, and scents the air._] Poaching Julius is at his
tricks again!

THE BLACKBIRD
Dog, it seems to stimulate you agreeably!

PATOU
[_With ears up-pricked and shining eyes._] Yes! [_Suddenly, as if
controlling himself, passionately._] No--!

THE BLACKBIRD
What affects you so?

PATOU
Oh, horrible, horrible! A poor little partridge perhaps--

THE BLACKBIRD
Is that streaming eye, my friend, a result of age or rheumatism?

PATOU
Neither! But I have within me several dogs, and there is conflict amidst
me. My hunter's nostril twitches at a shot, but, directly, my
house-dog's memory raises before me a bleeding wing, the glazing eye of
a doe, the pathos of a rabbit's dying look--and I feel the heart of a
Saint Bernard waking in my breast! [_Another shot._]

CHANTECLER
Again?



SCENE FIFTH

THE SAME, A GOLDEN PHEASANT, _later_ BRIFFAUT.


A GOLDEN PHEASANT
[_Flying suddenly over the wall, and dropping in the yard, mad with
fright._] Hide me!

CHANTECLER
Heavens!

PATOU
A golden pheasant!

GOLDEN PHEASANT
Is this great Chantecler?

THE BLACKBIRD
All over the shop, we're famous!

GOLDEN PHEASANT
[_Running hither and thither._] Save me, if you are he!

CHANTECLER
I am!--Rely on me!

[_Another shot._]

GOLDEN PHEASANT
[_Jumping and casting himself on_ CHANTECLER.] Merciful powers!

CHANTECLER
But what a nervous bird it is--a golden pheasant!

GOLDEN PHEASANT
I have no breath left! I ran too hard!-[_Faints._]

THE BLACKBIRD
Puff!--Out goes his light!

CHANTECLER
[_Upholding the_ PHEASANT _with one wing._] How beautiful he is, with
drooping neck and softly ruffled throat-feathers! [_He runs to the
drinking-trough._] Water!--One almost hesitates to dim such beauty with
a wetting--[_He splashes him vigorously with his other wing._]

THE GOLDEN PHEASANT
[_Coming to._] I am pursued! Oh, hide me!

THE BLACKBIRD
"And the villain still--" Here's melodrama!

[_To the_ PHEASANT.] How the dickens did he manage to miss you?

THE PHEASANT
Surprise!--The huntsman was looking for a little grey lark. Seeing me
rise, he cried, "Thunder!" He saw but a flash of gold, and I a flash of
fire.--But the dog is chasing me, a horrible dog--[_Seeing_ PATOU _he
quickly adds._] I am speaking of a hunting-dog! [_To_ CHANTECLER.]
Hide me!

CHANTECLER
The trouble is he is so conspicuous. That increases our dilemma. Where
can he lie concealed?--Gentle sir, my lord, most noble stranger, where
might we hope to hide the rainbow, supposing it in danger?

PATOU
There by the bench with the beehives stands my green cottage, very much
at your service.--Go in, I pray! [_The_ GOLDEN PHEASANT _goes in, but
his long tail projects._] There is too much of this golden vanity!--The
tip is still in sight.--I shall have to sit on it.

[BRIFFAUT _appears above the wall. Long hanging ears and quivering
chops._]

PATOU
[_To_ BRIFFAUT, _affecting unconcern._] Good afternoon!

BRIFFAUT
[_Snuffing._] Humph, what a good smell!

PATOU
[_Pointing to his bowl._] My poor dinner! Soup with seasonable vegetables.

BRIFFAUT
[_Hurriedly._] Have you seen a pheasant-hen go by?

PATOU
[_In astonishment, reflecting._] A pheasant-hen,--?

CHANTECLER
[_Walking about, with an assumption of gaiety._] Impressive, isn't he,
Briffaut there? with his look of a thoroughbred old Englishman!

PATOU
No, but I saw a pheasant.

BRIFFAUT
That was she!

PATOU
A pheasant-hen wears dun. This was a golden pheasant He went off towards
the meadow.

BRIFFAUT
It is she!

CHANTECLER
[_Going towards him, incredulous._] A pheasant-hen with golden plumage?

BRIFFAUT
Ah, you do not know what sometimes happens?

CHANTECLER _and_ PATOU
No.

THE BLACKBIRD
We are in for a hunting yarn!--Give me chloroform!

BRIFFAUT
It sometimes happens--the thing is exceptional, of course--My master
knows because he has read about it.--It sometimes happens--An
extraordinary phenomenon to be sure! which is likewise observed among
moor-fowl.--It happens--

PATOU
What happens?

BRIFFAUT
That the pheasant-hen--Ah, my dear fellows--!

CHANTECLER
[_Stamping with impatience._] The pheasant-hen what?--what?

BRIFFAUT
Makes up her mind one day that the cock-pheasant goes altogether too
fine. When the male in springtime puts on his holiday feathers, she sees
that he is handsomer than she--

THE BLACKBIRD
And it makes her sore!

BRIFFAUT
She leaves off laying and hatching eggs. Nature then gives her back her
purple and her gold, and the pheasant-hen proud and magnificent Amazon,
preferring to put on her back blue, green, yellow, all the colours of
the prism, rather than under a sober grey wing to shelter a brood of
young pheasants, flies freely forth--Light-mindedly she sheds the
virtues of her sex, and having done it--sees life! [_He sketches with
his paw a slightly disrespectful gesture._]

CHANTECLER
[_Dryly._] Pray, what do you know about it?

BRIFFAUT
[_Astonished._] Is he annoyed?

PATOU
[_Aside._] Already!

CHANTECLER
In short, the pheasant your master missed--

BRIFFAUT
Was a she!--[_He stops and scents the air._] Oh but!--

PATOU
[_Quickly, showing his dish._] You know, it's my dinner you smell!

BRIFFAUT
It smells very unusually good.

CHANTECLER
[_Aside._] I don't like that way his nose has of twitching.

BRIFFAUT
[_Starting upon another story._] Fancy such an instance as the following--

THE BLACKBIRD
Holy Smoke! Here comes another!--Oh, I say, hire a hall!

[_A distant whistle is heard._]

CHANTECLER
[_Quickly._] You are whistled for!

BRIFFAUT
The deuce! Good evening! [_Disappears._]

PATOU
Good evening.

CHANTECLER
Gone, at last!

BLACKBIRD
[_Calling._] Briffaut!

CHANTECLER
Great Glory, what are you doing?

THE BLACKBIRD
[_Calling._] I have something to tell you!

BRIFFAUT
[_His head reappears above the wall._] Well--?

THE BLACKBIRD
Look out, Briffaut!

CHANTECLER
[_Low to the_ BLACKBIRD.] Do you make sport of our fears?

THE BLACKBIRD
You are losing something!

BRIFFAUT
What?

THE BLACKBIRD
Time!

BRIFFAUT
[_Disappearing with a snort of fury._] Wow!




SCENE SIXTH

CHANTECLER, THE BLACKBIRD, PATOU, THE PHEASANT-HEN


CHANTECLER
[_After a moment, to the_ BLACKBIRD _who from his cage, which he has
returned, can see off over the wall._] Is he gone?

THE BLACKBIRD
He is nearly out of sight!

CHANTECLER
[_Going toward_ PATOU'S _kennel._] Madam, come forth!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Appearing at the threshold of the kennel._] Well?--A rebellious,
self-freed slave I am--even as that dog was saying! But of great
lineage, and proud as I am free--A pheasant of the woods!

THE BLACKBIRD
Whew! We hate ourself, don't we!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
In the forest where I live there comes a-poaching--

CHANTECLER
That madman who would have given to vile lead a jewel for setting!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Beneath foliage--not so thick but a sunbeam may glide in!--I make my
home. I am descended, however, from elsewhere. From whence? From Persia?
China? None can tell! But of one thing we may be certain: that I was
meant to shimmer in the blue among the fragrant gum-trees of the East,
and not to be chased through brambles by a hound!--Am I the ancient
Phoenix? or the sacred Chinese hen? Whence was I brought to this land?
And how brought? And by whom? History is not explicit on the point, and
leaves us a splendid choice. Wherefore I choose to have been born in
Colchis, from whence I came on Jason's fist. I am all gold. Perhaps I
was the Fleece!

PATOU
You?

THE PHEASANT-HEN
The Pheasant!

PATOU
[_Politely correcting her._] Pheasant-hen.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
I refer to my race, for which I stand, by token of my crimson shield.
Yes, my ancient fate of being a dead leaf beside a ruby, having appeared
to me one day too distinctly dull a lot, I stole his dazzling plumage
from the male. A good thing, too, for it becomes me so much better! The
golden tippet, as I wear it, curves and shimmers. The emerald epaulette
acquires a dainty grace. I have made of a mere uniform a miracle
of style!

CHANTECLER
She is distractingly lovely, so much is certain!

PATOU
He is never going to fall in love with a woman dressed as a man!

THE BLACKBIRD
[_Who has again hopped down from his cage._] I must go and tell the
Guinea-hen that a golden bird has blown into town. She'll have a fit!
She will invite her! [_Off._]

CHANTECLER
So you come to us from the East, like the Dawn?

THE PHEASANT-HEN
My life has the picturesque disorder of a poem. If I came from the East,
it was by way of Egypt.

PATOU
[_Aside, heart-broken._] A gypsy, on top of the rest!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_To_ CHANTECLER, _tossing and twisting her head so that the colours
ripple at her throat._] Have you noticed these two shades? They are our
own especial colours--the Dawn's and mine! Princess of the underbrush,
queen of the glade, I am pleased to wear the yellow locks of an
adventuress. Dreamy and homesick for my unknown home, I choose my
palaces among the rustling flags and withered irises that fringe the
pool. I dote upon the forest, and when it smells in autumn of dead
leaves and decaying wood--

PATOU
[_In consternation._] She is mad!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Wild as a tree-bough in a southerly gale, I tremble, flutter, spend
myself in motion, till a vast languor overtakes me--

CHANTECLER
[_Who for a minute or so has been letting his wing hang, now begins
slowly circling about the_ PHEASANT-HEN, _in the manner of the_
BLACKBIRD _aping him, with a very gentle, throaty._] Coa--[_The_
PHEASANT-HEN _looks at him. Believing himself encouraged, he takes up
again louder, while circling about her._] Coa--

THE PHEASANT-HEN
My dear sir, I prefer to tell you at once that if it is for my benefit
you are doing that--

CHANTECLER
[_Stopping short._] What?

THE PHEASANT-HEN
The eye--the peculiar gait--the drooping wing--the "Coa--"

CHANTECLER
But I--

THE PHEASANT-HEN
You do it all very nicely, I admit; only, it has not the very slightest
effect upon me!

CHANTECLER
[_Slightly abashed._] Madam--

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Oh, I understand, of course. We are the illustrious Cock! Not a Hen in
the world but preens her feathers in the hope--the very touching hope,
certainly--of offering us a moment's distraction, some day, between two
songs. We are so sure of ourself that we never hesitate, not even when
the lady is a visitor, and not quite the ordinary short-kirtled Hen whom
one can engage without further ceremony by such advances--

CHANTECLER
But--

THE PHEASANT-HEN
I do not bestow my affections quite so lightly. For my taste, anyhow,
you are altogether too frankly Cock of the Walk!

CHANTECLER
Too--?

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Spoiled! The only Cock to my fancy would be a plain inglorious Cock to
whom I should be all in all.

CHANTECLER
But--

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Love a celebrated Cock? I am not such a very woman!

CHANTECLER
But--well--still--We might, however, Madam, take a little stroll together!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Yes, like two friends.

CHANTECLER
Two friends.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Two chickens.

CHANTECLER
Very old!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Quickly._] No, no--not old! Very ugly!

CHANTECLER
[_Quicker still._] Oh, no, not ugly! [_Coming nearer to her._] Will you
take a turn in the yard?--Accept my wing!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
You shall show me the sights.

CHANTECLER
[_Stopping before the_ CHICKENS' _drinking-trough._]This, of course, is
hideous. It is a model drinking-trough on the siphon principle, made of
galvanised iron. But everything excepting that is charming, noble, time
and weather worn, from the hen-house roof to the stable door--

THE BLACKBIRD
[_Returning._] The Guinea-hen is having a fit!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_To_ CHANTECLER, _looking about her._] And so you live here untroubled,
and have nothing to fear?

CHANTECLER
Nothing whatever. Because the owner is a vegetarian An amazing man, a
lover of animals. He calls them by names borrowed from the poets. The
donkey there is Midas; the heifer, Io.

THE BLACKBIRD
The showman's on the job!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Indicating the_ BLACKBIRD.] And that?

CHANTECLER
Our humorist.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
What does he do?

CHANTECLER
Oh, he keeps busy!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Doing what?

CHANTECLER
Trying never to appear a fool, and that's hard work.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Possibly--but most unattractive! [_They move towards the back._]

THE BLACKBIRD
[_With a glance at the_ PHEASANT-HEN'S _scarlet breast._] Size up the
highfalutin' dame!--Get on to the waistcoat will you?

CHANTECLER
[_Continuing the round._] The hay-cock. The old wall. The wall, when I
sing, is alive with lizards, the hay-cock bends to listen. I sing on the
spot where you see the earth scratched up, and when I have sung, I drink
in the bowl over there.

PHEASANT-HEN
Your song then is a matter of importance?

CHANTECLER
[_Seriously._] The greatest.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Why?

CHANTECLER
That is my secret.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
If I should ask you to tell me?

CHANTECLER
[_Turning the conversation, and showing a pile of brushwood tied in
bundles._] My friends, the fagots.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Stolen from my forest!--So what they say is true?--you have a secret?

CHANTECLER
[_Dryly._] Yes, Madam.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
I suppose it would be useless to insist--

CHANTECLER
[_Climbing on the wall at the back._] And from here you can see the
remainder of the estate, to the edge of the kitchen-garden, where they
ply at evening a serpent ending like a sprinkling can.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
What?--This is all?

CHANTECLER
This is all.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
And do you imagine the world ends at your vegetable-patch?

CHANTECLER
No.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Do you never, as you watch, far overhead, the wedge of the south-flying
birds, dream of vaster horizons?

CHANTECLER
No.

PHEASANT-HEN
But all these things about you are dreary and poor and flat!

CHANTECLER
And I can never become used to the richness and wonder of these things!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
It is always the same, you must agree!

CHANTECLER
Nothing is ever the same,--nothing,--ever,--under the sun! And that
because of the sun!--For _She_ changes everything!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
She--Who?

CHANTECLER
Light, the universal goddess! That geranium planted by the farmer's wife
is never twice the same red! And that old wooden shoe, spurting straw,
what a sight, what a beautiful sight! And the wooden comb hanging among
the farmer's smocks, with the green hair of the sward caught in its
teeth! The pitchfork, stood in the corner, like a misbehaving child,
dozing as he stands and dreaming of the hay-fields! And the bowl and
skittles there,--the trim-waisted skittles, shapely maids, whose orderly
quadrilles Patou in his gambols clumsily upsets! The great worm-eaten
bowl whose curved expanse some ant is always crossing, travelling with
no less pride than famed explorers,--around her ball in 80
seconds!--Nothing, I tell you, is two instants quite the same!--And I,
sweet lady, have been so susceptible ever, that a garden-rake in a
corner, a flower in a pot, cast me long since into a helpless ecstasy,
and that from gazing at a morning-glory I fell into the startled
admiration which has made my eye so round!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Thoughtfully._] One feels that you have a soul.--A soul then may find
wherewithal to grow, so far from life and its drama, shut in by a
farmyard wall with a cat asleep on it?

CHANTECLER
With power to see, capacity to suffer, one may come Ito understand all
things. In an insect's death are hinted all disasters. Through a
knot-hole can be seen the sky and marching stars!

THE OLD HEN
[_Appearing._] None knows the heavens like the water in the well!

CHANTECLER
[_Presenting her to the _PHEASANT-HEN_ before the basket-lid drops._] My
foster-mother!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Politely approaching._] Delighted!

THE OLD HEN
[_Slyly winking at her._] He's a fine Cock!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
He is a Cock, moreover, for whom that fact is not the only thing in the
world!

CHANTECLER
[_Who has gone toward_ PATOU.] There, my dear boy, is a Hen with whom
one can have a bit of solid conversation.



SCENE SEVENTH

THE SAME, _the_ GUINEA-HEN, _and the whole_ POULTRY-YARD

_Cries outside, nearer and nearer,_ "Ah!--" _Enter all the_ HENS _in
tumult, preceded by the agitated_ GUINEA-HEN.


THE BLACKBIRD
[_In his cage._] The next course will be Guinea-hen!

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_Running to the_ PHEASANT-HEN.] Ah, my dear, my dear, my dear!--A
beauty, a very beauty!--We have come to make your acquaintance, my dear!

[_General admiration,_ "Ah!--" _The_ PHEASANT-HEN _is surrounded.
Conversation, cries, clucking._]

CHANTECLER
[_Watching the_ PHEASANT-HEN, _aside._] How well she walks, with free
and graceful gait!--[_He looks at the_ HENS.] So differently from my
Hens! [_Irritably, to the_ HENS.] Ladies, you walk as if you had
blisters! You walk as if you trod on your own eggs!

PATOU
No mistaking the symptoms! He is very much in love.

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_Presenting her son to the_ PHEASANT-HEN.] The Guinea-cock, my son.

THE YOUNG GUINEA-COCK
[_Looking admiringly at the_ PHEASANT-HEN.] What a jolly shade of blond!

A HEN
[_Disparagingly._] Like butter!

CHANTECLER
[_Turning, dryly to the_ HENS.] It is time you went indoors.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Amiably._] So soon?

CHANTECLER
They retire early.

A HEN
[_A little mortified._] Yes, we must turn in.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
They go in by a ladder!

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_To the_ PHEASANT-HEN.] Let us be great friends, my dear, shall we?

CHANTECLER
[_Looking at the_ PHEASANT-HEN, _aside._] Her sumptuous court-dress sets
her apart from the rest, and removes her far above.--My Hens
are dowdies!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_To the_ GUINEA-HEN, _excusing herself._] I return to my forest home
to-night.

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_In excessive grief._] So soon--? [_A shot in the distance._]

PATOU
They are still after game.

THE GUINEA-HEN
You must stay.

CHANTECLER
[_Eagerly._] That's it! Let us keep her a prisoner among us till to-morrow.

PHEASANT-HEN
But where can I spend the night?

PATOU
[_Indicating his kennel._] There, in my bachelor's quarters.

PHEASANT-HEN
I?--Sleep beneath a roof?

PATOU
[_Insisting._] Go in, I pray.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
But you? What shall you do?

PATOU
I shall do very well!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Resigning herself._] I will stay then until to-morrow.

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_With piercing cries._] Ah! Ah! But to-morrow, my dear! to-morrow--

ALL
[_In alarm._] What is it?

THE YOUNG GUINEA-COCK
To-morrow is my mother's day!

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_Impetuously._] My dear, would you care to come to-morrow quite
informally, and take a simple snail with us? The Peacock--

CHANTECLER
[_Mounting the ladder, from whence he can inspect the scene._] Quiet, if
you please! Evening has blown its smoke across the sky--[_In a tone of
command._] Is every one in his accustomed place?

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_Lower, to the_ PHEASANT-HEN.] The Peacock is coming. We shall hold our
little gathering among the currant-bushes.

CHANTECLER
Are the turkeys on their roost?

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_Same business._] From five to six.

CHANTECLER
Are the ducks in their pointed house?

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_Same business._] The Tortoise has kindly said we may expect her.

PHEASANT-HEN
Indeed?

CHANTECLER
[_On the last rung of the ladder._] Is every one under cover?--Every
chick under a wing?

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_Still insisting with the_ PHEASANT-HEN _that she come on the morrow._]
The Tufted Hen has promised to bring the Cock.--[_To_ CHANTECLER.]
Charmed, I am sure.

CHANTECLER
But--

THE TUFTED HEN
[_Looking out of the hen-house._] You will come, won't you, dear?

CHANTECLER
No.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_At the foot of the ladder, looking up at him._] Oh, but you will?

CHANTECLER
Why?

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Because you said "No!" to the other!

CHANTECLER
[_Wavering._] Ah!

PATOU
Humph! I beseech you--

CHANTECLER
[_Still wavering._] I--

PATOU
Humph! He is weakening.--They will make him pay dear if he yields!

THE OLD HEN
[_Appearing._] Make a reed into a pipe and play a tune upon it! [_The
basket-lid drops._]

[_Night is thickening._]

CHANTECLER
[_Still hesitating._] I--

A VOICE
Let us go to sleep--

THE TURKEY
[_On his roost, solemnly._] _Quandoque dormitat_--

THE BLACKBIRD
[_In his cage._] Dormittimus!

CHANTECLER
[_Very firmly to the_ PHEASANT-HEN.] I will not go. Good night.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Slightly offended._] Good night! [_With a curt hop she enters the
dog-kennel._]

PATOU
[_Falling asleep, stretched in front of his kennel._] Let us sleep until
the sky grows pink--pink as--as--a puppy's tummy--

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_Dropping off._] From five to six--

THE BLACKBIRD
[_Likewise dropping off._] Tew--tew--[_He nods._] tew--

CHANTECLER
[_Still at the top of the ladder._] All sleeps.--[_He spies a_ CHICK
_stealing out._] Is that a chick I see?--[_Springing after him and
driving him in._] Let me catch you!--[_In driving back the_ CHICK, _he
finds himself near the kennel. He calls very softly._] Pheasant-hen!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Lost among the straw, sleepily._] What do you want?

CHANTECLER
[_After a moment's hesitation._] Nothing.--Nothing! [_He goes back to
the top of his ladder._]

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Shall I be able to sleep, I wonder--

PATOU
[_Falling sound asleep._] A puppy's tum--

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Indistinctly, overcome by slumber._] To sleep under a roof?--I, with
my gypsy tastes?

CHANTECLER
I am going in. [_He disappears in the hen-house. He is heard saying in a
dreamy voice._] It is time to shut my--my--

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_In a last effort._]--gyp--sy--tastes.--[_Her head nods and disappears
among the straw._]

CHANTECLER
[_His voice, sleepier and fainter._]--to shut my eyes--[_Silence. He
sleeps. Two green eyes are seen suddenly kindling at the top of
the wall._]

THE CAT
And to open mine! [_Immediately two more yellow eyes shine forth from
the darkness above the hay-cock._]

A VOICE
And mine! [_Two more yellow eyes on the wall._]

ANOTHER VOICE
And mine! [_Two more yellow eyes._]

ANOTHER VOICE
And mine!



SCENE EIGHTH

_The_ POULTRY-YARD _asleep. The_ CAT _awake. Three_ SCREECH-OWLS,
_later the_ MOLE _and the_ VOICE _of the_ CUCKOO.


FIRST VOICE
Two green eyes?

THE CAT
[_Sitting up on the wall, and looking at the other phosphorescent
eyes._] Six golden eyes?

FIRST VOICE
On the wall?

THE CAT
On the rick?--[_He calls._] Owls!

THE OWLS
Cat!

THE BLACKBIRD
[_Waking up._] What's this?

THE SCREECH-OWL
[_To the_ CAT.] Great plot against him!

THE CAT
To-night?

THE THREE OWLS
To-night, too-whit!

THE CAT
Pfitt!--Where?

THE OWLS
The hollies, too-whoo!

THE CAT
What o'clock?

THE OWLS
Eight, too-whit! too-whoo!

FIRST OWL
Bats weaving soft black snares of flight--

THE CAT
Are they with us?

THE THREE OWLS
They are!

FIRST OWL
Mole, burrowing from nether to upper night--

THE CAT
Is she with us?

THE THREE OWLS
She is!

THE CAT
[_Talking toward the house-door._] You, strike your eight strokes
bravely, Cuckoo of the little clock!

THE SCREECH-OWL
Is he with us?

THE CAT
He is!--And I am pleased to tell you, silent night-watchers that some of
the day-birds are likewise with us.

THE TURKEY
[_Coming forward surrounded by a number of the barnyard constituents,
obsequiously._] So it is settled for this evening, dear Round Eyes? You
will be there?

THE OWLS
We will be there! All the Round Eyes of the neighbourhood will be there!

THE BLACKBIRD
That's a show I'd like to see!

PATOU
[_In his sleep._] Grrrrrrr--

THE CAT
[_To the startled_ NIGHT-BIRDS.] The dog is dreaming.--He growls in his
sleep.

CHANTECLER
[_Inside the hen-house._] Coa--

THE OWLS
[_Frightened._] Himself!

THE TURKEY
Fly!

FIRST OWL
No need. The night is dark. We can vanish by merely closing our eyes.
[_They shut their luminous eyes. Darkness._ CHANTECLER _appears at the
top of the ladder._]

CHANTECLER
[_To the_ BLACKBIRD.] Did you hear anything, Blackbird?

THE BLACKBIRD
I did, indeed, old chap.

THE OWLS
[_Frightened._] What's this?

THE BLACKBIRD
A black conspiracy--

CHANTECLER
Ah?

THE BLACKBIRD
[_With melodramatic emphasis._] Against you!--Tremble!

CHANTECLER
[_Going in again, unalarmed._] Joker!

THE OWLS
He has gone in.

THE BLACKBIRD
I have betrayed no one!

AN OWL
The Blackbird then is with us?

THE BLACKBIRD
No--but may I come and look on?

AN OWL
A Night-bird never eats a black bird. You can come.

THE BLACKBIRD
The password?

THE OWL
Terror and Talons!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Putting her head out of the dog-kennel._] I can't breathe in that
stifling, low-roofed little house, and--[_Catching sight of the_
NIGHT-BIRDS.] Oh!--[_She darts aside, behind the kennel, and watches._]

THE OWLS
Hush! [_They close their eyes._ THE CAT _does the same. After a time,
hearing no further sound, they open them again._] It was nothing. Let
us be off.

THE GROUP OF THE DISAFFECTED
[_With fawning obsequiousness to the_ NIGHT-BIRDS.] Success to you,
Owls,--success!

THE OWL
Thanks! But how is it that you are with us?

THE CAT
Ah, night brings out what daylight will not own to! I do not like the
Cock because the Dog does.--There you have it!

THE TURKEY
I do not like him, for the reason that having known him as a Chick I
cannot admit him as a Cock!

A DUCK
I do not like the Cock because, not being web-footed, he marks his
passage by a track of stars!

A CHICKEN
I do not like the Cock because I'm such a homely bird!

ANOTHER CHICKEN
I do not like the Cock because he has his picture painted in purple on
all the plates!

ANOTHER CHICKEN
I do not like the Cock because on all the steeples he has his statue in
gilt-bronze!

AN OWL
[_To a big overgrown_ CHICKEN.] Well, well!--And you, Capon?

THE CAPON
[_Dryly._] I do not like the Cock!

THE CUCKOO
[_Beginning to strike eight inside the house._] Cuckoo!

FIRST OWL
The hour!

CUCKOO
Cuckoo!

SECOND OWL
Let us go!

THE CUCKOO
Cuckoo!

FIRST OWL
The moon!

THE CUCKOO
Cuckoo!

FIRST OWL
Silently cleave the blue air--

THE CUCKOO
Cuckoo!

THE MOLE
[_Suddenly pushing up through the ground._]--the dark earth!

FIRST OWL
There comes the Mole!

THE CUCKOO
Cuckoo!

FIRST OWL
[_To the_ MOLE.] And you, why do you hate him?

THE MOLE
I hate him because I have never seen him!

THE CUCKOO
Cuckoo!

FIRST OWL
And you, Cuckoo, do you know why you hate him?

THE CUCKOO
[_On the last stroke._] Because he does not have to be wound up! Cuckoo!

FIRST OWL
And we do not love--

SECOND OWL
[_Hurriedly._] We are keeping the others waiting--

ALL
--the Cock, because--[_They fly off. Silence._]

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Coming slowly from behind the kennel._] I am beginning to love him!

CURTAIN





ACT SECOND

THE MORNING OF THE COCK

_Wild hillside, moss-grown and ferny, overlooking a valley with
scattered villages and winding river. Ruined wall, fragment of some
vanished terrace. Gigantic chestnut tree, rank hollies and foxgloves.
Litter suggesting neglected corner of a park: gardening implements lying
on the ground, fagots, broken flower-pots._


SCENE FIRST

_The_ NIGHT-BIRDS, _of all sorts and sizes, form a great circle,
perching in tiers on the branches, the briers, the stones; the_ CAT
_crouches in the grass; the_ BLACKBIRD _hops hither and thither on
a fagot._

_At the rise of the curtain the_ NIGHT-BIRDS _are discovered,
motionless, black shapes with closed eyes. The_ GRAND DUKE _is perched
upon a tree branch above the rest. The_ SCREECH-OWL'S _phosphorescent
eyes alone are wide open. He proceeds with the roll-call, and at every
name two great round eyes brighten in the dark._

THE SCREECH-OWL
[_Calling._] Strix! [_Two eyes light up._] Scops! [_Two more eyes light
up._] Grand-Duke! [_Two more eyes._] Metascops! [_Two more eyes._]
Minor! [_Two more eyes._]

ONE NIGHT-BIRD
[_To the other._] The Great Bubo presides.

THE SCREECH-OWL
[_Calling._] Owl of the Wall! Of the Belfry! Of the Cloister! Of the
Yew! [_At every name two more eyes have opened wide._]

A NIGHT-BIRD
[_To another just arriving._] The roll is called!

THE OTHER
I know. All there is to do is to open our eyes.

THE SCREECH-OWL
Asio! Nictea! Nyctalis! [_Three more pairs of eyes have opened._]
Brachyotus! [_No eye opening at the name, he repeats._] Brachyotus!

ONE OF THE NIGHT-BIRDS
He will be here directly. He stopped to eat a linnet.

BRACHYOTUS
[_Arriving._] Present!

THE SCREECH-OWL
Not one of them would miss, when the meeting relates to the Cock!

BRACHYOTUS
Not one!

THE SCREECH-OWL
Carine! [_Two eyes open._] Caparacoch! [_No eye opening, he repeats
emphatically._] Ca-pa-ra-coch!--Well?--Well?

CAPARACOCH
[_Arriving out of breath, opens his eyes, faltering an excuse. _] I live
a long way off!

THE SCREECH-OWL
[_Dryly._] You should have started the earlier! [_Looking around._] We
are all present, I believe. [_Calling._] Flammeolus! And Flammeoline!
[_All the eyes are now open._]

THE GRAND-DUKE
[_Solemnly._] Before beginning, let us give, but not too loud, the cry
which makes us all as one!

ALL
  Long live the Night!

_And in a weird, savage, hurried chorus, interspersed with hoots and
flapping of wings, all talking together and rocking themselves in
hideous glee._


THE GRAND-DUKE
  Praise the Night, discreet, propitious,
  When with wadded wing and muted
    O'er the sleeping world we fly,
  And the partridge in the bracken
  Ne'er suspects the hovering presence
    Till we pounce without a cry.

THE SCREECH-OWL
  Praise the Night, convenient, secret,
  When in slaughtering baby rabbits
    We can do it at our ease,
  Daub the grass with blood in comfort,
  Spare the pains to look like heroes,
    Be ourselves where no one sees!

AN OLD HORNED-OWL
  Praise the density of darkness!

A WOOD-OWL
  The intensity of stillness
    Letting crunching bones be heard!

A BARN-OWL
  Freshness pleasantly contrasting
  With the genial warmth of blood drops
    Spurting from a strangled bird!

THE WOOD-OWL
  Praise the black rock oozing terror!

THE SCREECH-OWL
  And the cross-roads where our screeches,
    Furrowing the startled air,
  Our demoniac yelling, hooting,
  Make the hardened unbeliever
    Cross himself and fall to prayer!

THE GRAND-DUKE
  Praise the snares of the great Weaver,
  Night, whose only fault or weakness
    Is her tolerance of stars!

THE SCREECH-OWL
  For spectators are not wanted
  At the work of plucking fledglings--
    Be they Jupiter and Mars!

THE GRAND-DUKE
  Praise the Night, when we take vengeance
  On the goldfinch for his beauty,
    On the titmouse for his grace!
  When the darkness takes possession
  Let them tremble, those confiding
    Hostages of Day's!

THE WOOD-OWL
  For there is a choice in murder!

THE GRAND-DUKE
  And the inkier the blackness
    All the clearer do we see
  To select the whitest pigeon
  In the dove-cote, and the bluest
    Blue jay on the shuddering tree!

THE BARN-OWL
  Praise the hour and taste and relish
  Of the eggs we suck, destroying
    Hopes of many a haughty line!

THE SCREECH-OWL
  And the councils where in whispers
  We prepare what shall resemble
    Accidents by every sign!

THE GRAND-DUKE
  Praise the shadow's grim suggestions!
  The advantage over others
    We inherit through their fright!

THE SCREECH-OWL
  For our grisly cachinnations
  Give the very eagle goose-flesh--

ALL TOGETHER
    Praise our patroness, the Night!

THE GRAND-DUKE
And now let the Screech-Owl in his russet robe take the floor.

SEVERAL VOICES
Silence!

THE BLACKBIRD
[_On his fagot._] What an awf'ly lovely evening party!

THE SCREECH-OWL
[_Oratorically._] Brethren of the Night--

THE GRAND-DUKE
[_To the_ OWL _next to him._] The meeting-place seems to me particularly
well chosen. The blackest spot, the moldiest tree. To the right, old
postherds. To the left, in the dark between the hollies--the view!

THE SCREECH-OWL
Brethren of the Night!--

AN OWL
There comes the Mole!

SEVERAL VOICES
Silence!

THE OWL
She must have taken, to come here, a route below the roots of the
daisies--

THE BLACKBIRD
The subway, what else?

THE GRAND-DUKE
[_To his neighbor._] Is that the Blackbird?

THE BLACKBIRD
[_Coming forward._] Yes, your Grace. And the two agate balls over there
are the Cat.

THE GRAND-DUKE
I can hear him licking his paws.

THE SCREECH-OWL
[_Resuming._] Brethren of the Night! Inasmuch as everybody here--and we
plume ourselves upon it!--is possessed of the evil eye--

ALL THE BIRDS
[_Chuckling and rocking in their peculiarly disgusting and
characteristic fashion._] Ha, ha!

THE GRAND-DUKE
[_Spreading his wings to demand silence._] Hush! [_All return to their
appalling stillness._]

THE BLACKBIRD
My eye is merely roguish. I am here to look on, you know, without taking
sides,--in the artist spirit, that's all.

AN OWL
If you are not taking sides, then you are siding with us!

THE BLACKBIRD
Oh, I say, what a primitive notion!

THE SCREECH-OWL
[_Completing his sentence._] Let us express ourselves with simple and
direct malevolence: the Cock is a robber!

ALL
A robber! He robs us!

THE BLACKBIRD
Now, what the--Robs you of what?

THE GRAND-DUKE
Of health! Gladness!

THE BLACKBIRD
How is that?

THE SCREECH-OWL
By his crowing!

THE GRAND-DUKE
His crowing brings on enlargement of the spleen and pericarditis! For it
heralds--

THE BLACKBIRD
[_Hopping about._] Oh, I see--The light!

[_All make a violent motion in his direction; the_ BLACKBIRD
_frightened, hides among the fagots._]

THE GRAND-DUKE
[_Emphatically._] Never speak that word! When that word is spoken, Night
at the horizon feels a crawling discomfort, a titillation underneath
her wing.

THE BLACKBIRD
[_Cautiously correcting himself._] The brightness of--[_General start
of dismay repeated; the_ BLACKBIRD _again dodges behind the fagots._]

AN OWL
[_Hurriedly._] Never utter that horrible grating word, which so
hatefully suggests the scratching of a match!

THE SCREECH-OWL
You should express yourself: The Cock heralds the folding back of the
pall--

THE BLACKBIRD
But the day--[_Start and threatening gesture from all._]

ALL
[_In voices of unspeakable anguish._] Not that word!

THE GRAND-DUKE
You must refer to it as "that which will be!"

THE BLACKBIRD
What difference does it make whether or not he heralds the--

ALL
[_Stopping him._] Ha!

THE BLACKBIRD
--the folding back of the pall, since that which will be--will be!

THE GRAND-DUKE
[_In tones of despair._] Simple torture it is to hear a brazen throat
forever reminding you of what you know to be only too true!

ALL
[_Writhing in pain._] Too true! Too true!

THE GRAND-DUKE
He begins while the night is still pleasant and cool--

CRIES ON ALL SIDES
He is a robber, a thief!

THE GRAND-DUKE
He cheats us!

ALL THE OWLS
He cheats us! Cheats us!

THE GRAND-DUKE
Of the good bit of night there still is left.

AN OWLET
He compels us to leave our posts beside the warrens--

THE SCREECH-OWL
Our feasts of steaming flesh!

THE WOOD-OWL
The witches' routs where we ride perched on the fist of a hag!

THE GRAND-DUKE
After cock-crow an Owl is no longer in his normal state--

THE SCREECH-OWL
He does evil in a hurry!

THE GRAND-DUKE
And bungles it in consequence!

THE OLD HORNED-OWL
As soon as the Cock has crowed all becomes temporary provisional--

THE BARN-OWL
Though the Night be still black, we are painfully aware of it growing
less and less black!

THE SCREECH-OWL
When his metallic voice has cleft the night, we squirm like a worm in a
fruit that is cut in two.

THE BLACKBIRD
[_On his fagot, mystified._] The other Cocks, however--

THE GRAND-DUKE
Their song creates no uneasiness. It is his song which must be silenced.

ALL THE NIGHT-BIRDS
[_Flapping their wings, in a long lament._] Silenced! Silenced!

AN OWL
How can it be accomplished?

THE SCREECH-OWL
The Blackbird here has worked in our cause.

THE BLACKBIRD
Who--I?

THE SCREECH-OWL
Yes, you laughed at him.

ALL
[_Cackling._] Ha, ha!

THE GRAND-DUKE
[_Spreading his wings._] Hush! [_They resume their sinister stillness._]

THE SCREECH-OWL
But his song has not acted any the less directly on our gall-bladders
for the fun that has been made of him. He has grown stronger than ever
since he was found ridiculous.

ALL
What shall we do?

THE SCREECH-OWL
The Peacock, that great booby--

ALL
[_Cackling and rocking._] Ha, ha!

THE GRAND-DUKE
[_Opening his wings._] Hush! [_All instantly motionless._]

THE SCREECH-OWL
Through the Peacock, likewise working in our cause, the Cock came out of
fashion. But his song is just as inconvenient, in fashion or out of it.
He is all the more proudly uncompromising for no longer being in style.

ALL
What shall we do?

AN OWL
Cut his throat!

CRIES
Death to the Cock!

AN OWL
Death to that aristocrat posing as a democrat and socialist!

ANOTHER
With spurs on his heels, but a liberty cap on his head!

THE GRAND-DUKE
Night-birds all, arise!

[ALL, _arising with outspread wings and glaring eyes, increase
enormously in size. The night appears doubly dark._]

THE BLACKBIRD
[_With unabated lightness._] Midnight to the fore!

THE SCREECH-OWL
Kill him! But how can we, when our eyes cease to see the moment he comes
out?

ALL
[_Wailing like an ancient chorus._] Woe!

THE OLD HORNED-OWL
[_Craftily._] How kill--from afar?

THE GRAND-DUKE
By means of what secret spring?

A VOICE
[_From the tree._] Duke, may I lay a plan before the assembly?

THE GRAND-DUKE
Scops! Let us hear!

ALL
[_At sight of a small_ OWL _dropping from a bough, and coming forward
with tiny hops._] Scops, dear little Scops!

SCOPS
[_Bowing before the_ GRAND-DUKE.] You are aware, mighty
Blind-by-day-and-seer-by-night, that in pleasant gardens up yonder hill
a breeder of birds--termed aviculturist, raises for exhibitions--termed
agricultural, the most magnificent Cocks of the most extraordinary
varieties. Now, that great discoverer of rare birds, the Peacock, who,
possessing a voice which pierces the ear-drum cannot abide a voice which
pierces the darkness--the Peacock, whose specialty it is to confer
celebrity upon every strange beast--

THE GRAND-DUKE
[_To his neighbour._] From every strange region!

SCOPS
Cherishes the dream of presenting these same Cocks to-morrow, in the
kitchen garden, at the--

ALL TOGETHER
[_Laughing._] Guinea-hen's!

SCOPS
And launching among her set these Birds whose glory will be the
finishing blow to the glory of Chantecler.

THE BLACKBIRD
Flatten him out like a pan cake!

THE SCREECH OWL
But those Cocks are always locked in!

SCOPS
I am coming to that. This evening, when a maid, having entered their
wire-netted close, was scattering corn in a golden shower, I started up
suddenly from the hollow of a pollard willow, and the girl--

AN OWL
[_To his neighbour._] What a bright mind, our little Scops!

SCOPS
At sight of the ill-omened bird--

ALL
[_Cackling and rocking._] Ha, ha!

THE GRAND-DUKE
[_Spreading his wings._] Hush! [_All suddenly still._]

SCOPS
Fled, with one arm across her eyes! The cage was left open, and the
whole fantastic host will meet Chantecler to-morrow at the--

ALL
[_With peals of laughter._] Guinea-hen's!

THE BLACKBIRD
He is not going. He has refused.

SCOPS
The devil!

THE CAT
[_Quietly._] Go on, Scops. He will be there.

THE BLACKBIRD
[_Looking at him from a distance._] What do you know about it, pocket
panther?

THE CAT
I saw a Pheasant-hen exciting his admiration, and I saw that he would
go.

THE BLACKBIRD
It's when you're sound asleep that you see everything!

THE GRAND-DUKE
[_To_ SCOPS.] Very well, then, let us suppose him going.

SCOPS
Chantecler, for all his fame, has retained his bluff country squire's
frankness. When he sees this--

THE BLACKBIRD
[_Prompting._] Tea-fight--

SCOPS
And the contortions of those--

THE BLACKBIRD
[_Same business._] Snobs--

SCOPS
In the presence of those--

THE BLACKBIRD
[_Same business._] Big guns--

SCOPS
He is sure to say things which they are equally sure to take up.

THE GRAND-DUKE
[_Thrilled._] And do you believe that a cock-fight--?

SCOPS
Such is my fond hope.

THE CAT
But listen, Scops. Suppose Chantecler should win?

SCOPS
Know, Angora, that there will be among those fancy cocks a genuine
game-cock, lean, with tawny wing, the same who--

THE BLACKBIRD
[_Seeing the_ OWLS _puff out their feathers for joy._] Sensation among
the audience!

SCOPS
The same who has defeated the most famous champions--the White Pile.
And as this victor in Flemish and English encounters wears at his heels,
for the defter dispatching of his enemy, two razors fastened there by
the ingenuity of man, by tomorrow night Chantecler will be dead, and his
eyes picked out of their sockets.

THE SCREECH-OWL
[_Enthusiastically._] We will go and gloat over his corpse!

THE GRAND-DUKE
[_Risen to his full height, formidable._] And his comb, which looked
above his forehead like an incarnate bit of scarlet dawn, we will take
his comb,--our dearest dream at length fulfilled!--and we will eat it!

ALL
[_With a yell, which ends in their ferocious cackling and rocking._] And
we will eat it,--eat it, ha, ha!

THE GRAND-DUKE
[_Spreading his wings._] Hush! [_Dead silence._]

SCOPS
And after that--

THE BLACKBIRD
[_Hopping._] It's quite a tidy proposition as it stands--

SCOPS
What?

THE BLACKBIRD
Your scheme! By Jingo, if I were the sort of bird to take things
solemnly, I would go straight to the Cock and tell him. But I will do
nothing of the sort. [_He concludes, with four little hops._] For I
know--that all this--will turn out--beautifully!

SCOPS
[_Ironically._] Beautifully indeed! [_He continues in growing
excitement._] And after that, if those absurd Cocks of far-fetched
breeds have not by to-morrow evening gone back to their cages, we will
eat them all, no longer good for anything!

THE GRAND-DUKE
[_In his neighbour's ear._] And after that we will eat the Blackbird for
dessert.

THE BLACKBIRD
[_Who has not caught the last sentence._] What did he say?

SCOPS
[_Quickly._] Nothing! [_In a still increasing frenzy of glee._] And
after that--

[_In the distance: Cock-a-doodle-doo! Instant silence. _SCOPS_ stops
short and collapses, as if mown down. All the puffed _OWLS_ appear
suddenly to have grown thin._]

ALL
[_Looking at one another and blinking._] What is it? What was that?
[_They hastily spread their wings and call to one another for flight._]
Grand-Duke! Minor! Minimus!

THE BLACKBIRD
[_Hopping from one to the other._] Going? So soon? Why, what's your
hurry?

VOICE
[_Of one of the_ NIGHT-BIRDS _calling to another._] Nyctalis!

THE BLACKBIRD
It's hours before daybreak. Oceans of time, you have!

AN OWL
Asio, are you coming?

ANOTHER OWL
[_Calling._] Nictea!

ANOTHER
[_Fluttering up to him._] Yes, my dear! [_They all stagger and trip over
their wings._]

THE BLACKBIRD
What makes them stumble?

THE NIGHT-BIRDS
[_Winking and blinking with marked evidences of pain._] Oh, how it
hurts! Ow! Ow!

THE BLACKBIRD
Lightning opthalmia, I declare! [_One by one the_ OWLS _fly off._]

THE GRAND-DUKE
[_The last to go, spins on himself with a cry of pain and rage._] How
does he contrive, that pernicious Cock, to have a voice that fairly puts
out your eyes! [_He heavily flaps off._]

VOICES OF THE NIGHT-BIRDS
[_In the distance._] Strix!

THE BLACKBIRD
[_Looking after them among the branches, and later in the blue space
over the valley._] They are calling one another!

VOICE IN THE DISTANCE
Scops!

THE BLACKBIRD
[_Bending over the valley, where the dark wings are dwindling and
fading._] They wheel--waver--dip--

VOICES
[_Dying in the distance._] Owl of the Wall! Of the Belfry! Of the Yew!

THE BLACKBIRD
Gone! [_He looks about, gives a hop, and with an immediate return to
levity._] But it's supper-time.--Now for a bite of cold grasshopper!
[_The_ PHEASANT-HEN _suddenly flies over the brushwood tangle, dropping
beside him._] You!



SCENE SECOND

THE BLACKBIRD, THE PHEASANT-HEN, _later_ CHANTECLER


THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Panting, tragically earnest._] I ran all the way.--You were
there.--Oh, I am half dead with terror!--Well you must have overheard
their dreadful secret! You, his friend!

THE BLACKBIRD
[_Cheerfully rummaging among the moss._] Or the thigh of a katydid will
do.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
I was watching from a distance. I crouched in a ditch--[_In an anguished
voice._] Well?

THE BLACKBIRD
[_In genuine surprise._] Well, what?

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Their conspiracy--

THE BLACKBIRD
[_Calmly._] It all went off very nicely.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
What do you mean?

THE BLACKBIRD
The shadow was a correct and appropriate blue, and the Owls said
perfectly characteristic things.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_In wild alarm._] Heavens, they plotted his death?

THE BLACKBIRD
His decease, which is not nearly so bad.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
But--

THE BLACKBIRD
Don't smite your brow! In spite of the Screech-Owl's grave and
self-important tone, I shouldn't wonder if it all amounted to
very little.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Those Owls--

THE BLACKBIRD
Are good enough in their various parts, but it's the old excessive style
of acting.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
I beg your pardon?

THE BLACKBIRD
Back numbers!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Oh?

THE BLACKBIRD
They have eyelashes, fancy, all the way round their eyes! It's too much
of a good thing, really.--And that black plot, those desperately dark
designs, all that belongs to the year one; you can see moss growing
on its back!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Fluttering hither and thither feverishly._] I am never quite sure of
understanding when a person is talking in fun.

THE BLACKBIRD
[_Winking at her._] No flies on your acting!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Surely you wouldn't be laughing if he were in danger? Those ruffians--?

THE BLACKBIRD
Prattlers! Wooden Swords! Knights of Hot Air!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
But Scops--?

THE BLACKBIRD
A stuffed Owl!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
And the Great Bubo--?

THE BLACKBIRD
Just two ten-candle-power lamps, to be turned on and off with a
switch,--crick-crack! And Flammeolus, two lamps likewise--but acetylene!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Bewildered by his imagery._] And so--?

THE BLACKBIRD
No, trembling Gypsy, there's not enough in this great plot to choke a
flea withal!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Truly? I have been so horribly afraid--

THE BLACKBIRD
Fear, I warn you, lovely Zingara, leads to dyspepsia! It's because he
keeps his eye closed and buried in the sand that the ostrich has
preserved his famous digestion!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
So it might seem.

THE BLACKBIRD
We have in these latter days bowed Tragedy respectfully out of the
house!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
But had we not best warn Chantecler, so that--

THE BLACKBIRD
He would go instantly and challenge them. And then such a whetting of
steel!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
You are right. So he would.

THE BLACKBIRD
On your principle, mad Gitana, an oak-gall could be made into a world.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
You have much good sense.

THE BLACKBIRD
Daughter of the forest, I have.

CHANTECLER'S VOICE
[_Outside._] Coa--

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Chantecler!

CHANTECLER
[_Approaching on the left, between the hollies, calls from afar._] Who
is there?

THE PHEASANT-HEN
It is I!

CHANTECLER
[_Still from a distance._] Alone?

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_With a significant look at the_ BLACKBIRD.] Yes, alone.

THE BLACKBIRD
[_Understanding._] I vanish--I am off to supper.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Low to the_ BLACKBIRD.] And so--?

THE BLACKBIRD
[_Motioning her to be silent._] Keep it dark! [_As he is leaving, by the
right, in the manner of one giving an order to a waiter._] Earwigs
for one!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Low._] It is wiser, you think, not to tell him?

THE BLACKBIRD
[_Before disappearing among the flower-pots._] Well, rather!



SCENE THIRD

THE PHEASANT-HEN, CHANTECLER.

CHANTECLER
[_Who has reached the_ PHEASANT-HEN'S _side._] Out so early?

THE PHEASANT-HEN
To see the daybreak.

CHANTECLER
[_With repressed emotion._] Ah--?

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Teasingly._] What troubles you?

CHANTECLER
I have had a wretched night.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
So sorry! [_A pause._]

CHANTECLER
Are you going to the Guinea-hen's?

THE PHEASANT-HEN
I stayed over solely for that purpose.

CHANTECLER
Ah, yes, I know. [_A pause._] I dislike her extremely.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Come to her party.

CHANTECLER
No.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
As you please. Then we may as well say good-bye.

CHANTECLER
No.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Come to the Guinea-hen's. We shall have a chance to see something of
each other there.

CHANTECLER
No.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
You are determined not to come?

CHANTECLER
I am coming--but I hate it.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Why?

CHANTECLER
It is weak.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
No, no! That is no great sign of weakness!

CHANTECLER
Ah--?

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Softly, coming closer to him._] What would be showing a sweet,
delightful, and fully masculine weakness--

CHANTECLER
[_In alarm at her approach._] What?

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Would be to tell me your secret. Oh, just a wee bit!

CHANTECLER
[_With a start._] The secret of my song?

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Yes.

CHANTECLER
Golden Hen, my secret--

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Coaxingly._] Often from the edge of the woods I hear you in the first
golden glimmer of day--

CHANTECLER
[_Flattered._] My song has reached your shapely little ear?

THE PHEASANT-HEN
It has!

CHANTECLER
[_Abruptly, moving away from her._] My secret--Never!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
You are not very gallant!

CHANTECLER
No--I am full of conflict and misery.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Languidly reciting._] The Cock and the Pheasant-hen a Fable--

CHANTECLER
[_Half aloud._] A Cock loved a Pheasant-hen--

THE PHEASANT-HEN
And would not tell her anything--

CHANTECLER
Moral--

THE PHEASANT-HEN
It was horrid of him!

CHANTECLER
[_Pressing close to her._] Moral: Your dress has the fascinating rustle
of silk!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Moral: I dislike familiarity! [_Withdrawing from him._] Go home to your
Hen of the plebeian petticoat!

CHANTECLER
[_Stamping._] I shall be angry!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
No, no, don't be angry--Say "Coa--" [_They stand bill to bill._]

CHANTECLER
[_Angrily._] Coa--

THE PHEASANT-HEN
No, no! Say it nicely--

CHANTECLER
[_In a long, tender coo._] Coa--

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Look at me without laughing. Your secret--

CHANTECLER
Well?

THE PHEASANT-HEN
You are dying to tell it to me!

CHANTECLER
Yes, I feel that I shall tell, and I know I shall do ill in telling. And
it's all because of the gold on her dainty little head! [_Going
brusquely nearer to her._] Shall you prove worthy, at least, of having
been chosen? Is your breast true red to the core?

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Now tell me!

CHANTECLER
Look at me, Pheasant-hen, and try, if indeed it be possible, try to
recognise, by yourself, sign by sign, the vocation of which my body is
the symbol. Guess, to begin with, at my destiny from my shape, and see
how, curved like a sort of living hunting-horn, I am as much formed for
sound to turn and gain volume within me, as the wild duck is formed to
swim!--Wait!--Mark the fact that, impatient and proud, scratching up the
earth with my claws, I appear always to be seeking something in
the soil--

THE PHEASANT-HEN
You are seeking for grains of corn, seeds, I suppose.

CHANTECLER
Never! I have never looked for such things. I find them occasionally,
into the bargain, but disdainfully I give them to my Hens.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Well, then, in your perpetual scratching, what is it you are looking
for?

CHANTECLER
The right spot! For always before singing I carefully choose my stand.
Pray, observe--

THE PHEASANT-HEN
True, and then you ruffle your feathers.

CHANTECLER
I never start to sing until my eight claws, after clearing a space of
weeds and stones, have found the soft, dark turf underneath. Then,
placed in direct contact with the good earth, I sing!--And that is
already half the mystery, Pheasant-hen, half the mystery of my song,
which is not of those songs one sings after composing them, but is
received straight from the native soil, like sap! And the time above all
when that sap arises in me,--the hour, briefly, in which I have genius,
in which I can never doubt I have!--is the hour when dawn falters on the
boundaries of the dark sky. Then, filled with the same quivering as
leaves and grass, thrilled to the very tips of my wing quills, I feel
myself a chosen instrument. I accentuate my curve of a hunting-horn,
Earth speaks in me as in a conch, and ceasing to be an ordinary bird, I
become the mouthpiece, in some sort official, through which the cry of
the earth escapes toward the sky!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Chantecler!

CHANTECLER
And that cry which rises from the earth, that cry is such a cry of love
for the light, is such a deep and frenzied cry of love for the golden
thing we call the Day, and that all thirst to feel again: the pine on
its bark, the tortuous roots in woodland paths on their mosses, the
feather-grass on each delicate spray, the tiniest pebble in its tiniest
mica flake; it is so wonderfully the cry of all that misses and mourns
its colour, its reflection, its flame, its coronet, its pearl; the
beseeching cry of the dew-washed meadow begging for a wee rainbow at
every grass-tip, of the forest begging a burst of fire at the end of
each gloomy avenue; that cry which mounts to the sky through me is so
greatly the cry of all that feels itself in disgrace, plunged in a
sunless pit, deprived of light without knowing for what offence; is the
cry of cold, the cry of fear, the cry of weariness, of all that night
disables or disarms; the rose shivering alone in the dark, the hay
wanting to be dried and go to the mow, the sickle forgotten out of doors
by the reaper and fearing it will rust in the grass, the white things
dismayed at not looking white; is so greatly the cry of the innocent
among beasts, who have nothing to conceal, of the brook fain to show its
crystal clearness; and even--for thy very works, O Night, disown
thee!--of the puddle longing to glisten, the mud longing to become earth
again, by drying; it is so greatly the magnificent cry of the field
impatient to feel its wheat and barley growing, of the blossoming tree
mad for still more blossoms of the green grapes craving a purple side;
of the bridge waiting for footsteps, for shadows of birds among shadows
of branches; the voice of all that yearns to sing, to drop the garb of
mourning, live again, serve again, be a brink, be a bourn, a sun-warm
seat, a stone glad to comfort with warmth the hand touching, or the
insect overcrawling it; finally, it is so greatly the cry toward the
light of all Beauty, all Health, all which wishes, in sunshine and joy,
to see its work while doing it, and do it to be seen--And when I feel
that vast call to the Day arising within me, I so expand my soul to make
it more sonorous, by making it more spacious, that the great cry may
still be increased in greatness; before giving it, I withold it in my
soul a moment so piously; then, when, to expel it, I contract my soul, I
am so convinced of accomplishing a great act, I have such faith that my
song will make night crumble like the walls of Jericho--

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Frightened._] Chantecler!

CHANTECLER
And sounding its victory beforehand, my song springs forth so clear, so
proud, so peremptory, that the horizon, seized with a rosy
trembling--_obeys!_

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Chantecler!

CHANTECLER
I sing! Vainly Night offers to compromise, offers a dubious twilight--I
sing again! And suddenly--

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Chantecler!

CHANTECLER
I fall back, blinded by the red light bathing me, dazzled at having, I,
the Cock, made the Sun to rise!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Then the whole secret of your song--?

CHANTECLER
Is that I dare assume that the East without me must rest in idleness! I
sing, not to hear the echo repeat, a shade fainter, my song! I think of
light and not of glory! Singing is my fashion of waging war and bearing
witness. And if my song is the proudest of songs, it is that I sing
clearly to make the day rise clear!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
What he says sounds slightly mad!--You are responsible for the rising
of--

CHANTECLER
That which opens flower, eye, soul, and window! Certainly! My voice
dispenses light! And when the sky is grey, the reason is that I have
sung badly.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
But when you sing by day?

CHANTECLER
I am practising, or else promising the ploughshare, the hoe, the harrow,
the scythe, not to neglect my duty of waking them.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
But what wakens you?

CHANTECLER
The fear of forgetting.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
And you believe that at the sound of your voice the whole world is
suffused--?

CHANTECLER
I have no clear idea of the whole world. But I sing for my own valley,
and desire that every Cock may do the same for his.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Still--

CHANTECLER
But here I stand, explaining, perorating, and forgetting altogether to
make my dawn.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
His dawn!

CHANTECLER
Ah, what I say sounds mad? I will make the dawn before your very eyes!
And the wish to please you adding its ardour to the ordinary forces of
my soul, I shall rise in singing, as I feel, to unusual heights, and the
dawn will rise more fair to-day than ever it rose before!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
More fair?

CHANTECLER
Assuredly,--in just the measure that strength is added to the song by
the knowledge of listeners, boldness to the exploit by the consciousness
of lovely watching eyes--[_Taking his stand upon a hillock at the back,
overlooking the valley._] Now, Madam!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Gazing at his outline against the sky._] How beautiful he is!

CHANTECLER
Look attentively at the sky. Already it has paled. The reason is that a
short while back, with my earliest crow I ordered the sun to stand in
readiness just below the horizon.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
He is so beautiful that what he says almost seems possible!

CHANTECLER
[_Talking toward the horizon._] Ha, Sun, I feel you just behind there,
stirring--and I laugh with pride and joy amidst my scarlet
wattles--[_Rising on tiptoe suddenly, in a voice of startling
loudness._] Cock-a-doodle-doo!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
What great breath lifts his breast-feathers?

CHANTECLER
[_Toward the east._] Obey!--I am the Earth, and I am Labour! My comb is
the pattern of a forge fire, and the voice of the furrow rises to my
throat! [_Whispering mysteriously._] Yes, yes, month of July--

THE PHEASANT-HEN
To whom is he speaking?

CHANTECLER
You shall have it earlier than April! [_Bending to right and left,
encouragingly._] Yes, Bramble!--Yes, Brake!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
He is magnificent!

CHANTECLER
[_To the_ PHEASANT-HEN.] You see, I must at all times
remember--[_Stroking the earth with his wing._] Yes, dear
Grass!--remember the humble prayers whose interpreter I become.
[_Talking to invisible things._] The golden ladder?--I understand! that
you may all dance on it together!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
To whom are you promising a ladder?

CHANTECLER
To the Motes--Cock-a-doodle-doo!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Watching the sky and landscape._] A shiver of blue runs across the
thatched roofs.--A star went out just then--

CHANTECLER
No, it veiled itself. Even by daylight the stars are there.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
You do not extinguish them?

CHANTECLER
I extinguish nothing! But you shall see how great I am at kindling!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Oh, I see a dawning of--

CHANTECLER
What do you see?

THE PHEASANT-HEN
The blue is no longer blue!

CHANTECLER
I told you! It is already green!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
The green is turning to orange--

CHANTECLER
You will have been the first this morning to see the transformation!

[_The distant plain takes on velvety purplish hues._]

THE PHEASANT-HEN
It all seems to end in leagues of purple heather.

CHANTECLER
[_Whose crow is beginning to tire._] Cock-a-doo--

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Oh--yellow among the pine trees!

CHANTECLER
Gold it ought to be,--gold!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
And pearly grey--

CHANTECLER
It shall be white!--I haven't done it yet! Cock-a-doodle-doo--It's very
bad so far, but I won't give up!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Every hollow in every tree is pink as a wild rose--

CHANTECLER
[_With growing enthusiasm._] Since love lends me strength in addition to
faith, I say the Day to-day shall be more beautiful that the Day!--Do
you see? Do you see the eastern sky at my voice dappling itself
with light?

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Lured along and half persuaded by the madness of the_ COCK.] Such a
thing might be, after all, since love is involved in the mystery!

CHANTECLER
Resume, horizon, at my command, your fringe of little poplars!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Bending over the valley._] There emerges from the shadow, gradually, a
world of your creation--

CHANTECLER
Sacred things you are witnessing--To sacred things I am initiating
you!--Define your outlines, distant hills! Pheasant-hen, do you love me?

THE PHEASANT-HEN
We shall always love to be in the secret of the Makers of Dawn!

CHANTECLER
You help me to sing better. Come closer. Collaborate.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Springing to his side._] I love you!

CHANTECLER
Every word you whisper in my ear shall be translated into sunshine for
all the world to see!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
I love you!

CHANTECLER
Say it again, and I will gild that mountain suddenly!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Wildly._] I love you!--Let me see you gild it!

CHANTECLER
[_In his greatest, most splendid manner._] Cock-a-doodle-doo! [_The
mountain turns golden._]

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Pointing to the lower ranges, still purple._] But the hills?

CHANTECLER
Each in its turn. To the highest peaks belong the earliest rays!
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Ah!--across yonder drowsing slope a stealing gleam--

CHANTECLER
[_Joyously._] I dedicate it to you!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
The distant villages are coming into view.

CHANTECLER
Cock-a--[_His voice breaks._]

THE PHEASANT-HEN
You are weary!

CHANTECLER
[_Stiffening himself._] I refuse to be! [_Wildly._] Cock-a-doodle-doo!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Exhausted!

CHANTECLER
Do you see those tatters of mist still clinging? Cock-a-doodle-doo!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
You will kill yourself!

CHANTECLER
I only live, dear, when I am killing myself giving great splendid cries!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Pressing close to his side._] I am proud of you!

CHANTECLER
[_With emotion._] Your head bows--

THE PHEASANT-HEN
I listen to the Day arising in your breast! I delight to hear first in
your lungs what by-and-by will be purple and gold on the mountain sides!

CHANTECLER
[_While the little distant houses begin to smoke in the dawn._] I
dedicate to you moreover those reawakened farmsteads. Man offers
trinkets, I--wreaths and plumes of smoke!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Looking off._] I can see your work growing,--growing in the distance.

CHANTECLER
[_Looking at her._] I can see it in your eyes!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Over the meadows--

CHANTECLER
On your throat--[_In a smothered voice._] Oh, it is exquisite!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
What?

CHANTECLER
I am at once doing my duty, and making you more fair. I am gilding my
valley, while brightening your wing. [_Tearing himself from love, and
dashing toward the right._] But the shadow still fights all along the
line of retreat. There is much to be done over there! Cock-a-doodle-doo!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Looking up at the sky._] Oh, look!

CHANTECLER
[_Looking too, sadly._] How can I prevent it? The morning star is fading
out!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_In a tone of regret for the little bright spark which the growing
light must necessarily quench._] It is fading out--

CHANTECLER
Alas!--But shall we therefore despond? [_And tearing himself from
melancholy, he springs toward the left._] There is still much to do over
here. Cock-a--[_At this point the crowing of other_ COCKS _ascends from
the valley._ CHANTECLER _listens, then softly._] Hark! Do you hear
them now?

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Who dare--?

CHANTECLER
The other Cocks.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Bending above the plain._] They are singing in the rosy light--

CHANTECLER
Yes, they believe in the light as soon as they see it.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
They sing all in a haze of blue--

CHANTECLER
I sang in total blackness. My song rose from the cheerless shade, and
was the first to rise. It is when Night prevails that it's fine to
believe in the Light!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
How dare they sing when you are singing?

CHANTECLER
Let them sing! Their songs acquire significance from mingling with mine,
and their tardy but numerous cries unconsciously hasten the flight of
the dark. [_Straightening upon his hillock, he calls to the distant_
COCKS.] Now, all together!

CHANTECLER AND ALL THE COCKS
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

CHANTECLER
[_Alone, with familiar cordiality._] Forward, forward, boldly, Day!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Beside him, stamping her feet._] Boldly, Day!

CHANTECLER
[_Crying encouragements to the Light._] Yes, there, there before you, is
a roof for you to gild! Come, come, a touch of green on that patch of
waving hemp!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Beside herself with excitement._] A glimmer of white on that road!

CHANTECLER
A wash of blue on the river!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_In a great cry._] The Sun! Look, the Sun!

CHANTECLER
There he is, I can see him, but we must hale him from that grove! [_And
both of them, moving backward together, appear to be drawing something
after them._ CHANTECLER _prolonging his crow as if to drag up the_ SUN
_by it._] Cooooooo--

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Shouting above_ CHANTECLER'S _crow._] There he comes--

CHANTECLER
--oock-a--

THE PHEASANT-HEN
--climbing--

CHANTECLER
--doodle--

THE PHEASANT-HEN
--above--

CHANTECLER
--doooooo!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
--the poplars!

CHANTECLER
[_In a last, dry-throated, desperate crow._] Cock-a-doodle-doo [_Both
stagger, suddenly flooded with light._] It is done! [_He adds, in a tone
of satisfaction._] A proper Sun,--a giant! [_He totters toward a mossy
rise and drops against it._]

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Running to him, while all grows brighter and brighter._] One song now
to greet the beautiful rising Sun!

CHANTECLER
[_Very low._] I have no voice left. I spent it all. [_Hearing the other_
COCKS _crowing in the valley, he adds gently._] It matters not. He has
the songs and praises of the others.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Surprised._] What? After he appears, he hears no more from you?

CHANTECLER
No more.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Indignant._] But in that case, perhaps the Sun believes the other
Cocks have made him rise?

CHANTECLER
It matters not.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
But--

CHANTECLER
Hush! Come to my heart and let me thank you. Never has there been a
lovelier dawn.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
But what will repay you for all your pains?

CHANTECLER
Echoes of awakening life down in the valley! [_Confused living noises
are beginning to mount from below._] Tell me of them. I have not the
strength to listen for myself.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Runs to the top of the rise, and listens._] I hear a finger knocking
against the rim of a brazen sky--

CHANTECLER
[_With closed eyes._] The Angelus.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Other strokes, which sound like a human Angelus after the divine--

CHANTECLER
The forge-hammer.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Lowing,--then a song--

CHANTECLER
The plow.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Continuing to listen._] Sounds as of a bird's nest fallen into the
little street--

CHANTECLER
[_With growing emotion._] The school!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Imps of whom I catch no glimpse buffet one another in the water--

CHANTECLER
Women washing linen.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
And suddenly, on all sides, what are they--iron locusts rubbing their
wings together?

CHANTECLER
[_Half rising, in the fullness of pride._] Ah, if scythes are whetting,
the reapers will soon be harvesting the golden grain! [_The sounds
increase and mingle: bells, hammers, washer-women's wooden spades,
laughter, singing, grinding of steel, cracking of whips._] All at work!
And I have done that!--Oh, impossible!--Pheasant-hen, help me! This is
the dreadful moment! [_He looks wildly about him._] I made the sunrise!
I did! Wherefore And how? And where? No sooner does my reason
return--than I go mad! For I who believe I have power to rekindle the
celestial gold--I--well--oh, it is dreadful--

THE PHEASANT-HEN
What is?

CHANTECLER
I am humble-minded, modest! You will never tell?

THE PHEASANT-HEN
No, no!

CHANTECLER
You promise? Ah! let my enemies never know!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Moved._] Chantecler!

CHANTECLER
I feel myself unworthy of my glory. Why was I chosen, even I, to drive
out black night? No sooner have I brought the heavens to a white glow,
than the pride which lifted me aloft drops dead. I fall to earth. What,
I, so small, I made the immeasurable dawn? And having done this, I must
do it again? Nay, but I cannot! Nay, it would be vain! Never need I
attempt it! Despair overtakes me--Comfort me, love!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Tenderly._] My own!

CHANTECLER
Such a burden of responsibility resting upon me! That inspiring breath
which I await when I scratch in the sand, will it come again? I feel the
whole future depending upon an incomprehensible something which might
perchance fail me! Do you understand now the anguish gnawing me? Ah, the
swan is certain, by bending his neck, to find under water the grasses he
delights in; the eagle, when he swoops from the blue, sure of falling
upon his prey; and you are ever sure of finding in the earth the well
supplied nests of the ants,--but I, for whom my own work remains a
mystery, I, possessed ever by the fear of the morrow, am I sure of
finding my song in my heart?

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Clasping him with her wings._] Surely, you will find it, surely!

CHANTECLER
Yes, talk to me like that. I listen, I heed you. You must believe me
when I believe, and not when I doubt. Tell me again--

THE PHEASANT-HEN
You are beautiful!

CHANTECLER
About that I care very little.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
And you sang beautifully!

CHANTECLER
Say that I sang badly, but tell me that it is I who make--

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Indeed, indeed, I admire you beyond all bounds and measure!

CHANTECLER
No,--tell me that what I told you is true--

THE PHEASANT-HEN
What?

CHANTECLER
That it is I who make--

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Yes, my glorious Beloved, yes, it is you who make the dawn appear!

THE BLACKBIRD
[_Suddenly appearing._] Well, well, old man!



SCENE FOURTH

THE SAME, THE BLACKBIRD


CHANTECLER
The Blackbird!--My secret!

THE BLACKBIRD
[_Bowing with every sign of admiration._] Allow me to--

CHANTECLER
That inveterate mocker! [_To the_ PHEASANT-HEN.] Leave us not alone! My
soul is still open--his mockery would enter in!

THE BLACKBIRD
Ripping!

CHANTECLER
Where have you come from?

THE BLACKBIRD
[_Indicating an empty overturned flower-pot._] From that flower-pot.

CHANTECLER
But how--?

THE BLACKBIRD
I was having my early snack cozily in the earthenware retreat you see,
when suddenly--oh, allow me to express at once the amazement, the
admiration--

CHANTECLER
Eavesdropping inside a pot! How can you stoop to--

THE BLACKBIRD
Hang the pot! I've had a sensation! I tell you I was wild! My feet were
doing such a horn-pipe I had trouble to keep my eye steady at the
peep-hole.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
You could see us?

THE BLACKBIRD
[_Showing the hole at the bottom of the flower-pot._] Could I see you!
Yonder stump of red cone has exactly the black hole to let through my
yellow bill. Apologies,--but it was too tempting! A bird of taste, I am.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
For the sake of this sincere tribute, I forgive you all the rest!

CHANTECLER
But--

THE BLACKBIRD
[_Coming and going in excitement._] Oh, wonderful, and again wonderful,
and then again wonderful!--Hear me rant!

CHANTECLER
[_Amazed._] What, is it possible that you--?

THE BLACKBIRD
Am I given to gush? This time, old man, it's the genuine article,
Enthusiasm with a capital E!

CHANTECLER
Are you in earnest?

THE BLACKBIRD
Must I send you a blankety carrier-pigeon with the news?--That Cock and
that crow,--oh, my soul!--And then the day breaking,--oh, my stars!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_To_ CHANTECLER.] There seems to be no reason, dear, why I should not
leave you alone together.

CHANTECLER
But where are you going?

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Slightly ashamed of her own frivolity._] I am going to the--

THE BLACKBIRD
The Guinea-hen's Day he's just given the finishing touches to!

CHANTECLER
[_To the_ PHEASANT-HEN.] Must I go too?

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Tenderly._] No, after rising to such heights, I think you may be
excused from the Guinea-hen's at home!

CHANTECLER
[_With a touch of sadness._] You, however, are going?

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Gaily._] I want to show off your sunshine on my dress! I will be back
directly. Wait for me here.

THE BLACKBIRD
Yes, much better keep out of the way.

CHANTECLER
[_Looking at him._] Wherefore?

THE BLACKBIRD
[_Quickly._] Nothing! [_Falling into fresh ecstasies._] Oh, this blessed
Cock of ours!

CHANTECLER
[_To the_ PHEASANT-HEN.] You will not be long?

THE PHEASANT-HEN
The merest moment. [_Low to him before leaving._] You see, even the
Blackbird is impressed! [_She flies off._]



SCENE FIFTH

CHANTECLER, THE BLACKBIRD


CHANTECLER
[_Coming back to the_ BLACKBIRD.] And so that habitual skeptical
sneer--?

THE BLACKBIRD
Wiped out! My satirical whistling, as the Dog called it, now expresses
pure admiration. Listen, like this: [_He whistles admiringly._]
Tew!--How is that?--Tew-tew [_Nodding soberly._] That's all right!

CHANTECLER
[_Innocently._] You are not such a bad fellow, after all. I said so to
the Dog.

THE BLACKBIRD
[_With profound conviction._] You're a wonderful old boy!

CHANTECLER
[_Modestly._] Oh!

THE BLACKBIRD
To come it over the Hens--[_He again whistles Admiringly._] make them
believe that he engineers the dawn! [CHANTECLER _starts._] A simple
idea, but it took you to get on to it! Brother, I believe you were
hatched in Columbus' egg!

CHANTECLER
But--

THE BLACKBIRD
All other Don Juans are donkeys beside you! Says he to himself: Make the
daybreak to impress little pheasant-hens! And does it, too--succeeds!

CHANTECLER
[_In a smothered voice._] Be still!

THE BLACKBIRD
Neat, the little roof which must be gilded! Complete, the ladder for the
Motes!

CHANTECLER
[_In a spasm of pain._] Be still!

THE BLACKBIRD
And the access of modesty, a sweet little final touch! I kiss my hand to
you! Oh, he knows how--no mistake he knows--

CHANTECLER
[_Constraining himself, in a curt voice._] The Dawn? Certainly, I know
her. I think I may claim that honor!

THE BLACKBIRD
You precious fakir! Don't you consider you have succeeded?

CHANTECLER
In bringing on the day? Yes, certainly, I have succeeded admirably, in
this case.

THE BLACKBIRD
Oh, you do it so well! How awfully well he does it!

CHANTECLER
Making the light? Of course, I have done it so often! I am used to it.
The Sun obeys me.

THE BLACKBIRD
So, worthy Joshua! You feel the dawn coming, and then you crow! For
lightness of touch and richness of invention, give us a lyric poet!

CHANTECLER
[_Bursting forth._] Wretch!

THE BLACKBIRD
[_Surprised._] Are you keeping it up with me? [_Winking._] Oh, we know
how the thing is done!

CHANTECLER
You may know,--not I! I just open my heart and sing!

THE BLACKBIRD
[_Hopping about._] That's the idea!

CHANTECLER
Blackbird, laugh at everything besides, but not at that, if you love me!

THE BLACKBIRD
I love you!

CHANTECLER
[_Bitterly._] With half a heart!

THE BLACKBIRD
Can't say a word about his _Fiat Lux?_

CHANTECLER
Not that! Not that!

THE BLACKBIRD
Old man, it's not my fault that I'm no gull.

CHANTECLER
[_Looking after him as he hops about._] He cannot keep still long
enough, I suppose, to let the sacred truth sink in. [_Trying to stop him
in his hopping._] You behold the agony of emotion shaking me. No more
baffle and keep me off with words!

THE BLACKBIRD
[_Hopping past him._] Catch, if you can, and convince me!

CHANTECLER
[_Imploring._] It's a matter of life--my profoundest life! Oh, convince
you I must, if only for a second! I feel the holy impulse to struggle
with your soul!

THE BLACKBIRD
[_Hopping past him._] Do you!

CHANTECLER
In solemn earnest, at the bottom of your heart, you did--did you
not?--believe me?

THE BLACKBIRD
I believe you!

CHANTECLER
[_With pressing anguish._] You must in some manner be aware of the
dreadful cost to me of that song? Come, use your reason. To sing as you
heard me sing, you must realise that I needed--

THE BLACKBIRD
A whopping muscle and a tolerable nerve!

CHANTECLER
No, let us not make light of serious things, responsible winged
creatures that we are!

THE BLACKBIRD
Let us go in for heavy-weight truths, by all means!

CHANTECLER
But can't you see that to look straight at the sun, rising before his
eyes by the exertions of his larynx, one must have at the same time--

THE BLACKBIRD
Stentorian lungs and the eyes of a lynx! [_He hops out of the way._]

CHANTECLER
[_Controlling himself._] No, I cannot give up the hope of winning this
soul to the truth! [_With desperate patience._] Come, now, have you any
conception, unhappy bird, of what dawn actually is?

THE BLACKBIRD
I should say so! It's the time of day when fluffy Aurora gets busy, as
it were, and plays ball!

CHANTECLER
But what do you say when you see the dawn shining upon the mountains?

THE BLACKBIRD
Mountains, I say, what on earth are you blushing about?

CHANTECLER
And what do you say when you hear me singing in the furrow long before
the cricket is awake?

THE BLACKBIRD
Cricket, I say, you scandalous slug-a-bed! [_He hops out of the way._]

CHANTECLER
[_Beside himself._] Are you conscious of no impulse to exclaim, cry out,
when I have made a dawn so fine and fiery-red that the heron, flying in
the early glow, looks from afar like a flamingo?

THE BLACKBIRD
Sure, brother, sure! I feel like shouting, "Bully, do it again!" [_He
hops out of the way._]

CHANTECLER
[_Exhausted._] That soul! I am more spent with chasing it than with a
whole day's grasshopper hunting! [_Violently._] Did you not see the sky?

THE BLACKBIRD
[_Simply._] How could I? The ground is all you can see through that
little black hole. [_Pointing at the flower-pot._]

CHANTECLER
Did you see the mountain-tops tremble and turn crimson?

THE BLACKBIRD
While you were crowing, I had my eye on your feet.

CHANTECLER
[_Sorrowfully._] Ah!

THE BLACKBIRD
They were performing on the soft sod something choice in the line of
fancy dances!

CHANTECLER
[_Giving up._] I pity you! Back to your darkness, obscure Blackbird!

THE BLACKBIRD
Your obedient servant, illustrious Cock!

CHANTECLER
My course is toward the sun!

THE BLACKBIRD
Take along smoked glasses!

CHANTECLER
Blackbird, do you know the one thing upon earth worthy that one should
live wholly for its sake?

THE BLACKBIRD
There I draw the line. I won't enter the debate!

CHANTECLER
That thing is effort, Blackbird--effort, which uplifts and ennobles the
lowest! For which reason, you, contemner of every sublime aspiration, I
contemn! And that fragile roseate snail, struggling unaided to silver
over a whole fagot, I honour!

THE BLACKBIRD
[_Snapping up the snail._] I'll make him look silly!

CHANTECLER
[_With a cry of horror._] Abominable! To point a joke--put out a little
flame! An end. Here we part. You have no more heart than soul.
[_Going._]

THE BLACKBIRD
[_Hopping up on the fagot._] I have mind, however!

CHANTECLER
[_Turning, disdainfully._] That is open to discussion.

THE BLACKBIRD
[_Acidly._] Oh, very well! I was administering, in my merry little
characteristic way, a grain of antidote against lunacy. But I wash my
claws of you. Go ahead, justify the report of your enemies.

CHANTECLER
[_Returning._] Who? What?

THE BLACKBIRD
Strut about with your bill-board: "I'm the whole show!"

CHANTECLER
You associate with those who hate me?

THE BLACKBIRD
Do you object?

CHANTECLER
No, you pitiful jester! The habit has grown so strong, you can no more
be in earnest about friendship now than anything else. [_Going nearer to
him._] Who are my enemies?

THE BLACKBIRD
The Owls.

CHANTECLER
You sorry fool! Can't you see that to believe in my destiny becomes all
too easy if the Owls are against me?

THE BLACKBIRD
Rest happy, then. They have a deal on--your lighting of the world being
a trifle flashy for their taste--a deal on for cutting your throat.

CHANTECLER
Through whom?

THE BLACKBIRD
A brother bird.

CHANTECLER
A Cock?

THE BLACKBIRD
A Saint George of a Cock, who is to meet you--

CHANTECLER
Where?

THE BLACKBIRD
At the Guinea-hen's.

CHANTECLER
What a farce!

THE BLACKBIRD
Wait! It's one of those Cocks bred and trained for fighting, who would
make just two bites of either you or me. [_As_ CHANTECLER _abruptly
starts toward the back._] Where are you going?

CHANTECLER
To the Guinea-hen's.

THE BLACKBIRD
Ha! I forgot our knightly spurs and helmet! [_He makes a feint of
preventing him._] Take my advice, don't go!

CHANTECLER
But I will go!

THE BLACKBIRD
Hold on!

CHANTECLER
[_Stopping beside the flower-pot, as if amazed._] How singular!

THE BLACKBIRD
What?

CHANTECLER
Did I understand you to say you came out of that flower-pot?

THE BLACKBIRD
You did.

CHANTECLER
[_Incredulous._] But how could you possibly have got into it?

THE BLACKBIRD
[_Getting into the pot._] I told you, and tell you again! Through that
little black hole I was looking at the--[_He thrusts his bill through
the hole at the bottom._]

CHANTECLER
The earth! And now through a little blue hole you shall look at the sky!
[_With a vigorous blow of his wing he turns the pot over the_ BLACKBIRD,
_who is heard fluttering beneath it, with smothered cries._] For you
hate and shun the blue sky, you Dwellers in Pots! But one can force you
to see at least as much as would cover a corn-flower, by overturning
your pot, now and then--with the sweep of a wing! [_Off._]

CURTAIN



ACT THIRD


THE GUINEA-HEN'S DAY

_Corner of a kitchen-garden, enclosed on the sides by hedges. At the
back, espaliers. Vegetables and flowers of all kinds. Cold frames. Among
the fruit trees, an upright pole, rigged in an old frock-coat, pair of
trousers, and opera hat, fills the function of scarecrow._


SCENE FIRST

_The_ GUINEA-HEN, HENS, DUCKS, _etc.; the_ PHEASANT-HEN, _the_
BLACKBIRD, _later_ PATOU.

_At the rise of the curtain, multitudinous clatter and confused swarming
of_ HENS _and_ CHICKENS.


THE GUINEA-HEN
[_Going impetuously from one to the other._] How do you do? How do you
do?--There is scarcely room to move! My guests reach all the way to the
cucumber patch!

CHORUS
[_Up in the air._]
  _Busily buzzing_--

THE GUINEA-HEN
A regular crush!

A HEN
[_Gazing at a row of huge pumpkins._] What attractive objects!

THE GUINEA-HEN
Art pottery! Rather good of its kind, if I do say so!

A CHICK
[_Listening with his bill in the air._] Singers?

THE GUINEA-HEN
Yes,--

CHORUS
  _Busily buzzing_--

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_In her sprightliest manner._] The Wasps! [_To a_ CHICKEN.] How do you
do? [_She flits from one guest to the other._]

THE WASPS
  _Busily buzzing
  Estival glees.
  Fill we with murmurs
  The mulberry trees_!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Passing with the_ BLACKBIRD _and laughing._] So you were caught?

THE BLACKBIRD
[_Finishing his story._] Exactly as if a hat had been plumped down over
me. But I managed by beating my wings to throw off the beastly pot.
[_Looking around him._] Chantecler has not come yet?

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Surprised._] Is he coming?

PATOU
[_Suddenly appearing on the wheelbarrow, from whence he can watch the
scene as from a pulpit._] I still hope he may change his mind.

THE BLACKBIRD
Patou there, in the wheelbarrow?

PATOU
[_Shaking his surly head, and a bit of broken chain hanging from his
collar._] Chantecler told me everything Blackbird, as he went by. In a
towering rage I broke my chain, and am here to keep an eye on the wicked
lot of you.

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_To the_ BLACKBIRD.] Has he invited himself to my party, that
moth-eaten old thing?

CHORUS
[_Among the trees._]
  _Our praises, Sun, our praises!_

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Looking upward._] Music?

THE GUINEA-HEN
The Cicadas!

CHORUS OF CICADAS
  _We simmer in thy gaze,
  We bask beneath thy blaze,
  Receive our grateful praise!_

THE YOUNG GUINEA-COCK
[_Low and quickly to his mother._] Tsicadas, mother. You must pronounce
it Tsi!

A MAGPIE
[_In black coat and white tie, announcing the guests as they arrive
through a hole such as Chickens dig at the foot of hedges._] The Gander!

THE GANDER
[_Entering, jocularly._] What's all this fuss and feathers my lady? Our
names called as we enter?

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_Demurely._] Yes, you see, expecting some rather great people, I
thought it well to stand an usher at the blackthorn door.

THE MAGPIE
[_Announcing._] The Duck!

THE DUCK
[_Entering, impressed by the elegance of the occasion._] Here is style
and grandeur indeed! Our names called!

THE GUINEA-HEN
Yes, you see, expecting some rather great people--

THE MAGPIE
The Turkey-hen!

THE TURKEY-HEN
[_Entering, after a supercilious glance._] This is quite more of an
affair, my dear, than I was anticipating.--Names called!

THE GUINEA-HEN
Yes, I had in the Magpie to supplement my usual staff.

CHORUS
[_Among blossoming branches._]
  _Boom! Boom!
  From bloom to bloom_!

THE TURKEY-HEN
[_Lifting her bill._] A Chorus?

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_Breezily._] The Bees!

CHORUS
  _Make distant flowers
  Bride and groom!_

THE TURKEY-HEN
Wonders on every side!

THE GUINEA-HEN
The Bees here, the Tsicadas yonder--[_To a passing_ HEN.] How do you do?
How do you do?

BEES
[_At the right._]
  _Boom!_

CICADAS
[_At the left._]
  _Our praises!_

BEES
  _Boom!_

CICADAS
  _Our praises!_

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_To the_ PHEASANT-HEN.] My garden produces the most remarkable of
everything!

THE YOUNG GUINEA-COCK
The brightest flowers!

THE GUINEA-HEN
The big potatoes!

THE BLACKBIRD
And peaches! Perfect peaches!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Inconvenienced by the movement and the crowd, to the_ BLACKBIRD.] Let
us stand out of the crowd a moment, behind this watering-pot.

THE BLACKBIRD
The watering-pot, alias the Intermittent Baldpate, so called because
there flows from his copper scalp when he is tilted a marvelous growth
of silver hair.

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_Spying the_ CAT, _who, outstretched along an apple-bough is watching
with half-closed eyes._] I have among my guests the Cat.

THE BLACKBIRD
Tomkyns de Tomkyns! [_A_ BIRD _is heard warbling in a tree._]

THE GUINEA-HEN
I have the Chaffinch!

THE BLACKBIRD
Let him chaff inchworms, what care we?

THE GUINEA-HEN
The Darning-needle!

THE BLACKBIRD
She shall mend up Ragged Robin, now's his chance!

PATOU
[_More and more disgusted._] All that is supposed to be funny!

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_Pecking a cabbage leaf from which roll drops of dew._] I have the Dew!

PATOU
[_Grimly._] Your witticism for her?

THE BLACKBIRD
[_Brightly._] Fresh-water pearls!

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_Pointing out several_ CHICKS _walking among the crowd._] Have you seen
them? I have several of the A.I.'s Chicks!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
A.I.?

THE GUINEA-HEN
The Acme Incubator.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Oh, have you?

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_Presenting the_ CHICKS.] All from the topmost compartment!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Indeed?

ONE OF THE CHICKS
[_Nudging his neighbour._] She is dumbfounded!

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_Contemptuously._] Eggs hatched by the old vulgar method, fie!

THE BLACKBIRD,
Good Lord, exempt us!

THE MAGPIE
[_Announcing._] The Guinea-pig!

THE GUINEA-HEN
It's the famous one, you know! The Guinea-pig who was inoculated--surely
you remember the case--very well, that's the one! There you see him. I
made a point of getting him to come. Everybody is here! I have
everybody! I have--[_To the_ GUINEA-PIG.] How do you do? [_To the_
PHEASANT-HEN.] I have our great philosopher Tur-Key--Yes, it should be
written with a hyphen--who will give us a little talk among the currant
bushes under the tea-roses--[_To a passing_ HEN.] How do you do? [_To
the_ PHEASANT-HEN.] Educational Tea or Currant Topics! [_Whirling from
one to the other._] Everyone is here, everyone of the slightest mark or
consequence! The Pheasant-hen is here, in a frock from fairyland. The
Duck is here, who is so good as to say he will recite for us by and by.
The Tortoise is here--[_Noticing that the_ TORTOISE _is not there_] I
was mistaken, the Tortoise is not here. She is late.

THE BLACKBIRD
[_Affecting deep concern._] What is the little talk she seems so
regrettably likely to miss?

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_Suddenly serious._] The Moral Problem.

THE BLACKBIRD
What a pity!

[_The_ GUINEA-HEN _goes to the back, scattering greetings, in ecstasies
of sociability._]

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_To the_ BLACKBIRD.] Who is the Tortoise?

THE BLACKBIRD
A hard old character, impervious, I fear, to moral problems, who goes in
for walking matches in a loud check suit!

[_Murmur among the hollyhocks._]

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Listen, a Drone!

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_Briskly returning._] The Drone is here! In the bright light overhead,
what a stylish figure of a fly!

THE BLACKBIRD
No "at home" complete without it! Ladies cry for it! Won't be happy
until--

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_Jumping up in the air toward the_ DRONE.] How do you do? How do you
do? [_She follows his flight with excited leaps and hops._]

THE BLACKBIRD
[_Touching his brow with his wing._] She is dotty!

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_At the back, with shrill_ GUINEA-HEN _cries._] It's my last day! How
do you do? My last day until August! Mondays in August, don't forget!

A HEN
[_Seeing cherries dropping around her._] Oh, cherries, look!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Looking upward._] It is the Breeze!

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_Fluttering forward again, excited as ever._] I have the Breeze, who
now and then shakes down a cherry! I never ask her. She comes unasked.
What's-his-name is here! And What's-her-name is here, and--[_To the back
tumultuously._]

THE BLACKBIRD
And Thingumbob, and Stick-in-the-mud! [_He has arrived without
appearance of design beneath the tree where the_ CAT _is lying, and asks
rapidly, under breath._] Cat, what about the conspiracy?

THE CAT
[_Who from his tree can see beyond the hedge._] It is afoot. I see the
interminable file of phenomenal Cocks approaching, headed by the Peacock
who comes to present them.

A CRY
[_Outside._] Ee--yong! [_The_ CROWD _throngs toward the entrance._]

PATOU
[_Grumbling._] That abominable concertina cry--

THE MAGPIE
The Peacock!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_To the_ BLACKBIRD.] Have you a fancy name for him?

THE BLACKBIRD
[_Imitating the_ PEACOCK'S _cry._] Our great Accordee-yong!



SCENE SECOND

THE SAME, THE PEACOCK.

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_To the_ PEACOCK, _who enters slowly, with his head borne very stiff
and high._] Master, dear Master, would you be so extremely condescending
as to come and stand with your back to these sunflowers? Peacock!
Sunflowers! A study for Burne-Jones!

ALL
[_Crowding around the_ PEACOCK.] Master! Master!

A CHICKEN
[_Low to the_ DUCK.] A word from him can make one's fortune in society!

ANOTHER CHICKEN
[_Who has succeeded in forcing his way to the_ PEACOCK, _stammering with
emotion._] Master, what do you think of my latest "cheep"? [_Suspense.
Religious silence._]

THE PEACOCK
[_Solemnly, letting the word drop slowly from his beak._] Definitive.
[_Sensation._]

A DUCK
[_Trembling._] And my "quack"? [_Suspense._]

THE PEACOCK
Ultimate! [_Sensation._]

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_Delighted, to the_ HENS.] I may say that it is at my days most
especially he throws off these specimens of a verbal art which might
fairly be called--

THE PEACOCK
Lapidary.

ALL THE HENS
[_Rolling up their eyes._] Wonderful!

A HEN
[_Coming forward, faint with emotion._] Master, high priest of taste,
what do you think of my dress? [_Suspense._]

THE PEACOCK
[_After a glance._] Affirmative. [_Sensation._]

THE TUFTED HEN
[_Same business._] And my bonnet? [_Suspense._]

THE PEACOCK
Absolute. [_Sensation._]

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_In a burst of emotion._] Our bonnets are absolute!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Affecting exclusive interest in the_ BEES.] Ah, there is the Choir
Invisible striking up again!

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_Presenting the young_ GUINEA-COCK _to the_ PEACOCK.] My son!--What do
you think of him?

THE PEACOCK
Plausible.

CHORUS OF WASPS
  _Busily buzzing_--

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_Overjoyed, running to the_ PHEASANT-HEN.] Oh, he said he was plausible!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Who was?

THE GUINEA-HEN
My son!

CHORUS OF BEES

  _When July
    Too holly glows
  Seek the shade
    Inside the rose_!

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_Returning to the_ PEACOCK.] Does not the rhythm of that chorus impress
you as--

THE PEACOCK
Asunartetos!

A HEN
[_To the_ GUINEA-HEN.] Your guest, my dear, can fit an epithet!

THE GUINEA-HEN
Pontiff of the Unexpected Adjective I call him!

THE PEACOCK
[_Distilling his words, in a discordant haughty voice._] True it is that--

THE GUINEA-HEN
Ah, this is most pleasant, most pleasant! He is going to talk to us.

THE PEACOCK
--a Ruskin rather more refined, I hope, than the earlier one, with a
tact--

THE GUINEA-HEN
Very true!

PEACOCK
--a tact for which I stand largely in my own debt, I have constituted
myself Petronius-Priest and Maecenas-Messiah volatile volatiliser of
words, and that, jeweled judge, I love by my cameos and filigrees of
speech to represent the Taste of which I am the--

PATOU
Oh, my poor head!

THE PEACOCK
[_Nonchalantly._]--shall I say guardian?

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_Effervescently._] Do say guardian!

THE PEACOCK
No. Thesmothetes. [_Respectful murmur of delight._]

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_To the_ PHEASANT-HEN.] Now you have seen our Peacock! Aren't you
excited?

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Slightly bored._] Yes,--because I know the Cock is coming.

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_Delighted._] To-day? He is coming to-day? [_She announces to the
general company, enthusiastically._] Chantecler!

THE PEACOCK
[_Slightly miffed._] A far greater triumph lies in store for you, fair
friend.

THE GUINEA-HEN
Triumph? [_The_ PEACOCK _nods mysteriously._] What triumph?

THE PEACOCK
[_Walking away from her._] You shall see.

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_Following him._] Of what triumph are you speaking?

THE PEACOCK
I said, "You shall see!"

MAGPIE
[_Announcing._] Cock Braekel of Campine!



SCENE THIRD

THE SAME, _then gradually the_ COCKS.


THE GUINEA-HEN
[_Stopping short, amazed._] Braekel? At my party? There's some mistake.

THE BRAEKEL COCK
[_Bowing before her._] Madam--

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_Breathless with emotion in the presence of this white_ COCK _braided
with black._] This unexpected pleasure--

THE MAGPIE
[_Announcing._] Cock Ramelslohe--

THE GUINEA-HEN
Heavens!

THE MAGPIE
[_Finishing._]--of the Slate-blue Claw!

THE PEACOCK
[_In the_ GUINEA-HEN'S _ear, while the startling_ RAMELSLOHE _bows._] He
is one of the most recent leucotites!

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_Blankly._] A leucotite--How interesting!

THE MAGPIE
[_Announcing in a louder and louder, more and more impressive voice._]
Cock Wyandotte of the Sable Spur! [_Shiver of emotion among the_ HENS.]

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_Off her head with excitement._] Heavens and gracious powers--my son!

THE YOUNG GUINEA-COCK
[_Running to her._] Mamma!

THE GUINEA-HEN
Wyandotte! Cock Wyandotte!

THE PEACOCK
[_With a fine carelessness._] Cock with strawberry coronet, product of
Art Nouveau!

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_To the newcomers who are surrounded by astonished murmurs._]
Strawberry coronet!--Gentlemen--

THE YOUNG GUINEA-COCK
[_Who has gone to take a look outside._] Mamma!

THE GUINEA-HEN
--so kindly condescending to honour my poor house--

THE YOUNG GUINEA-COCK
Mamma, there are still others coming!

THE MAGPIE
His lordship, the Cock--

THE GUINEA-HEN
Heavens, what Cock?

THE MAGPIE
Cock of Mesopotamia with the Double Comb!

THE GUINEA-HEN
Double! Oh! [_Dashing to welcome the newcomer._] Charmed, charmed indeed!

THE PEACOCK
Out upon the obsolete! I wished to show you a few young gentlemen
slightly superlative and veritably precious.

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_Returning to the_ PEACOCK.] How shall I thank you, Peacock, dear
friend? [_To the_ PHEASANT-HEN, _patronizingly._] You will excuse me, I
know, you charming little thing. You must understand, my dear, that his
lordship the Cock of Mesopotamia has just arrived! [_Running to the_
COCK, _who bows his two combs._] A proud day for us! Charmed, delighted,
enchanted!

MAGPIE
Cock d'Orpington of the Feather-ringed Eye!

THE GUINEA-HEN
Feather-ringed--Oh!

THE BLACKBIRD
The plot thickens!

THE MAGPIE
[_While the_ GUINEA-HEN _is flying toward the_ ORPINGTON COCK.] Bearded
Cock of Varna!

THE PEACOCK
[_To the_ GUINEA-HEN.] A typical Slav!

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_Leaving the_ ORPINGTON _for the_ BEARDED COCK.] Oh, the Slav soul we
have heard so much about! Charmed, beyond words, charmed!

THE MAGPIE
Rose-footed Scotch Grey Cock!

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_Leaving the_ BEARDED COCK _for the_ SCOTCH GREY.] Oh, that rose foot!
I do admire that rose foot! Think of introducing that rose foot at my
tea! [_With conviction._] What a social event!

THE MAGPIE
Cock--

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_Out of her senses._] No, I say, no! There can't be any more!

THE MAGPIE
Cock with Goblet-shaped comb!

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_Who at every name rushes excitedly toward the newcomer._] Charmed, I
am sure! Oh, what a novel notion! Goblet-shaped!

THE MAGPIE
Blue Cock of Andalusia!

THE GUINEA-HEN
Your egg, I presume, was laid in the vibrating hollow of a guitar!
Delighted and honored,--both!

THE MAGPIE
Cock Langsham!

THE PEACOCK
A Tartar!

ALL THE HENS
[_Smitten with amazement at sight of the black giant._] A Tartar!

THE MAGPIE
Gold-penciled Hamburg Cock!

ALL THE HENS
[_At sight of the gold-laced_ COCK _in the cocked hat._] Gold-penciled
Hamburg!

THE GUINEA-HEN
My kitchen-garden party will be famous! [_To the_ HAMBURG COCK, _whose
breast is striped with black and yellow._] Oh, what a wonderful
waistcoat! May I ask what it is made of?

THE BLACKBIRD
Of zebra!

THE GUINEA-HEN
Zebra, you don't say so! It will be the pride of my life, of my whole--

THE MAGPIE
Cock--

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_Jumping._] No, I can't believe it!

THE MAGPIE
--of Burma!

THE GUINEA-HEN
Burma! [_Increasing general agitation._]

THE PEACOCK
An East Indian.

THE GUINEA-HEN
Oh, I can see his Hindu soul right in his eyes, the Hindu soul we hear
so much about! [_Running to the newcomer, in an adoring voice._]
Charmed, charmed! The Hindu soul--oh!

THE MAGPIE
Padua Cocks--The Dutch Padua of Poland!

THE GUINEA-HEN
Dutch of Poland! This is really more than I ever aspired to!

[_The_ PADUA COCKS _enter, shaking their plumes._]

THE MAGPIE
The Gold Cock! The Silver Cock!

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_In ecstasies of admiration before the flowing plume of the latter._]
With a waterfall on his head!

THE BLACKBIRD
And a suspension bridge!

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_No longer conscious of what she is saying._] And a suspension bridge!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_To_ PATOU.] Poor Guinea-hen, she will say anything after anybody!

THE MAGPIE
[_Announcing in a louder and louder tone ever more extraordinary_
COCKS.] Bagdad Cock!

THE PEACOCK
[_Dominating the tumult._] Consummately Arabian Nights.

THE GUINEA-HEN
Did you hear? Consummately Arabian Nights!

ALL THE HENS
To be sure! Awfully Arabian Nights!

THE PEACOCK
Kamaralzaman himself is hardly more so.

THE MAGPIE
Bantam Cock with ruffles!

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_Transported._] How eighteenth century this is! Look, oh, look! A
dwarf! A dwarf! Dwarfs! Little cunning bits of dwarfs!

THE YOUNG GUINEA-COCK
[_Low._] Mamma, do control yourself!

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_Screaming in the midst of the_ COCKS.] No, no, I can't and won't! That
is Kamaralzaman! I don't really know which I prefer, which I--

THE MAGPIE
Guelder Cock!

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_Rushing to the newcomer._] This is truly a treat! Another Belgian!

THE MAGPIE
Serpent-necked Cock!

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_Rattled._] To you, dear Seacock, I owe this Perpentneck!

THE MAGPIE
Duck-sided Cock! Crow-billed Cock! Hawk-footed Cock!

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_Who has fallen upon the new arrivals, bursts into shrill volubility
before the last of them._] This surpasses all! An albino! Charmed, my
dear sir, honoured, enchanted! Oh, on his head he wears a cheese!

A HEN
So he does, a cheese!--A cream cheese, to be sure! A cream cheese!

ALL THE HENS
A cream cheese!

THE MAGPIE
Crève Coeur Cock!

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_Rushing to meet him._] Oh, he has horns on his head!

THE PEACOCK
Satanic.

THE MAGPIE
Ptarmigan Cock!

THE PEACOCK
Aesthetic.

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_Rushing up to him._] Oh, he wears on his head an Assyrian helmet!

THE MAGPIE
White Pile--

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_Rushing up to him._] He wears on his head--[_Stopping short at sight
of his docked comb._] Nothing whatever. He wears nothing whatever on his
head. How odd it looks!

THE CAT
[_From his apple tree, to the_ BLACKBIRD, _indicating the_ WHITE PILE
GAME-COCK.] There is the champion. The dust conceals a razor on his lean
foot. [_The_ GAME-COCK _disappears among the throng of fancy_ COCKS,
_who are surrounded by a swarm of cackling_ HENS.]

THE MAGPIE
Negro Cock!

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_Gone quite mad among the multitude of_ COCKS _now filling the
kitchen-garden with their extraordinary head-gear aigrettes, and plumes
and helmets, double and triple combs._] Charmed, honoured,
enchanted--enchanted, honoured, charmed!

PATOU
She has taken leave of her wits!

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_To the empty air._] Charmed, charmed, enchanted, en--

THE MAGPIE
Cock with Supernumerary Toe!--Naked-necked Cock!

THE GUINEA-HEN
Naked?

THE MAGPIE
Necked!

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_To a_ HEN.] My dear, now we shall see something worth while!

THE MAGPIE
Japanese Cocks--Cock Splendens!

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_At sight of this_ COCK _whose tail is eight yards long._] Oh!--In a
swallow tail!

THE MAGPIE
Clump-backed--

THE BLACKBIRD
[_Perceiving that this_ COCK _is absolutely flat at the back._] In a
monkey-jacket!

THE MAGPIE
[_Finishing._]--or Tailless Cock!

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_Beside herself._] He has nothing whatever behind! This is the crowning
moment of my career! [_To the newcomer, effusively._] Charmed! No
tail! This is--

THE BLACKBIRD
I like his cheek!

THE MAGPIE
[_While more and more heterogeneous_ COCKS _appear._] Cock Walikikili,
called Choki-kukullo! Pseudo-Chinese Cuculicolor!

THE GUINEA-HEN
What a choice gathering!

THE PEACOCK
Kaleidoscopically cosmopolitan.

THE MAGPIE
Blue Java! White Java!

THE BLACKBIRD
[_Losing all shame._] Won't Java cup o' coffee?

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_Falling upon the_ JAVA COCKS.] Charmed, charmed!

THE MAGPIE
Brahma Cock! Cochin Cock!

THE PEACOCK
[_Proudly._] The great vicious Cocks, representatives of the corrupt
East, the putrescent Orient!

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_Intoxicated._] Putrescent!

THE PEACOCK
Unwholesome, morbid grace!

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_To the_ COCHIN COCK.] Charmed! Charmed!--Do notice his obscene eye!

THE MAGPIE
[_Announcing wildly, infected with the general delirium._] Chili Cock,
curled hindside fore! Antwerp Cock, curled inside out!

ALL THE HENS
[_Fighting for the newcomers._] Oh, putrescent!--Oh, hindside fore!

THE GUINEA-HEN
Inside out!

THE MAGPIE
Shankless Jumping-cock!

A HEN
[_Fainting with emotion._] I suppose he jumps with his stomach!

THE GUINEA-HEN
An India-rubber Cock!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_To_ PATOU, _who from his wheelbarrow is looking off into the
distance._] And Chantecler?

PATOU
Will be here soon.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Can you see him?

PATOU
Yes, off there, scratching up the earth. Now he is on his way.

THE MAGPIE
Ghoondook Cock with Umbrella Topknot!

CRY OF ENTHUSIASM
Oh!

THE MAGPIE
Iberian Cock with Lint Side Whiskers!

CRY OF ENTHUSIASM
Oh!

THE MAGPIE
Cock Bans Backin or Fat Cheek of Thuringia!

CRY OF ENTHUSIASM
Oh!

THE MAGPIE
Yankee Cochin of Plymouth Rock!

[_Sudden silence._ CHANTECLER _has appeared at the entrance, just behind
the_ COCK _last announced._]

CHANTECLER
[_To the_ MAGPIE.] Pray simply say, "The Cock!"



SCENE FOURTH

THE SAME, CHANTECLER, _later_ THE PIGEONS, _and_
THE SWAN.

THE MAGPIE
[_After looking_ CHANTECLER _up and down, disdainfully._] The Cock!

CHANTECLER
[_From the threshold, to the_ GUINEA-HEN.] Your pardon Madam,--my humble
duty!--for venturing to present myself in this plumage--

THE GUINEA-HEN
Come in, I pray!

CHANTECLER
I hardly know whether I should. I have a limited number of toes--

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_Indulgently._] Oh, never mind!

CHANTECLER
I cannot claim to be a Carpathian, and--I hardly know how to conceal it
from you--I have feet!

THE GUINEA-HEN
Oh, let not that distress you!

CHANTECLER
A plain red-pepper comb, an ordinary garlic clove ear--

THE GUINEA-HEN
Of course, of course, we will excuse you. You came in your business suit!

CHANTECLER
Nay, my best! Pardon if my best combines merely the green of all April
with the gold of all October! I stand abashed. I am the Cock, just the
Cock, without further addition. The Cock such as he is still found in
some old-fashioned barnyard. A Cock shaped like a Cock, whose outline
persists in the vane on the steeple-top in the artist's eye, and the
humble toy which a child's hand finds among shavings in a little
wooden box.

AN IRONICAL VOICE
[_From among the group of gorgeous prodigies._] The Gallic Cock, in short?

CHANTECLER
[_Gently, without even turning._] Sure as I am of my aboriginal claim to
this soil, I make no point of assuming the name. But, now you mention
it, I recognise that when one simply says the Cock, that is the Cock
he means!

THE BLACKBIRD
[_Low to_ CHANTECLER.] I have seen your adversary!

CHANTECLER
[_Catching sight of the_ PHEASANT-HEN _approaching._] Be still! She must
know nothing of this!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Coquettishly._] Did you come for the sake of seeing me?

CHANTECLER
[_Bowing._] I am weak, you remember!

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_Listening to the_ COCHIN-CHINA COCK, _who is talking in an undertone,
thickly surrounded by_ HENS.] That Cock from Cochin China is
simply awful!

CHANTECLER
[_Turning._] Enough!

THE HENS
[_Around the_ COCHIN COCK, _giving little scandalised cries._] Oh!--

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_Tickled._] Oh, you naughty bird!--He is quite the most improper of our
gallinacea!

CHANTECLER
[_Louder._] Enough!

THE COCHIN-CHINA COCK
[_Stops, and with mocking surprise._] Is it the Gallic Cock objecting?

CHANTECLER
I am not Gallic if you give the word a base or ridiculous meaning. By
Jove! Every Hen here knows whether my trumpet blast belongs to a
soprano! But your perverse attempts to wring blushes from little
baggages in convenient corners outrage my love of Love! It is true that
I care more to retain love's dream than these Cochin-Chinese, who,
courting a giggle, use refinement in coarseness, research in vulgarity;
true that my blood has swifter flow in a less ponderous body, and that I
am not a feathered pig,--but a Cock!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Come, come away to the woods,--I love you!

CHANTECLER
[_Looking around him._] Oh, to see a real being appear! Someone simple,
someone--

THE MAGPIE
[_Announcing._] Two Pigeons!

CHANTECLER
[_Drawing a breath of relief._] At last,--pigeons! [_He runs eagerly to
the entrance._]

THE PIGEONS
[_Entering with a series of somersaults._] Hop!

CHANTECLER
[_Falling back in amazement._] What is this?

THE PIGEONS
[_Introducing themselves between two springs._] The Tumblers! English
Clowns!

CHANTECLER
Where am I?

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_Running after the_ TUMBLERS _who disappear among the throng of
guests._] Hop! Hop!

CHANTECLER
Pigeons turning acrobats!--Oh, the joy of seeing something true,
something unblemished--

THE MAGPIE
[_Announcing._] The Swan!

CHANTECLER
[_Coming forward delighted._] Good! A Swan! [_Shrinking away._] He is
black!

THE BLACK SWAN
[_With swaggering satisfaction._] I have discarded the whiteness while
preserving the outline!

CHANTECLER
The real Swan's shadow does no less! [_Thrusting the_ SWAN _aside to hop
up on a bench whence, through a gap in the hedge, he can see the distant
meadows._] Let me climb up on this bench. I need to make sure that
Nature still exists--though so far away! Ah, yes! The grass is green, a
cow is grazing, a calf sucking--And Heaven be praised, the calf has a
single head! [_Coming down again beside the_ PHEASANT-HEN.]

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Oh, come away to the innocent woods, sincere and dewy, where we will
love each other!

THE BLACKBIRD
[_Pointing at_ CHANTECLER _and the_ PHEASANT-HEN, _who are standing
close and talking low._] We are getting on!

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_Intensely interested._] Do you think so? [_She spreads her wings to
screen them._] Oh, I am so fond of helping along a clandestine
love affair!

THE BLACKBIRD
[_Sticking his bill under the_ GUINEA-HEN'S _wing so as to keep the pair
in sight._] I believe she has thoughts of annexing his comb.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_To_ CHANTECLER.] Come, dearest, come away!

CHANTECLER
[_Resisting._] No, I must sing where Destiny placed me. I am useful
here, I am beloved--

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Remembering what she overheard the night before in the farmyard._] Are
you so sure?--Come away to the woods, where we shall hear real pigeons
cooing tenderly to each other!

THE TURKEY
[_At the back._] Ladies, the great Peacock--

THE PEACOCK
[_Modestly._] The Super-peacock--who supervenes, and supersedes--

THE GUINEA-HEN
Will spread his tail for us! He has expressed his amiable willingness so
far to favour us.

[_The company falls into groups of spectators, the outlandish_ COCKS
_forming a wreath around their patron._]

THE PEACOCK
[_Preparing to spread his tail._] I am, by precious natural gift, in
addition to my multifarious accomplishments something of a--shall I say
artist in firework?

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_Effervescently._] Yes!

THE PEACOCK
No. Pyrotechnist. For the choicest piece in urban gardens, where
Catharine-wheels on festival nights spurt sidereal spray, and rockets
shot into gold-riddled skies fall back in prismatic showers, is less
sapphirine, smaragdine, cuprine--

CHANTECLER
Zounds!

THE PEACOCK
--than, I venture to say, ladies, am I--

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Oh, I understood that last word!

THE PEACOCK
--when I unfurl the union of fan, jewel-case, and screen, upon which I
offer to the self-same sunbeams that redden the reed all the joyous gems
you now may contemplate!

CHANTECLER
What a silly bill!

[_The_ PEACOCK _has spread his tail._]

A COCK
[_To the_ PEACOCK.] Master, which of us will you make the fashion?

THE PADUA COCK
[_Quickly coming forward._] Me! I look like a palm-tree!

A CHINA COCK
[_Pushing the_ PADUA COCK _aside._] I look like a pagoda!

A BIG FEATHER-FOOTED COCK
[_Pushing the_ CHINA COCK _aside._] Me! I have cauliflowers sprouting at
my heels!

CHANTECLER
Each is in one the show and Mr. Barnum!

ALL
[_Parading and filing past the_ PEACOCK.] See my beak! See my feet! See
my feathers!

CHANTECLER
[_Suddenly shouting at them._] Lo! While you hold your costume contest,
a Scarecrow gives you his blessing!

[_Behind them, in fact, the wind has lifted the arms of the_ SCARECROW,
_which loosely wave above the pageant._]

ALL
[_Starting back._] What?

CHANTECLER
Behold this dummy talking to that lay-figure! [_While the wind blows
through the flapping rags._] What say the trousers, dancing their limp
fandango? They say, "We were once the fashion!" And, terror of the
titlark, what says the old hat which a beggar would none of? "I was the
fashion!" And the coat? "I was the fashion!" And the tattered sleeves,
that no one has care to mend, try to clasp the Wind, whom they take for
the Fashion, and drop back empty--The Wind has passed, the Wind is far!

THE PEACOCK
[_To the animals slightly dismayed by this address._] You poor-spirited
creatures, that thing cannot talk!

CHANTECLER
Man says the same of us.

THE PEACOCK
[_To the birds nearest to him._] He is vexed because of those Cocks whom
I introduced. [_To_ CHANTECLER, _ironically._] What, my dear sir, do you
say to these resplendent gentlemen?

CHANTECLER
I say, my dear sir, that these resplendent gentlemen are manufactured
wares, the work of merchants with highly complex brains, who to fashion
a ridiculous Chicken have taken a wing from that one, a topknot from
this. I say that in such Cocks nothing remains of the true Cock. They
are Cocks of shreds and patches, idle bric-a-brac, fit to figure in a
catalogue, not in a barnyard with its decent dunghill and its dog. I say
that those befrizzled, beruffled, bedeviled Cocks were never stroked and
cherished by Nature's maternal hand. I say that it's all Aviculture, and
Aviculture is flapdoodle! And I say that those preposterous parrots,
without style, without beauty, without form, whose bodies have not even
kept the pleasing oval of the egg they were hatched from, look like so
many desperate fowls escaped from some hen-coop of the Apocalypse!

A COCK
My dear sir--

CHANTECLER
[_With rising spirit._] And I add that the whole duty of a Cock is to be
an embodied crimson cry! And when a Cock is not that, it matters little
that his comb be shaped like a toadstool, or his quills twisted like a
screw, he will soon vanish and be heard of no more, having been nothing
but a variety of a variety!

A COCK
I protest--

CHANTECLER
[_Going from one to the other._] Yes, Cocks affecting incongruous forms,
Cocks crowned with cocoa-palm coiffures--Hear me talk like the Peacock!
I lapse into alliteration! [_Finding his fun in bewildering them with
cackling guttural volubility._] Yes, Cockerels cockaded with cockles,
Cockatrice-headed Cockasters, cock-eyed Cockatoos! Not content to be
common Cocks, your crotchet it was to be what but crack Cocks? Yes,
Fashion, to be accounted of thy flock, these chuckle-headed Cocks craved
to be Super-cocks. But know ye not, ye crazy Cocks, one cannot be so
queer a Cock, but there may occur a queerer Cock? Let some Cock come
whose coccyx boasts a more flamboyant shock, and you pass like childish
measles, croup or chicken-pox! Consider that to-morrow, high
Cockalorums, fancy Cocks, consider that day after to-morrow,
cheese-capped goblet-crested Cocks, in spite of curly hackle and
cauliflowered hocks, a more fantastic Cock than ever may creep out of
a--box! For the Cock-fancier, to diversify his stock, may more
fantastically still combine his Cutcutdaycuts and his Cocks, and you
will be no more--sad Cuckoos made a mock!--but old rococo Cocks beside
this more coquettish Cock!

A COCK
And how, may one learn from you, can a Cock secure himself against
becoming rococo?

CHANTECLER
One royal way there is: to think only of crowing like a right and proper
Cock!

A COCK
[_Haughtily._] We are well known, I beg to state, for our exceptionally
fine crowing!

CHANTECLER
Known to whom?



SCENE FIFTH

THE SAME, _three_ CHICKENS, _noticeable among the rest for a certain
jaunty pertness of gait and demeanour, who for a minute or so have been
moving among the artificial_ COCKS.


FIRST CHICKEN
To us, of course!

SECOND CHICKEN
To us!

THIRD CHICKEN
To us!

ALL THREE
[_Bowing at once._] Good morning!

FIRST CHICKEN
Your voice?

SECOND CHICKEN
Tenor?

THIRD CHICKEN
Bass?

SECOND CHICKEN
Robusto?

THIRD CHICKEN
Di cortesia?

CHANTECLER
[_Bewildered, looking toward the_ PHEASANT-HEN.] What is this? An
interlude?

THE PHEASANT-HEN
An interview.

SECOND CHICKEN
Do you take it in your chest?

THIRD CHICKEN
Or in your head?

CHANTECLER
Do I take what?

FIRST CHICKEN
Pray talk without reserve. We represent the Board of Investigation into
the Gallodoodle Movement.

CHANTECLER
That's all very well, but I--[_Attempting to pass._]

FIRST CHICKEN
You will find it difficult, I think, to leave, until you have answered
such questions as we are pleased to ask. Is your early meal a light one?

CHANTECLER
But--

SECOND CHICKEN
You have tendencies, no doubt--

CHANTECLER
Hosts.

SECOND CHICKEN
What do you feel most particularly drawn to?

CHANTECLER
Hens.

FIRST CHICKEN
[_Without smiling._] Have you nothing to communicate with regard to your
song?

CHANTECLER
I just sing.

SECOND CHICKEN
And when you sing--?

CHANTECLER
The heavens hear me.

THIRD CHICKEN
Have you a special method?

CHANTECLER
I--

FIRST CHICKEN
You live--

CHANTECLER
To sing!

SECOND CHICKEN
And your song--?

CHANTECLER
Is my life!

THIRD CHICKEN
But how do you sing?

CHANTECLER
I take pains.

FIRST CHICKEN
But do you scan [_Beating furiously with his wing._] one-one-two
One-three? Three-one? Or four? What is your dynamic theory?

THE BLACKBIRD
[_Shouting._] Who has not his little pet dynamic theory?

CHANTECLER
Dyna--?

SECOND CHICKEN
Where do you place the accent? On the Cock--?

THIRD CHICKEN
On the Doo?

CHANTECLER
On the--

FIRST CHICKEN
[_Impatiently._] What is your school?

CHANTECLER
Schools of Cocks?

SECOND CHICKEN
[_Rapidly._] Certainly. Some sing Cock-a-doodle-doo, and some
Keek-a-deedle-dee!

CHANTECLER
Cock--? Keek--?

THIRD CHICKEN
Not to speak of those who--

A COCK
[_Coming forward._] The correct and proper way to crow is
Cowkerdowdledow!

CHANTECLER
What Cock is that?

FIRST CHICKEN
An Anglo-Indian.

SECOND CHICKEN
And the Turk over there, whose comb suggests a cyst, crows
Coocooroocoocoo!

THIRD CHICKEN
[_Shouting in his ear._] Do you not upon occasions vary your
Cockadoodledoo with Cackadaddledaa?

ANOTHER COCK
[_Springing up at the right._] I, for one, entirely suppress the vowels:
C-ck-d-dl-d!

CHANTECLER
[_Trying to get away._] Is it a Welsh Rabbit dream?

ANOTHER COCK
[_Springing up at the left._] O-a-oo-e-oo! Have you ever tried
suppressing the consonants?

ANOTHER COCK
[_Pushing aside all the others._] I mix the whole thing
up--Cuck-o-deedle-daa!--in a free and supple song!

CHANTECLER
My brain reels!

ALL THE COCKS
[_Gathered about him, fighting._] No! Cuckodee--No, Cackadaa--No,
Coocooroo--

THE COCK
[_Who mixes all up._] The free Cockadoodle! The free crow is obligatory!

CHANTECLER
Pray, who is that, speaking with such authority?

FIRST CHICKEN
It is a wonderful Cock who has never sung at all.

CHANTECLER
[_In humble despair._] And I am only a Cock who sings!

EVERYBODY
[_Drawing away from him in disgust._] I wouldn't mention it if I were
you!

CHANTECLER
I give my song as the rose-tree gives its Rose!

THE PEACOCK
[_Sarcastically._] Ah, I was waiting for the Rose! [_Pitying laughter._]

CHANTECLER
[_Low, nervously, to the_ BLACKBIRD.] Is my prospective slayer going to
keep me waiting much longer?

EVERYONE
[_Disgusted._] The Rose? Oh!

THE GUINEA-HEN
If you must mention flowers, let them be rather less--

THE PEACOCK
Elementary. [_With the most disdainful impertinence._] So you are still
at the declension of _Rosa?_

CHANTECLER
I am, you--Peacock! You, I suppose, may be forgiven for speaking
slightingly of the Rose, being a rival candidate for the beauty prize.
[_Looking around him._] But I summon these Cocks, from Dorking to
Bantam, to defend with me--

A COCK
[_Nonchalantly._] Pray whom?

CHANTECLER
The Rose, _Rosam;_ to declare on the spot and forthwith--

THE BLACKBIRD
[_Ironically._] You set yourself up as the champion--

CHANTECLER
_Rosarum,_ of roses, I do!--To declare that worship
is due--

A COCK
To whom, pray?

CHANTECLER
To roses, _rosis!_--in whose hearts sleep rain-drops like essences in
fragrant vials, to declare that they are, and ever will be--

A VOICE
[_Cold and cutting._] Painted jades, things of naught! [_All the fancy_
COCKS _draw aside, revealing the_ WHITE PILE GAME COCK, _who appears,
tall and lean and sinister at the further end of their double row._]

CHANTECLER
At last!

THE BLACKBIRD
It's time to climb up on the chairs!

CHANTECLER
[_To the_ WHITE PILE.] Sir--

THE PHEASANT-HEN
You are never going to challenge that giant?

CHANTECLER
I am! To appear tall it is sufficient to talk on stilts! [_To the_ GAME
COCK, _slowly crossing the stage toward him._] Know that such a remark
is not to be endured, and permit me to tell you--[_Finding a_ CHICK
_between himself and the_ GAME COCK, _he gently puts him aside, saying_]
Run to your mother, tot! [_To the_ WHITE PILE, _looking insolently at
his docked comb_]--that you look like a Fool who has mislaid
his coxcomb!

THE WHITE PILE
[_Astonished._] Fool? Coxcomb? What? What? What?

CHANTECLER
[_Beak to beak with the_ GAME COCK.] What? What? What? [_A pause. They
arch themselves, with bristling neck-hackle._]

THE WHITE PILE
[_Emphatically._] In America, during my grand tour, I killed three
Claybornes in a day. I have killed two Sherwoods, three Smoks, and one
Sumatra. I have killed--let me advise anyone fighting me to take
something beforehand to keep down his pulse!--three Red-game at
Cambridge and ten Braekels at Bruges!

CHANTECLER
[_Very simply._] I, my dear sir, have never killed anything. But as I
have at different times succored, defended, protected, this one and
that, I might perhaps be called, in my own fashion, brave. You need not
take these mighty airs with me. I came here knowing that you would come.
That rose was dangled to afford you the opportunity for brutal
stupidity. You did not fail to nibble at its petals. Your name?

THE GAME COCK
White Pile. And yours?

CHANTECLER
Chantecler.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Running desperately to the_ DOG.] Patou!

CHANTECLER
[_To_ PATOU, _who is growling between his teeth._] You, keep out of this!

PATOU
So I will, but it's rrrrrrrough!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_To_ CHANTECLER.] A Cock does not risk his life for a Rose!

CHANTECLER
A slur upon a flower is a slur upon the Sun!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Running to the_ BLACKBIRD.] Do something! This must be patched up--You
know you had promised me!

THE BLACKBIRD
Everything can be patched up, my dear, except the quarrels of a fellow's
friends!

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_Giving loud cries of despair._] Horrible! Oh, horrible A five-o'clock
tea at which guests kill each other! How dreadful--[_To her son._] that
the Tortoise should not have got here yet!

A VOICE
[_Crying._] Chantecler, ten against one!

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_Seating her company, assisting the_ HENS _to climb upon flower-pots,
cold-frames, pumpkins._] Quick! quick!

THE BLACKBIRD
Our charming hostess is in great feather, doing the honours of an affair
of honour.

PATOU
[_To_ CHANTECLER.] Go in and thrash him. This crowd is longing for the
sight of your blood.

CHANTECLER
[_Sadly._] I was never anything but kind!

PATOU
[_Showing the ring which has formed, the faces lighted with hateful
eagerness._] Look at them! [_All necks are craned, all eyes shine; it is
hideous._ CHANTECLER _looks, understands, and bows his head._]

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_With a cry of rage._] It's a disgrace! A disgrace to the name of fowl!

CHANTECLER
[_Raising his head again._] So be it. But they shall at least learn
to-day who I was, and my secret--

PATOU
No, don't tell them, if it's what my old dreamer's heart has apprehended!

CHANTECLER
[_Addressing the multitude, in a loud voice, solemnly, like one
confessing his faith._] Know, all of you, that it is I--[_Deep silence
falls. To the_ WHITE PILE, _who has given a sign of impatience._] Your
pardon, excellent duellist, but I have a mind, before getting myself
killed, to do something brave--

THE WHITE PILE
[_Surprised._] Ah?

CHANTECLER
Yes,--get myself laughed at!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
No, dearest, no! Don't do it!

CHANTECLER
I wish to perish amid salvos of laughter! [_To the crowd._] Riot, spirit
of Mockery! Disciples of the Blackbird, prepare! [_In a still louder
voice, hammering home every word._] It is I, who, by my song, bring back
the light of day! [_Amazement, then vast laughter shakes the
multitude._] Is the merriment well under way? On guard!

THE GOLDEN PADUA COCK
[_Nodding his plume._] Gentlemen, engage!

VOICES
[_Amid storms of laughter._] Funny! Side-splitting! Was anything ever so
droll? I shall die laughing!

THE BLACKBIRD
The old Gallic love of a joke is not dead!

A CHICKEN
He sings light into the sky!

A DUCK
The Sun gets up to hear him!

CHANTECLER
[_Avoiding the blows which the_ WHITE PILE _is beginning to aim at
him._] Yes, it is I who give you back the Day!

A CHICK
And a jolly fine day it is!

CHANTECLER
[_While parrying and attacking._] The crowing of other Cocks, able
neither to make nor mar, is no better nor worse than sonorous sneezing!
Mine--[_He is wounded._]

A VOICE
Biff! In the neck!

CHANTECLER
--mine makes--[_He is again wounded._]

THE TURKEY
Insufferable self-sufficiency!

CHANTECLER
--the light--[_Again he is struck._]

A VOICE
Biff! On the neb!

CHANTECLER
--the light appear!

A VOICE
Biff! In the eye!

CHANTECLER
[_Blinded with blood._] Yes, the light!

A VOICE
[_Sneering._] Better have let sleeping darkness lie!

CHANTECLER
[_Automatically repeating beneath his adversary's blows._] It is I who
make the dawn appear!

PATOU
[_Barking._] Aye! Aye! Aye!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Sobbing._] Stand up to him, darling! Oh, hit back! Hit back!

A CHICK
Fellows, a nickname for the dawn!

ALL
Yes! Yes!

[_The_ WHITE PILE _hurls himself upon_ CHANTECLER.]

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Oh, cruel!

THE BLACKBIRD
Chantecler's Light o' Love!

A VOICE
A nickname for the Cock!

ALL
Yes! Yes!

THE BLACKBIRD
Grand Master of Illuminations!

ANOTHER VOICE
Purveyor of Sunny Beams!

CHANTECLER
[_Defending himself foot to foot._] Thanks! Another quip, for I can
still fight with my feet!

A VOICE
The Alarm-Cock!

CHANTECLER
[_Who seems upheld by their insults._] Another pun! And I who know no
more of fighting than can be learned on a peaceful farm--

A VOICE
Thresh out his hayseed!

CHANTECLER
Thanks! I--[_His torn feathers fly around him._]

CRY OF JOY
See his fur fly!

CHANTECLER
I feel--Another pleasantry!

A VOICE
Lay on, Macfluff!

CHANTECLER
Thanks! I feel that the more I am mocked, insulted, flouted, and denied--

AN ASS
[_Stretching his neck over the hedge._] Hee-haw!

CHANTECLER
Thanks!--the better I shall fight!

THE WHITE PILE
[_Chuckling._] He is game, but he's giving out.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Enough. Enough. Oh, stop!

A VOICE
On White Pile, twenty to one!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Seeing_ CHANTECLER'S _bleeding neck._] He bleeds, oh!

A HEN
[_Rising on tiptoe behind the_ GOLDEN PADUA COCK.] I should like to see
the blood!

THE WHITE PILE
[_Increasing the fury of his onset._] I'll have your gizzard!

THE HEN
[_Trying to see._] The Padua Cock's hat shuts off my view!

THE BLACKBIRD
Hats off!

A VOICE
That was a stinger! On his comb!

SHRILL CRIES
[_From the crowd._] Land him one! Do him up! Lay him out! Have his gore!

PATOU
[_Standing up in his wheelbarrow._] Will you stop behaving like human
beings?

CRIES
[_Furiously keeping time with the blows showering upon_ CHANTECLER.] In
the neck! On the nut! On the wing! On the--[_Sudden silence._]

CHANTECLER
[_Amazed._] What is this? The ring breaks up, the shouting dies--[_He
looks around. The_ WHITE PILE _has drawn away and backed against the
hedge. A strange commotion agitates the crowd._ CHANTECLER, _exhausted,
bleeding, tottering, does not understand, and murmurs._] What joke are
they preparing against my end? [_And suddenly._] Joy, Patou, joy!

PATOU
What?

CHANTECLER
I have done them an injustice. All of them, ceasing to insult and mock
me, look, gather round me, closer and closer--look!

PATOU
[_Seeing them all, in fact, crowding around_ CHANTECLER, _and gazing
anxiously at the sky, looks up too, and says simply._] It is the hawk!

CHANTECLER
Ah! [_A dark shadow slowly sweeps over the motley crowd, who crouch and
cower._]

PATOU
When that great shadow falls, it is not the fine, strange Cocks we trust
to keep off the bird of prey!

CHANTECLER
[_Suddenly grown great of size, his wounds forgotten, stands in the
midst of them, and in an authoritative tone._] Yes, close around me, all
of you, all! [_All, huddled in their feathers, their heads drawn in
between their wings, press against him._]

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Dear, brave, and gentle heart!

CHANTECLER
[_The shadow sweeps over the crowd a second time. The_ GAME COCK _makes
himself small._ CHANTECLER _alone remains standing, in the midst of a
heap of ruffled, trembling feathers._]

A HEN
[_Looking up at the_ HAWK.] Twice the black shadow has swept over us!

CHANTECLER
[_Calling to the_ CHICKS, _who come madly running._] Chicks, come here
to me!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
You take them under your wing?

CHANTECLER
I must. Their mother is a box!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Looking upward._] He hovers over us--[_The shadow of the_ HAWK,
_circling lower and lower, passes for the third time, darker
than ever._]

ALL
[_In a moan of fear._] Ah!

CHANTECLER
[_Shouting toward the sky._] I am here!

PATOU
He has heard your trumpet cry!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
He flies further.

[_All rise with a joyous cry of deliverance, "Ah!" and go back to their
places to watch the end of the combat._]

PATOU
Without loss of a moment they form the ring again.

CHANTECLER
[_With a start._] What did you say? [_He looks. It is true, the ring has
immediately formed._]

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Now they want you killed to be revenged for their fine scare.

CHANTECLER
But now I shall not be killed! I felt my strength come back when the
common enemy flew across the sky. [_Striding boldly up to the_ WHITE
PILE.] I got back my courage, fearing for the others.

THE WHITE PILE
[_Amazed at being smartly attacked._] Whence has he drawn new strength?

CHANTECLER
I am thrice stronger now than you. Black excites me, you see, as red
excites the bull, and thrice I have stared at night in the form of a
bird's shadow!

THE WHITE PILE
[_Driven to bay, against the hedge, prepares to use his razors._]

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Screaming._] Look out! He has two sharp razors at his heels, the beast!

CHANTECLER
I knew it!

THE CAT
[_From his tree, to the_ GAME COCK.] Use your knives!

PATOU
[_Ready to spring from his wheelbarrow._] If he uses those, I'll
strangle him, that's all!

THE CROWD
Oh!

PATOU
I will! Howl you never so loud!

THE WHITE PILE
[_Feeling himself lost._] No help for it!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Closely watching him._] He is getting one of his razors ready!

THE WHITE PILE
[_Striking with his sharp spur._] Take that! Die! [_He utters a terrible
cry, while_ CHANTECLER, _avoiding the blow, springs aside._] Ah! [_He
drops to the ground. Cry of amazement._]

SEVERAL VOICES
What is it?

THE BLACKBIRD
[_Who has hopped up to the fallen_ COCK _and examined him._] Nothing!
Merely he has dexterously slashed his left claw with his right!

THE CROWD
[_Following and hooting the_ WHITE PILE, _who, having picked himself up,
limps off._] Hoo! Hoo!

PATOU _and the_ PHEASANT-HEN
[_Laughing and weeping and talking, all in one, beside_ CHANTECLER,
_who stands motionless, utterly spent, with closed eyes._] Chantecler!
It is we! The Pheasant-hen! The Dog! Speak to us, speak!

CHANTECLER
[_Opening his eyes, looks at them and says gently._] The day will rise
to-morrow!



SCENE SIXTH

THE SAME, _except the_ WHITE PILE


THE CROWD
[_After seeing the_ WHITE PILE _off, return tumultuously to_ CHANTECLER,
_hailing him with acclamations._] Hurrah!

CHANTECLER
[_Drawing away from them, in a terrible voice._] Stand back! I know your
worth! [_The crowd hastily draws back._]

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Close by his side._] Come away to the woods, where true-hearted
animals live!

CHANTECLER
No, I will stay here.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
After finding them out?

CHANTECLER
After finding them out.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
You will stay here?

CHANTECLER
Not for their sakes, but the sake of my song. It might spring forth less
clear from any other soil! But now, to inform the Day that it is sure to
be called tomorrow I will sing! [_Obsequious movement of the crowd,
attempting to approach._] Back! All of you! I have nothing left but my
song! [ALL _draw away, and alone in his pride, he begins._] Co--[_To
himself, stiffening himself against pain._] Nothing left but my song,
therefore let us sing well! [_He tries again._] Co--Now, I wonder,
shall I take it as a chest-note, or--Co--a head-note? Shall I count
one-three, or--Co--And the accent? Since they filled my head with all
that sort of thing, I--Coocooroo--Keekee-ree--And the theory? The
dynamic theory? Cock-a--I am all tangled up in schools and rules and
rubbish! If he reduced his flight to a theory, what eagle would ever
soar? Co--[_Trying again, and ending in a raucous, abortive crow._]
Co--I cannot sing any more, I, whose method was not to know how, but be
quite certain why! [_In a cry, of despair._] I have nothing left! They
have taken everything from me, my song and everything else. How shall I
get it back?

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Opening her wings._] Come away to the woods!

CHANTECLER
[_Falling upon her breast._] I love you!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
To the woods, where the simple birds sing their sweet unconscious songs!

CHANTECLER
Let us go! [_Both go toward the back._ CHANTECLER _turning._] But there
is one thing I wish to say--

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Trying to lead him away._] Come to the woods!

CHANTECLER
--to all the Guineahennery gathered beneath these arbors. Let the
garden--the Bees agree with me, I fancy!--let the garden work untroubled
at changing its blossoms into fruit--

BUZZING OF BEES
_We agree--ee--ee_!

CHANTECLER
Nothing good is ever accomplished in the midst of noise. Noise prevents
the bough--

BUZZING
[_Further off._]
_So say we--e--e! we--e--e_!

CHANTECLER
--from bringing its apple to perfection, prevents the grape--

BUZZING
[_Dying away among the foliage._] _So say we--e--e_!

CHANTECLER
--from ripening on the vine. [_Going toward the back with the_
PHEASANT-HEN.] Let us go! [_Turning and coming again angrily toward the
front._] But I wish furthermore to say to these H--[_The_ PHEASANT-HEN
_lays her wing across his beak._]--ens that those unnatural Cocks will
lightly take themselves away, back to the gilded mangers of their sole
affection, the moment they hear the cry of Chick-chick-chick-chick-chick!
[_Imitating a servant girl calling_ CHICKENS _to feed._] For all those
charlatans are stalking appetites, and nothing more!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Trying to lead him off._] Come! Come!

A HEN
She is eloping with him.

CHANTECLER
I am coming! But--[_Coming forward again._] I must first say to this
Peacock, in the presence of that Addlepate--[_Indicating the_
GUINEA-HEN.]

THE GUINEA-HEN
He insults me in my own house. Sensational!

CHANTECLER
False hero whom Fashion has taken for leader, you walk in such terror of
appearing behindhand to the eyes of your own tail that your throat is
blue with it! But, urged forward, on and on, by every staring eye upon
it, you will fall at last, breathless for good and all, and end in the
false immortality bestowed, false artist, by the--[_Imitating the manner
of the_ PEACOCK.] shall I say bird-stuffer?

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_Mechanically._] Yes!

CHANTECLER
No. Taxidermist,--to use the word you would prefer. That, my dear
Peacock, is what I wished to say.

THE BLACKBIRD
Bang!

CHANTECLER
[_Turning toward him._] As for you--

THE BLACKBIRD
Fire away!

CHANTECLER
I will! You became acquainted one grey morning with a city sparrow, did
you not tell us so? That was your ruin. You have been possessed ever
since with the desire to appear like one yourself.

THE BLACKBIRD
But--

CHANTECLER
From that hour, unresting, acting the sparrow night and day, the sparrow
even in sleep, self-condemned to play the sparrow without respite, you
have appeared--famous jay!

THE BLACKBIRD
But--

CHANTECLER
Pathetic effort of a country birdkin, twisting his thick bill to talk
with a city accent! Ah, you wish to bite off bits of slang? My friend,
they are green! Every grape you pick breaks in your jaws, for city
grapes are glass bubbles! Having taken from the sparrow only his make-up
and grimace, you are just a clumsy understudy, a sort of vice-buffoon!
And you serve up stale old cynicisms picked up with crumbs in
fashionable club-rooms, poor little bird, and think to astonish us with
your budget of scandalous news--

THE BLACKBIRD
But--

CHANTECLER
I have not exhausted my ammunition! You wish to imitate the sparrow? But
the sparrow does not, slyly and meanly mischievous, make a cult of
sprightliness is not funny with authority, is not the pedant of
flippancy! You percher among low bushes, who never care to fly, you wish
to imitate--[_Turning to one of the exotic_ COCKS _cackling behind
him._] Silence, Cock of Japan! or I shall spoil a picture!

THE JAPANESE COCK
[_Hurriedly._] I beg your pardon!

CHANTECLER
[_Continuing to the_ BLACKBIRD.] You wish to imitate the sparrow, who,
rising on light wing, underlines his words with a telegraph wire! Very
well, I hate to grieve you, but--you know I can hear the sparrows when
they come to steal my corn!--you are not in it, you do not pull it off.
Your lingo is a fake!

THE BLACKBIRD
A--?

CHANTECLER
And your performance is a shine!

THE BLACKBIRD
He can talk slang?

CHANTECLER
I can talk anything!--It's the Paris article made in Germany!

THE BLACKBIRD
But--

CHANTECLER
Fire away, I think you said. I hope you don't mind my air-gun?

THE BLACKBIRD
I--

CHANTECLER
The Grand Master of Illuminations is entirely at your service. What do
you say?

THE BLACKBIRD
[_Hastily._] Nothing! [_He tries to get away._]

CHANTECLER
You wish to ape the sparrow of city streets! But his impudence is not a
manner of prudence, an art of remaining vague, an elegant method of
having no opinion. His eyes always express either wrath or delight. Do
you care to know the secret by which the little beggar, with his
"Chappie" and his "See" can steal away our hearts? It is that he is
frank and fearless that he believes, that he loves, that the railings of
a balcony where some child strews crumbs for him are the only cage he
ever knew! It is that one can be sure of his gaiety of soul, since he is
gay when he is hungry! But you who, void of gaiety because void of love,
have imagined that evil wit can take the place of good humour, and that
one can play the sparrow when he is a sleek and vulgar trimmer,
sniggering behind his wing, what I say to you is, "Guess again,
Mock-sparrow, guess again!"

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_Always applauding everything that is said at her receptions._] Good!
That was extremely good!

A CHICKEN
[_To the crestfallen_ BLACKBIRD.] You will make him smart for this?

THE BLACKBIRD
[_Prudently._] No. I will take it out on the Turkey. [_At this point a_
VOICE _calls, "Chick-chick-chick-chick-chick!" and all the_ FANCY COCKS,
_rushing toward the irresistible call to food, hurry out, tumbling over
one another in their haste._]

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_Running after them._] Are you going?

A PADUA COCK
[_The last to leave._] I beg to be excused! [_Disappears._]

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_In the midst of the hubbub._] Are you going? Must you go? Oh, don't go
yet!

CHANTECLER
[_To the_ PHEASANT-HEN.] Come, my golden Pheasant!

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_Running to_ CHANTECLER.] Are you running away?

CHANTECLER
To save my song!

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_Running to the_ YOUNG GUINEA-COCK.] My son, I am in such a state--I am
in such--

A HEN
[_Calling after_ CHANTECLER.] And when shall we see you again?

CHANTECLER
[_Before going._] When you have grown teeth! [_Off with the_
PHEASANT-HEN.]

THE GUINEA-HEN
[_To the_ YOUNG GUINEA-COCK.] This has been quite the finest affair of
the season! [_Darting madly about among the departing guests._] Au
revoir! Mondays in August! Don't forget!

THE MAGPIE
[_Announcing._] The Tortoise!





ACT FOURTH

THE NIGHT OF THE NIGHTINGALE

_In the Forest. Evening. Huge trees with thick gnarled roots. At the
base of one of the trees, Time or a lightning stroke has hollowed a sort
of chamber. Rising slopes carpeted with heather. Rabbit holes. Mosses.
Toadstools. Stretched between two ferns, a great cobweb, spangled with
water-drops. At the rise of the curtain_, RABBITS _are discovered on
every side among the underbrush, peacefully inhaling the evening air. A
time of serene silence and coolness._


SCENE FIRST

_A_ RABBIT _in front of his burrow_, CHOIR OF UNSEEN BIRDS.


A RABBIT
It is the hour when with sweet and solemn voices the two warblers,
Black-cap of the Gardens, and Red-wing of the Woods, intone the
evening prayer.

A VOICE
[_Among the branches._] O God of Birds!

ANOTHER VOICE
  O God of Birds! or, rather, for the Hawk
  Has surely not the same God as the Wren,
  O God of Little Birds!

A THOUSAND VOICES
[_Among the leaves._] O God of Little Birds!

FIRST VOICE
  Who breathed into our wings to make us light,
  And painted them with colours of His sky,
  All thanks for this fair day, for meat and drink--
  Sweet sky-born water caught in cups of stone,
  Sweet hedgerow berries washed of dust with dew,
  And thanks for these good little eyes of ours
  That spy the unseen enemies of man,
  And thanks for the good tools by Thee bestowed
  To aid our work of little gardeners,
  Trowels and pruning-hooks of living horn.

THE SECOND VOICE
  To-morrow we will fight borer and blight,
  Forgive Thy birds to-night their trespasses,
  The stripping of a currant-bush or two!

THE FIRST VOICE
  Breathe on our bright round eyes and over them
  The triple curtain of the lids will close.
  If Man, the unjust, pay us by casting stones,
  For filling field and wood and eaves with song,
  For battling with the weevil for his bread,
  If he lime twigs for us, if he spread snares,
  Call to our memory Thy gentle Saint,
  Thy good Saint Francis, that we may forgive
  The cruelty of men because a man
  Once called us brothers, "My brothers, the birds!"

THE SECOND VOICE
  Saint Francis of Assisi--

A THOUSAND VOICES
[_Among the leaves._] Pray for us!

THE VOICE
  Confessor of the mavis--

ALL THE VOICES
  Pray for us!

THE VOICE
  Preacher to the swallows--

ALL THE VOICES
  Pray for us!

THE VOICE
  O tender dreamer of a generous dream,
  Who didst believe so surely in our soul
  That, ever since, our soul, and ever more,
  Affirms, defines itself--

ALL THE VOICES
  Remember us!

THE FIRST VOICE
  And by the favour of thy prayers obtain
  The needful daily sup and crumb! Amen.

THE SECOND VOICE
  Amen!

ALL THE VOICES
[_In a murmur spreading to the uttermost ends of the forest._] Amen!

CHANTECLER
[_Who, having a moment before stepped from the hollow tree, has stood
listening._] Amen!

[_The shade has deepened and taken a bluer tinge. The spiderweb, touched
by a moonbeam, looks as if sifting silver dust. The_ PHEASANT-HEN _comes
from the tree and follows_ CHANTECLER _with little short
feminine steps._]



SCENE SECOND

CHANTECLER, _the_ PHEASANT-HEN, _from time to time the_ RABBITS, _now
and then the_ WOODPECKER.


CHANTECLER
How softly sleeps the moonlight on the ferns! Now is the time--

A LITTLE QUAVERING VOICE
  Spider at night,
  Bodeth delight!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Thanks, kind Spider!

CHANTECLER
Now is the time--

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Close behind him._] Now is the time to kiss me.

CHANTECLER
All those Rabbits looking on make it a trifle--

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Suddenly flaps her wings; the frightened_ RABBITS _start, on all sides
white tails disappear into rabbit-holes. The_ PHEASANT-HEN _coming back
to_ CHANTECLER.] There! [_They bill._] Do you love my forest?

CHANTECLER
I love it, for no sooner had I crossed its verdant border than I got
back my song. Let us go to roost. I must sing very early to-morrow.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Imperiously._] But one song only!

CHANTECLER
Yes.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
For a month I have only allowed you one song.

CHANTECLER
[_Resignedly._] Yes.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
And has the Sun not risen just the same?

CHANTECLER
[_In a tone of unwilling admission._] The Sun has risen.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
You see that one can have the Dawn at a smaller cost. Is the sky any
less red for your only crowing once?

CHANTECLER
No.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Well then? [_Offering her bill._] A kiss! [_Finding his kiss
absent-minded._] You are thinking of something else. Please attend!
[_Reverting to her idea._] Why should you wear yourself out? You were
simply squandering the precious copper of your voice. Daylight is all
very well, but one must live! Oh! the male creature! If we were not
there, with what sad frequency he would be fooled!

CHANTECLER
[_With conviction._] Yes, but you are there, you see.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
It is barbarous anyhow to keep up a perpetual cockaduddling when I am
trying to sleep.

CHANTECLER
[_Gently correcting her._] Doodling, dearest.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Duddling is correct.

CHANTECLER
Doodling.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Raising her head toward the top of the tree and calling._] Mr.
Woodpecker! [_To_ CHANTECLER.] We will ask the learned gentleman in the
green coat. [_To the_ WOODPECKER _the upper half of whose figure appears
at a round hole high up in the tree trunk; his coat is green, his
waistcoat buff, and he wears a red skull-cap._] Do you say cockaduddling
or cockadoodling?

THE WOODPECKER
[_Bending a long professorial bill._] Both.

CHANTECLER _and the_ PHEASANT-HEN
[_Turning to each other, triumphantly._] Ah!

THE WOODPECKER
Duddling is more tender, doodling more poetic. [_He disappears._]

CHANTECLER
It is for you I cockaduddle!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Yes, but you cockadoodle for the Dawn!

CHANTECLER
[_Going toward her._] I do believe you are jealous!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Retreating coquettishly._] Do you love me more than her?

CHANTECLER
[_With a cry of warning._] Be careful, a snare!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Jumping aside._] Ready to spring! [_Dimly visible against a tree, is,
in fact, a spread bird-net._]

CHANTECLER
[_Examining it._] A dangerous contrivance.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Forbidden by the game-laws of 44.

CHANTECLER
[_Laughing._] Do you know that?

THE PHEASANT-HEN
You seem to forget that the object of your affections comes under the
head of game.

CHANTECLER
[_With a touch of sadness._] It is true that we are of different kinds.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Returning to his side with a hop._] I want you to love me more than
her. Say it's me you love most. Say it's me!

THE WOODPECKER
[_Reappearing._] I!

CHANTECLER
[_Looking up._] Not in a love-scene.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_To the_ WOODPECKER.] See here,--you! Be so kind another time as to knock!

WOODPECKER
[_Disappearing._] Certainly. Certainly.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_To_ CHANTECLER.] He has a bad habit of thrusting his bill between the
bark and the tree, but he is a rare scholar, exceptionally well
informed--

CHANTECLER
[_Absent-mindedly._] On what subjects?

THE PHEASANT-HEN
The language of birds.

CHANTECLER
Indeed?

THE PHEASANT-HEN
For, you know, the birds when they say their prayers speak the common
language, but when they chat together in private they use a twittering
dialect, wholly onomatopoetic.

CHANTECLER
They talk Japanese. [_The_ WOODPECKER _knocks three times with his bill
on the tree: Rat-tat-tat!_] Come in!

THE WOODPECKER
[_Appearing, indignant._] Japanese, did you say?

CHANTECLER
Yes. Some of them say, Tio! Tio! and others say Tzoui! Tzoui!

THE WOODPECKER
Birds have talked Greek ever since Aristophanes!

CHANTECLER
[_Rushing to the_ PHEASANT-HEN.] Oh, for the love of Greek! [_They bill._]

THE WOODPECKER
Know, profane youth, that the Black-chat's cry Ouis-ouis-tra-tra, is a
corruption of the word Lysistrata! [_Disappears._]

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_To_ CHANTECLER.] Will you never love anyone but me?

[THE WOODPECKER'S _knock is heard: Rat-tat-tat._]

CHANTECLER
Come in!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_To_ CHANTECLER.] Do you promise?

THE WOODPECKER
[_Appears, soberly nodding his red cap._] Tiri-para! sings the small
sedge-warbler to the reeds. Incontrovertibly from the Greek. _Para,_
along, and the word water is understood. [_Disappears._]

CHANTECLER
He has Greek on the brain!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Reverting to her idea._] Am I the whole, whole world to you?

CHANTECLER
Of course you are, only--

THE PHEASANT-HEN
In my green-sleeved Oriental robe, I look to you--how do I look?

CHANTECLER
Like a living commandment ever to worship that which comes from the East.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Exasperated._] Will you stop thinking of the light of day, and think
only of the light in my eyes?

CHANTECLER
I shall never forget, however, that there was a morning when we believed
equally in my Destiny, and that in the radiant hour of dawning love you
forgot, and allowed me to forget, your gold for the gold of the Dawn!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
The Dawn! Always the Dawn! Be careful, Chantecler I shall do something
rash! [_Going toward the Back._]

CHANTECLER
You will infallibly do as you like.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
In the glade not long ago I met the--[_She catches herself and stops
short, intentionally._]

CHANTECLER
[_Looks at her, and in an angry cry._] The Pheasant? [_With sudden
violence._] Promise me that you will never again go to the glade!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Assured of her power over him, with a bound returns to his side._] And
you, promise that you will love me more than the Light!

CHANTECLER
[_Sorrowfully._] Oh!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
That you will not sing--

CHANTECLER
More than one song, we have settled that point. [_Rat-tat-tat, from the_
WOODPECKER.] Come in!

THE WOODPECKER
[_Appearing and pointing with his bill at the net._] The snare! The
farmer placed it there. He declared he would capture the Pheasant-hen.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
He flatters himself!

THE WOODPECKER
And that he would keep you on his farm.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Indignant._] Alive? [_To_ CHANTECLER, _in a tone of reproach._] Your
farm!

CHANTECLER
[_Seeing a_ RABBIT _who has returned to the edge of his hole._] Ah,
there comes a Rabbit!

THE RABBIT
[_Showing the snare to the_ PHEASANT-HEN.] You know if you put your foot
on that spring--

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_In a tone of superiority._] I know all about snares, my little man. If
you put your foot on that spring, the thing shuts. I am afraid of
nothing but dogs. [_To_ CHANTECLER.] On your farm, which you secretly
yearn for.

CHANTECLER
[_In a voice of injured innocence._] I?

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_To the_ RABBIT, _giving him a light tap with her wing to send him
home._] Afraid of nothing but dogs. And since you put me in mind of it,
I think I must go and perplex their noses, by tangling my tracks all
among the grass and underwoods.

CHANTECLER
That's it, you go and fool the dogs!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Starts of, then returns._] You are homesick for that wretched old farm
of yours?

CHANTECLER
I? I? [_She goes off. He repeats indignantly._] I? [_Watching her out of
sight, then, dropping his voice, to the_ WOODPECKER.] She is not coming
back, is she?

THE WOODPECKER
[_Who from his high window in the tree can look off._] No.



SCENE THIRD

CHANTECLER, THE WOODPECKER.


CHANTECLER
[_Eagerly._] Keep watch! They are going to talk with me from home.

THE WOODPECKER
[_Interested._] Who?

CHANTECLER
The Blackbird.

THE WOODPECKER
I thought he hated you.

CHANTECLER
He came near it, but the Blackbird cast of mind admits of compromise,
and it amuses him to keep me informed.

THE WOODPECKER
Is he coming?

CHANTECLER
[_Who is a different bird since the_ PHEASANT-HEN'S _exit,
light-hearted, boyishly cheerful._] No, but the blue morning-glory
opening in his cage amid the wistaria, communicates by subterranean
filaments with this white convolvulus trembling above the pool. [_Going
to the convolvulus._] So that by talking into its chalice--[_He plunges
his bill into one of the trembling milky trumpets._] Hello!

THE WOODPECKER
[_Nodding to himself._] From the Greek, _allos_, another.
He talks with another.

CHANTECLER
Hello! The Blackbird, please!

THE WOODPECKER
[_Keeping watch._] Most imprudent, this is! To choose among the
convolvuli exactly the one which--

CHANTECLER
[_Lighter and lighter of mood, returning to the_ WOODPECKER.] But it's
the only one open all night! When the Blackbird answers, the Bee who
sleeps in the flower wakes up and we--

THE BEE
[_Inside the convolvulus._] Vrrrrrrrrr!

CHANTECLER
[_Briskly running to the flower and listening at the horn-shaped
receiver._] Ah? This morning, did you say?

THE WOODPECKER
[_Filled with curiosity._] What is it?

CHANTECLER
[_In a voice of sudden emotion._] Thirty chicks have been born!
[_Listening again._] Briffaut, the hunting-dog, is ill? [_As if
something interfered with his hearing._] I believe it is the
Dragon-flies, deafening us with the crackling of their wings--[_Shouting._]
Will you be so kind, young ladies, as not to cut us off? [_Listening._]
And big Julius obliges Patou to go with him on his hunting expeditions?
[_To the_ WOODPECKER.] Ah, you ought to know my friend Patou! [_Burying
his bill again in the flower._] So? Without me everything goes wrong? Yes!
[_With satisfaction._] Yes! Waste and carelessness naturally!

THE WOODPECKER
[_Who has been keeping watch, warns him suddenly under breath._] Here
she comes!

CHANTECLER
[_With his bill in the flower._] Indeed?

THE WOODPECKER
[_Fluttering desperately._] Hush!

CHANTECLER
The Ducks spent the night under the cart, did they?

THE WOODPECKER
Pst!



SCENE FOURTH
THE SAME, THE PHEASANT-HEN

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Who has come upon the scene, with a threatening gesture at the_
WOODPECKER.] Go inside! [_The_ WOOD PECKER _precipitately disappears.
She stands listening to_ CHANTECLER.]

CHANTECLER
[_In the convolvulus, more and more deeply interested._] You don't mean
it! What, all of them?--Yes?--No--Oh!--Well, well!--Is that so?

THE WOODPECKER
[_Who has timidly come back, aside._] Oh, that an ant of the heaviest
might weigh down his tongue!

CHANTECLER
[_Talking into the flower._] So soon? The Peacock out of fashion?

THE WOODPECKER
[_Trying to get_ CHANTECLER'S _attention behind the_ PHEASANT-HEN'S
_back._] Pst!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Turning around, furious._] You!--You had better! [_The_ WOODPECKER
_alertly retires, bumping his head._]

CHANTECLER
[_In the flower._] An elderly Cock?--I hope that the Hens--? [_With
intonations more and more expressive of relief._] Ah, that's right!
that's right! that's right! [_He ends, with evident lightening of the
heart._] A father! [_As if answering a question._] Do I sing? Yes, but
far away from here, at the water-side.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Oh!

CHANTECLER
[_With a tinge of bitterness._] Golden Pheasants will not long allow one
to purchase glory by too strenuous an effort, and so I go off by myself,
and work at the Dawn in secret.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Approaching from behind with threatening countenance._] Oh!

CHANTECLER
As soon as the beauteous eye which enthralls me--

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Pausing._] Oh!

CHANTECLER
--closes, and in her surpassing loveliness she sleeps--

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Delighted._] Ah!

CHANTECLER
I make my escape.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Furious._] Oh!

CHANTECLER
I speed through the dew to a distant place, to sing there the necessary
number of times, and when I feel the darkness wavering, when only one
song more is needed, I return and noiselessly getting back to roost,
wake the Pheasant-hen by singing it at her side.--Betrayed by the dew?
Oh, no! [_Laughing._] For with a whisk of my wing I brush my feet clear
of the tell-tale silveriness!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Close behind him._] You brush your--?

CHANTECLER
[_Turning._] Ouch! [_Into the convolvulus._] No nothing! I--Later!--Ouch!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Violently._] So! So! Not only you keep up an interest in the fidelity
of your old flames--

CHANTECLER
[_Evasively._] Oh!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
You furthermore--

CHANTECLER
I--

THE BEE
[_Inside the morning-glory._] Vrrrrrrr!

CHANTECLER
[_Placing his wing over the flower._] I--

THE PHEASANT-HEN
You deceive me to the point of remembering to brush off your feet!

CHANTECLER
But--

THE PHEASANT-HEN
This clodhopper, see now, whom I picked up off his haystack--and to rule
alone in his soul is apparently quite beyond my power!

CHANTECLER
[_Collecting himself and straightening up._] When one dwells in a soul,
it is better, believe me, to meet with the Dawn there, than
with nothing.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Angrily._] No! the Dawn defrauds me of a great and undivided love!

CHANTECLER
There is no great love outside the shadow of a great dream! How should
there not flow more love from a soul whose very business it is to open
wide every day?

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Coming and going stormily._] I will sweep everything aside with my
golden russet wing!

CHANTECLER
And who are you, bent upon such tremendous sweeping [_They stand rigid
and erect in front of each other, looking defiance into each
other's eyes._]

THE PHEASANT-HEN
The Pheasant-hen I am, who have assumed the golden plumage of the
arrogant male!

CHANTECLER
Remaining in spite of all a female, whose eternal rival is the Idea!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_In a great cry._] Hold me to your heart and be still!

CHANTECLER
[_Crushing her brutally to him._] Yes, I strain you to my Cock's
heart--[_With infinite regret._] Better it were I had folded you to my
Awakener's soul!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
To deceive me for the Dawn's sake! Very well, however much you may abhor
it, you shall for my sake deceive the Dawn.

CHANTECLER
I? How?

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Stamping her foot; in a capricious tone._] It is my formal and
explicit wish--

CHANTECLER
But listen, dear--

THE PHEASANT-HEN
My formal and explicit wish that you should for one whole day refrain
altogether from singing.

CHANTECLER
That I--

THE PHEASANT-HEN
I desire you to remain one whole day without singing.

CHANTECLER
But, heavens and earth, am I to leave the valley in total darkness?

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Pouting._] What harm will it do to the valley?

CHANTECLER
Whatever lies too long in darkness and sleep becomes used to falsehood
and consents to death.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Leave singing for one day--[_In a tone of evil insinuation._] It will
free my mind of certain suspicions troubling it.

CHANTECLER
[_With a start._] I can see what you are trying to do!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
And I can see what you are afraid of!

CHANTECLER
[_Earnestly._] I will never give up singing.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
And what if you were mistaken? What if the truth were that Dawn comes
without help from you?

CHANTECLER
[_With fierce resolution._] I shall not know it.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_In a sudden burst of tears._] Could you not forget the time, for once,
if you saw me weeping?

CHANTECLER
No, I could not.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Nothing, ever, can make you forget the time?

CHANTECLER
Nothing. I am conscious of darkness as too heavy a weight.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
You are conscious of darkness as--Shall I tell you the truth? You think
you sing for the Dawn, but you sing in reality to be admired,
you--songster, you! [_With contemptuous pity._] Is it possible you are
not aware that your poor notes raise a smile right through the forest,
accustomed to the fluting of the thrush?

CHANTECLER
I know, you are trying now to reach me through my pride, but--

THE PHEASANT-HEN
I doubt if you can get so many as three toadstools and a couple of
sassafras stalks to listen to you, when the ardent oriole flings across
the leafy gloom his melodious pir-piriol!

THE WOODPECKER
[_Reappearing._] From the Greek: Pure, _puros._

CHANTECLER
No more from you, please! [_The_ WOODPECKER _hurriedly withdraws._]

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Insisting._] The echo must make some rather interesting mental
reservations, one fancies, when he hears you sing after hearing the
great Nightingale!

CHANTECLER
[_Turning to leave._] My nerves, my dear girl, are not of the very
steadiest to-night.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Following._] Did you ever hear him?

CHANTECLER
Never.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
His song is so wonderful that the first time--[_She stops short, struck
by an idea._] Oh!

CHANTECLER
What is it?

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Aside._] Ah, you feel the weight of the darkness--

CHANTECLER
[_Coming forward again._] What?

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_With an ironical curtsey._] Nothing! [_Carelessly._] Let us go to
roost! [CHANTECLER _goes to the back and is preparing to rise to a
branch. The_ PHEASANT-HEN _aside._] He does not know that when the
Nightingale sings one listens, supposing it to be a minute, and lo! the
whole night has been spent listening, even as happens in the enchanted
forest of a German legend.

CHANTECLER
[_As she does not join him, returns to her._] What are you saying?

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Laughing in his face._] Nothing!

A VOICE
[_Outside._] The illustrious Cock?

CHANTECLER
[_Looking around him._] I am wanted?

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Who has gone in the direction from whence came the voice._] There, in
the grass! [_Jumping back._] Mercy upon us! They are the--[_With a
movement of insuperable disgust._] They are the--[_With a spring she
conceals herself in the hollow tree, calling back to_ CHANTECLER.] Be
civil to them!



SCENE FIFTH

CHANTECLER, _the_ PHEASANT-HEN, _hidden in the tree, and the_ TOADS.


A BIG TOAD
[_Rearing himself in the grass._] We have come--[_Other_ TOADS _become
visible behind him._]

CHANTECLER
Ye gods, how ugly they are!

THE BIG TOAD
[_Obsequiously._]--in behalf of all the thinking contingency of the
Forest, to the author of so many songs--[_He places his hand on
his heart._]

CHANTECLER
[_With disgust._] Oh, that hand spread over his paunch!

THE BIG TOAD
[_With a hop toward_ CHANTECLER.]--at once novel,--

ANOTHER TOAD
[_Same business._] Pellucid!

ANOTHER
[_Same business._] Succinct!

ANOTHER
[_Same business._] Vital!

ANOTHER
[_Same business._] Pure!

ANOTHER
[_Same business._] Great!

CHANTECLER
Gentlemen, pray be seated. [_They seat themselves around a large
toadstool._]

THE BIG TOAD
True, we are ugly--

CHANTECLER
[_Politely._] You have fine eyes.

THE BIG TOAD
[_Raising himself by bearing with both hands upon the rim of the
toadstool._] But, Knights of this fungoid Round Table, we desire to do
homage to the Parsifal who has given to the world a sublime song--

SECOND TOAD
A true song!

THE BIG TOAD
And a celestial!

THIRD TOAD
And a no less terrestrial!

THE BIG TOAD
[_With authority._] A song by comparison with which the song of the
Nightingale sinks into insignificance!

CHANTECLER
[_Astonished._] The Nightingale's song?

SECOND TOAD
[_In a tone of finality._] Is not a circumstance to yours!

THE BIG TOAD
[_With a hop._] It was high time that a new singer--

ANOTHER
[_Same business._] And a new song--

FIFTH TOAD
[_Quickly, to his neighbour._] And a song by a stranger--

THE BIG TOAD
Came to change conditions here.

CHANTECLER
Ah, I shall change conditions?

ALL
Glory to the Cock!

CHANTECLER
I do not see that the forest thinks so poorly of me after all!

THE BIG TOAD
Played out, the Nightingale!

CHANTECLER
[_More and more surprised._] Really?

SECOND TOAD
More and more his song confesses itself effete--

THE BIG TOAD
Mawkish!

THIRD TOAD
Null!

FOURTH
[_Contemptuously._] And his old-fashioned pretense of inspiration!

FIFTH TOAD
And the name he has adopted: Bul-bul!

ALL THE TOADS
[_Puffing with laughter._] Bul-bul!

THE BIG TOAD
This is the way he goes on: [_Parodying the song of the_ NIGHTINGALE.]
Tio! Tio!

SECOND TOAD
His solitary idea is an old silver trill copied from the bubbling
spring. [_He imitates in grotesque fashion the singing of the_
NIGHTINGALE.] Tio! Tio!

CHANTECLER
But--

THE BIG TOAD
[_Quickly._] Do not attempt, you, the Renovator of Art, to defend that
ancient high authority on sentimental gargling!

SECOND TOAD
That superannuated tenor quavering out his cavatinas to the glory of
minor poetry and the edification of fogydom!

THIRD TOAD
The Harp that twanged through Tara's hall, and insists on twanging
still!

CHANTECLER
[_Indulgently._] But why should he not, after all, if he enjoys it?

THE BIG TOAD
Endeavouring to impose on a suffering and surfeited public the musty old
fashion of ingenious fioritura!

CHANTECLER
Audiences nowadays, of course, look for a different sort of thing.

THIRD TOAD
Your song has exposed the artificiality of his.

ALL
[_In an explosion._] Down with Bul-bul!

CHANTECLER
[_Whom the_ TOADS _have gradually surrounded._] Gentlemen and honored
Batrachians, my voice, it is true, gives forth natural notes--

THE BIG TOAD
Yes, notes which lend us wings--

CHANTECLER
[_Modestly._] Oh!

ALL
[_Waggling their bodies as if about to fly._] Wings!

THE BIG TOAD
Their secret being that they sing Life!

CHANTECLER
That is true.

SECOND TOAD
Yes, my dear fellow, Life!

CHANTECLER
[_With careless complacency._] My crest for that reason is flesh and blood!

ALL THE TOADS
[_Clapping their little hands._] Good, very good!

THE BIG TOAD
That formula is a programme.

SECOND TOAD
Since we are assembled around a table, why should we not offer to the
Chief--

CHANTECLER
[_Modestly, hanging back from the suggested honour._]Gentlemen--

SECOND TOAD
--to the Chief of whom we stood in notable need, a banquet?

ALL
[_Beating enthusiastically upon the toadstool._] A banquet!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Looking out from the tree._] What is the matter?

CHANTECLER
[_In spite of all, rather flattered._] A banquet!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Slightly ironical._] Shall you accept?

CHANTECLER
You see, my dear--the new tendencies--Art,--the thinking contingency of
the Forest--[_Indicating the_ TOADS.] Yes, I have lent wings to--[_In a
light and careless tone._] It's all up with the Nightingale, you see.
Musty old method! Antiquated trill! This is the way he goes on--[_To
the_ TOADS.] How was it you said he went on?

ALL THE TOADS
[_Comically._] Tio! Tio!

CHANTECLER
[_To the_ PHEASANT-HEN, _with pitying indulgence._] He goes on like
this: Tio! Tio! And I believe I need not scruple to accept--

A VOICE
[_In the tree above him breaks forth in a long note, limpid, and
heart-moving._] Tio! [_Silence._]

CHANTECLER
[_Startled, raising his head._] What was that?

THE BIG TOAD
[_Quickly, visibly embarrassed._] Nothing! It is he!

THE VOICE
[_Slowly and wonderfully, with the sigh of a soul in every note._] Tio!
Tio! Tio! Tio!

CHANTECLER
[_Turning upon the_ TOADS.] Scum of the earth!

THE TOADS
[_Backing away from him._] What--?



SCENE SIXTH

THE SAME, _the_ NIGHTINGALE _unseen, and little by little all the_
FOREST CREATURES.


THE NIGHTINGALE
[_From the tree, in his emotionally throbbing voice._] Tiny bird, lost
in the darkness of the tree, I feel myself turning into the heart-beat
of the infinite night!

CHANTECLER
[_To the_ TOADS.] And you have dared--

THE NIGHTINGALE
Hushed lies the ravine beneath the magic of the moon--

CHANTECLER
--to compare my rude singing with that divine voice? Scum of the earth!
Toads! And I never divined that they were doing to him here what was
done to me over yonder!

THE BIG TOAD
[_Suddenly swelling to a great size._] Toads! Yes, as it happens, we are
Toads!

THE NIGHTINGALE
Vapour of pearl wreathes the summits in an ethereal veil--

THE BIG TOAD
[_Self-appreciatively._] We are Toads, certainly, magnificently embossed
with warts! [_All rear themselves up, swollen, standing between_
CHANTECLER _and the tree._]

CHANTECLER
And I perceived not, I who have never known envy, to what venomous feast
I was bidden!

THE NIGHTINGALE
What matter? Sooner or later, you, the strong, and I, the tender, we
were fated, despite all the Toads in the world, to understand
each other!

CHANTECLER
[_With religious fervour._] Sing!

A TOAD
[_Who has hastily dragged himself to the tree in which the_ NIGHTINGALE
_is singing._] Let us clasp the bark with our slimy little arms, and
slaver upon the foot of the tree! [_All crawl toward the tree._]

CHANTECLER
[_Trying to stop one of them who is clumsily hopping._] But are you not
yourself gifted with a singing voice of exceptional purity?

THE TOAD
[_In a tone of sincerest suffering._] I am, but when I hear somebody
else singing, I can't help it,--I see green! [_He joins his
companions._]

THE BIG TOAD
[_Working his jaws as if chewing something which foamed._] There foam up
beneath our tongues I know not what strange soapsuds, and--[_To his
neighbour._] Are you frothing?

THE OTHER
I am frothing.

ANOTHER
He is frothing.

ALL
We are frothing.

A TOAD
[_Tenderly laying his arm about the neck of a dilatory_ TOAD.] Come and
froth!

CHANTECLER
[_To the_ NIGHTINGALE.] But will they not trouble and prevent your
mellifluent song?

THE NIGHTINGALE
In no wise. I will take their refrain into my song--

THE BIG TOAD
[_Patting a little_ TOAD _on the head to encourage him._] Don't be
afraid, go ahead,--froth!

THE TOADS
[_All together, at the base of the tree to which they form a crawling,
writhing girdle._] The Toads, croak! croak! the Toads are we!

THE NIGHTINGALE
--And make of both a Villanelle!

THE TOADS
We welter in malignity!

THE NIGHTINGALE
The while they fume beneath my tree I fill with song the enchanted dell--

THE TOADS
The Toads, croak! croak! the Toads are we! [_And the Villanelle
proceeds, sung by the alternate voices, one of which, ever higher and
more enraptured, carries the song proper, and the others, ever angrier
and lower, the burden of the song._]

THE NIGHTINGALE _and_ THE TOADS, _alternately_
  I sing! for Wind, that harper free,
  And music bubbling from the well--
  --We welter in malignity!--

  And fragrance floating from the lea,
  Of meadow-sweet and pimpernel--
  --The Toads, croak! croak! the Toads are we!--

  And Luna showering ecstasy,
  All weave so wonderful a spell--
  --We welter in malignity!--

  Its melting magic moveth me
  The secret of my heart to tell!
  --The Toads, croak! croak! the Toads are we!--

  Within my heart all sympathy,
  Within mine eye all visions dwell--
  --We welter in malignity!--

  Life, Death, I turn to rhapsody,
  Who am the deathless Philomel!
  --The Toads, croak! croak! the Toads are we,
  Who welter in malignity!

CHANTECLER
Beside those heavenly pipes, ah, me! my voice is Punchinello's squeak!
Sing on! Sing on! The Croakers are in retreat.

THE TOADS
[_Retreating, overcome by the conquering song._] Croak! croak!

CHANTECLER
Their fate to seethe in the cauldron of a witch! But you, the creatures
of the forest come to slake the thirst of their hearts at your song. See
them creeping to the lure--

THE TOADS
[_From the underbrush._] Croak! croak!

CHANTECLER
A doe, look! tiptoeing on delicate hoofs, followed by a wolf who has
forgotten to be a wolf--

THE TOADS
[_Lost among the grass._] Croak!

CHANTECLER
The squirrel steals down from the lofty tree-tops. The whole vast forest
is stirred by a thrill of brotherliness.

THE TOADS
[_Out of sight._]--roak!

CHANTECLER
The echo alone now repeats--

FAINT DISTANT VOICE
--oak!

CHANTECLER
Gone! Gone are the Toads!

[_Music holds the night: a song without words, delicate volleys of
rapturous notes._]

CHANTECLER
The Glow-worms have lighted their small, green lamps. All that is good
comes forth, while hate shrinks back to its lair. Now they that shall be
eaten lay themselves down in the grass by the side of them that shall
eat them. The Star of a sudden looks nearer to earth, and forsaking her
web the Spider draws herself up toward your song, climbing by her own
silken thread.

ALL THE FOREST
[_In a moan of ecstasy._] Ah!

[_And the forest lies as if under a spell; the moonlight is softer, the
tender green fire of the glow-worm shines blinking among the moss; on
all sides, between the tree-boles creep, shadow-like, the charmed
beasts; eyes shine, moist muzzles point toward the source of the music.
The_ WOODPECKER _stands at his bark window, dreamily nodding; all the_
RABBITS, _with uppricked ears, sit at their earthen doors._]

CHANTECLER
When he sings thus without words, what is he singing, Squirrel?

THE SQUIRREL
[_From a tree-top._] The joy of swift motion.

CHANTECLER
And what say you, Hare?

THE HARE
[_In the coppice._] The thrill of fear!

CHANTECLER
You, Rabbit?

ONE OF THE RABBITS
The Dew!

CHANTECLER
You, Doe?

THE DOE
[_From the depths of the woods._] Tears!

CHANTECLER
Wolf?

THE WOLF
[_In a gentle distant howl._] The Moon!

CHANTECLER
And you, Tree with the golden wound, singing Pine?

THE PINE-TREE
[_Softly beating time with one of its boughs._] He tells me that my
drops of resin in the form of rosin will sing upon the bows of violins!

CHANTECLER
And you, Woodpecker, what does he say to you?

THE WOODPECKER
[_In ecstasy._] He says that Aristophanes--

CHANTECLER
[_Promptly interrupting him._] Never mind! I know! You, Spider?

THE SPIDER
[_Swinging at the end of one of her threads._] He sings of the raindrop
sparkling in my web like a royal gift.

CHANTECLER
And you, Drop of Water, sparkling in her web?

A LITTLE VOICE
[_From the cobweb._] Of the Glow-worm!

CHANTECLER
And you, Glow-worm?

A LITTLE VOICE
[_In the grass._]Of the Star!

CHANTECLER
And you, if one may so far presume as to question you, of what does he
sing to you, Star?

A VOICE
[_In the sky._] Of the Shepherd!

CHANTECLER
Ah, what fountain is it--

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Who is watching the horizon between the trees._] The darkness is
lightening.

CHANTECLER
What fountain, in which each finds water for his thirst? [_Listening
with greater attention._] To me he speaks of the Day, which arises and
shines at my song!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Aside._] And speaks of it so eloquently that for once you will forget it!

CHANTECLER
[_Noticing a_ BIRD _who having come a little way out of the thicket is
beatifically listening._] And how do you, Snipe, translate his poem?

THE SNIPE
I don't know. I only know I like it--It is sweet!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Who is not lured--she!--into forgetting to watch the
sky between the branches, aside._] The night is wearing
away!

CHANTECLER
[_To the_ NIGHTINGALE, _in a discouraged voice._] To sing! To sing! But
how, after hearing the faultless crystal of your note, can I ever be
satisfied again with the crude, brazen blare of mine?

THE NIGHTINGALE
But you must!

CHANTECLER
Shall I find it possible ever again to sing? My song, alas, must seem to
me always after this too brutal and too red!

THE NIGHTINGALE
I have sometimes thought that mine was too facile, perhaps, and too blue!

CHANTECLER
Oh, how can you humble yourself to make such a confession to me?

THE NIGHTINGALE
You fought for a friend of mine, the Rose! Learn, comrade, this
sorrowful and reassuring fact, that no one, Cock of the morning or
evening Nightingale, has quite the song of his dreams!

CHANTECLER
[_With passionate desire._] Oh, to be a sound that soothes and lulls!

THE NIGHTINGALE
To be a splendid call to duty!

CHANTECLER
I make nobody weep!

THE NIGHTINGALE
I awaken nobody! [_But after the expression of this regret, he continues
in an ever higher and more lyrical voice._] What matter? One must sing
on! Sing on, even while knowing that there are songs which he prefers to
his own song. One must sing,--sing,--sing,--until--[_A shot. A flash
from the thicket. Brief silence, then a small, tawny body drops at_
CHANTECLER'S _feet._]

CHANTECLER
[_Bending and looking._] The Nightingale!--The brutes! [_And without
noticing the vague, earliest tremour of daylight spreading through the
air, he cries in a sob._] Killed! And he had sung such a little, little
while! [_One or two feathers slowly flutter down._]

THE PHEASANT-HEN
His feathers!

CHANTECLER
[_Bending over the body which is shaken by a last throe._] Peace, little
poet!

[_Rustling of leaves and snapping of twigs; from a thicket projects_
PATOU'S _shaggy head._]



SCENE SEVENTH

_The same_, PATOU, _emerging for a moment from the brush._


CHANTECLER
[_To_ PATOU.] You! [_Reproachfully._] You have come to get him?

PATOU
[_Ashamed._] Forgive me! The poacher compels me--

CHANTECLER
[_Who had sprung before the body, to protect it, uncovers it._] A
Nightingale!

PATOU
[_Hanging his head._] Yes. The evil race of man loves to shower lead
into a singing tree.

CHANTECLER
See, the burying beetle has already come.

PATOU
[_Gently withdrawing._] I will make believe I found nothing.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Watching the day break._] He has not noticed that night is nearly over.

CHANTECLER
[_Bending over the grasses which begin to stir about the dead bird._]
Insect, where the body has fallen, be swift to come and open the earth.
The funereal necrophaga are the only grave-diggers who never carry the
dead elsewhere, believing that the least sad, and the most fitting tomb,
is the very clay whereon one fell into the final sleep. [_To the funeral
insects, while the_ NIGHTINGALE _begins gently to sink into the
ground._] Piously dig his grave! Light lie the earth upon him!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Aside, looking at the horizon._] Over there--

CHANTECLER
Verily, verily, I say unto you, Bul-bul to-night shall see the Bird of
Paradise!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Aside._] The sky is turning white! [_A whistle is heard in the
distance._]

PATOU
[_To_ CHANTECLER.] I will come back. He is whistling me. [_Disappears._]

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Restlessly dividing her attention between the horizon and the_ COCK.]
How can I conceal from him--[_She moves tenderly toward_ CHANTECLER,
_opening her wings so as to hide the brightening East, and taking
advantage of his grief._] Come and weep beneath my wing! [_With a sob he
lays his head beneath the comforting wing which is quickly clapped over
him. And the_ PHEASANT-HEN _gently lulls him, murmuring._] You see that
my wing is soft and comforting! You see--

CHANTECLER
[_In a smothered voice._] Yes!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Gently rocks him, darting a glance now and then over her shoulder to
see how the dawn is progressing._] You see that a wing is an outspread
heart--[_Aside._] Day is breaking! [_To_ CHANTECLER.] You see
that--[_Aside._] The sky has paled! [_To_ CHANTECLER.]--that a wing
is--[_Aside._] The tree is steeped in rosy light! [_To_
CHANTECLER.]--partly a shield, and partly a cradle, partly a cloak and a
place of rest,--that a wing is a kiss which enfolds and covers you over.
You see that--[_With a backward leap, suddenly withdrawing her wings._]
the Day can break perfectly well without you!

CHANTECLER
[_With the greatest cry of anguish possible to created being._] Ah!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Continuing inexorably._] That the mosses in a moment will be scarlet!

CHANTECLER
[_Running toward the moss._] Ah, no! No! Not without me! [_The moss
flushes red._] Ungrateful!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
The horizon--

CHANTECLER
[_Imploringly, to the horizon._] No!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
--is glowing gold!

CHANTECLER
[_Staggering._] Treachery!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
One may be all in all to another heart, you see, one can be nothing to
the sky!

CHANTECLER
[_Swooning._] It is true!

PATOU
[_Returning, cheery and cordial._] Here I am! I have come to tell you
that they are all mad over there, at the topsy-turvy farm, to have back
the Cock who orders the return of Day!

CHANTECLER
They believe that now I have ceased to believe it!

PATOU
[_Stopping short, amazed._] What do you mean?

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Bitterly pressing close to_ CHANTECLER.] You see that a heart pressing
against your own is better than a sky which does not in the very
least need you.

CHANTECLER
Yes!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
That darkness after all may be as sweet as light if there are two
close-clasped in the shade.

CHANTECLER
[_Wildly._] Yes! Yes! [_But suddenly leaving her side he raises his head
and in a ringing voice._] Cock-a-doodle-doo!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Taken aback._] Why are you crowing?

CHANTECLER
As a warning to myself,--for thrice have I denied the thing I love!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
And what is that?

CHANTECLER
My life's work! [_To_ PATOU.] Up and about! Come, let us go!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
What are you going to do?

CHANTECLER
Follow my calling.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
But what night is there for you to rout?

CHANTECLER
The night of the eyelid!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Pointing toward the growing glory of the dawn._] Very well, you will
rouse sleepers--

CHANTECLER
And Saint Peter!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
But can you not see that Day has risen without the benefit of your crowing?

CHANTECLER
I am more sure of my destiny than of the daylight before my eyes.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Pointing at the_ NIGHTINGALE _who has already half disappeared into
the earth._] Your faith can no more return to life than can that
dead bird.

[_From the tree above their heads suddenly rings forth the
heart-stirring, limpid, characteristic note: Tio! Tio!_]

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Struck with amazement._] Is it another singing?

PATOU
[_With quivering ear._] And singing still better, if possible.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Looking up in a sort of terror at the foliage, and then down at the
little grave._] Another takes up the song when this one disappears?

THE VOICE
In the forest must always be a Nightingale!

CHANTECLER
[_With exaltation._] And in the soul a faith so faithful that it comes
back even after it has been slain.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
But if the Sun is climbing up the sky?

CHANTECLER
There must have been left in the air some power from my yesterday's song.

[_Flights of noiseless grey wings pass among the trees._]

THE OWLS
[_Hooting joyfully._] He kept still!

PATOU
[_Raising his head and looking after them._] The Owls, fleeing from the
newly risen light, are coming home to the woods.

THE OWLS
[_Returning to their holes in the old trees._] He kept still!

CHANTECLER
[_With all his strength come back to him._] The proof that I was serving
the cause of light when I sang is that the Owls are glad of my silence.
[_Going to the_ PHEASANT-HEN, _with defiance in his mien._] I make the
Dawn appear, and I do more than that!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Choking._] You do--

CHANTECLER
On grey mornings, when poor creatures waking in the twilight dare not
believe in the day, the bright copper of my song takes the place of the
sun! [_Turning to go._] Back to our work!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
But how find courage to work after doubting the work's value?

CHANTECLER
Buckle down to work!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_With angry stubbornness._] But if you have nothing whatever to do with
making the morning?

CHANTECLER
Then I am just the Cock of a remoter Sun! My cries so affect the night
that it lets certain beams of the day pierce through its black tent, and
those are what we call the stars. I shall not live to see shining upon
the steeples that final total light composed of stars clustered in
unbroken mass; but if I sing faithfully and sonorously and if, long
after me, and long after that, in every farmyard its Cock sings
faithfully, sonorously, I truly believe there will be no more night!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
When will that be?

CHANTECLER
One Day!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Go, go, and forget our forest!

CHANTECLER
No, I shall never forget the noble green forest where I learned that he
who has witnessed the death of his dream must either die at once or else
arise stronger than before.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_In a voice which she does her best to make insulting._] Go and get
into your hen-house by the way of a ladder.

CHANTECLER
The birds have taught me that I can use my wings to go in.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Go and see your old Hen in her old broken basket.

CHANTECLER
Ah, forest of the Toads, forest of the Poacher, forest of the
Nightingale, and of the Pheasant-hen, when my old peasant mother sees me
home again, back from your green recesses where pain is so interwoven
with love, what will she say?

PATOU
[_Imitating the_ OLD HEN'S _affectionate quaver._] How that Chick has
grown!

CHANTECLER
[_Emphatically._] Of course she will! [_Turning to leave._]

THE PHEASANT-HEN
He is going! When faithless they turn to leave, oh, that we had arms,
arms to hold them fast,--but we have only wings!

CHANTECLER
[_Stops short and looks at her, troubled._] She weeps?

PATOU
[_Hastily, pushing him along with his paw._] Hurry up!

CHANTECLER
[_To_ PATOU.] Wait a moment.

PATOU
I am willing. Nothing can sit so patiently and watch the dropping of
tears as an old dog.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Crying to_ CHANTECLER, _with a leap toward him._] Take me with you!

CHANTECLER
[_Turns and in an inflexible voice._] Will you consent to stand second
to the Dawn?

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Fiercely drawing back._] Never!

CHANTECLER
Then farewell!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
I hate you!

CHANTECLER
[_Already at some distance among the brush._] I love you, but I should
poorly serve the work to which I devote myself anew at the side of one
to whom it were less than the greatest thing in the world! [_He
disappears._]



SCENE EIGHTH

THE PHEASANT-HEN, PATOU, _later the_ WOODPECKER, RABBITS, _and, all the_
VOICES _of the awakening forest._


PATOU
[_To the_ PHEASANT-HEN.] Mourn!

THE SPIDER
[_In the centre of her-web which now sifts the gold dust of a sunbeam._]
  Spider at morn,
  Cometh to warn!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Furiously, tearing down the cobweb with a brush of her wing._] Be
still, hateful Spider!--Oh, may he perish for having disdained me!

THE WOODPECKER
[_Who from his window has been watching_ CHANTECLER'S _departure,
suddenly, frightened._] The poacher has seen him!

THE OWLS
[_In the trees._] The Cock is in danger!

THE WOODPECKER
[_Leaning out to see better._] He breaks his gun in two!

PATOU
[_Alarmed._] To load it! Is that murderous fool in sheepskin gaiters
going to fire upon a rooster?

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Spreading her wings to rise._] Not if he sees a pheasant!

PATOU
[_Springing before her._] What are you doing?

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Following my calling! [_She flies toward the danger._]

THE WOODPECKER
[_Seeing that in her upward swing she must touch the spring of the
forgotten snare._] Look out for the snare! [_Too late. The net falls._]

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Utters a cry of despair._] Ah!

PATOU
She is caught!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Struggling in the net._] He is lost!

PATOU
[_Wildly._] She is--He is--

[_All the_ RABBITS _have thrust out their heads to see._]

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Crying in an ardent prayer._] Daybreak protect him!

THE OWLS
[_Rocking themselves gleefully among the branches._] The gun-barrel
shines, shines--

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Dawn, touch the cartridge with your dewy wing! Trip the foot of the
hunter in a tangle of grass! He is your Cock! He drove off the darkness
and the shadow of the Hawk! And he is going to die. Nightingale, you,
say something! Speak!

THE NIGHTINGALE
[_In a supplicating sob._] He fought for a friend of mine, the Rose!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Let him live! And I will dwell in the farmyard beside the ploughshare
and the hoe! And renouncing for his sake all that in my pride I made a
burden and torment to him, I will own, O Sun, that when you made his
shadow you marked out my place in the world!

[_Daylight grows. On all sides, rustles and murmurs._]

THE WOODPECKER
[_Singing._] The air is blue!

A CROW
[_Cawing as he flies past._] Daylight grows!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
The forest is astir--

ALL THE BIRDS
[_Waking among the trees._] Good-morning! Good-morning! Good-morning!
Good-morning! Good-morning!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Everyone sings!

A JAY
[_Darting past like a streak of blue lightning._] Ha, ha!

THE WOODPECKER
The Jay shakes with homeric laughter.

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Crying in the midst of the music of the morning._] Let him live!

THE JAY
[_Again darting past._] Ha, ha!

A CUCKOO
[_In the distance._] Cuckoo!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
I abdicate!

PATOU
[_Lifting his eyes heavenward._] She abdicates!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
Forgive, O Light, to whom I dared dispute him! Dazzle the eye taking
aim, and be victory awarded, O Sunbeams--

THE JAY _and the_ CUCKOO
[_Far away._] Ha! Cuckoo!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
--to your powder of gold--[_A shot. She gives a sharp cry, ending in a
dying voice._]--over man's black powder! [_Silence._]

CHANTECLER'S VOICE
[_Very far away._] Cock-a-doodle-doo!

ALL
[_In a glad cry._] Saved!

THE RABBITS
[_Capering gaily out of their burrows._] Let us turn somersets among the
thyme!

A VOICE
[_Fresh and solemn, among the trees._] O God of birds!

THE RABBITS
[_Stopping short in their antics stand abruptly still; soberly._] The
morning prayer!

THE WOODPECKER
[_Crying to the_ PHEASANT-HEN.] They are coming to examine the trap!

THE PHEASANT-HEN
[_Closes her eyes in resignation._] So be it!

THE VOICE IN THE TREES
God by whose grace we wake to this new day--

PATOU
[_Before leaving._] Hush! Drop the curtain! Men folk are coming! [_Off._]

[_All the woodland creatures hide. The_ PHEASANT-HEN _is left alone,
and, held down by the snare, with spread wings and panting breast,
awaits the approach of the giant._]

          It nods o'er chisel, brush and loom,
          And consecrates the poet's strain.

                                _ACT I._

            A PERFORMANCE AT THE HOTEL DE BOURGOGNE THEATRE.


_The interior of the Hotel de Bourgogne Theatre, in 1640. A sort of
Racket-Court arranged and decorated in view of performances. The
auditorium is a long square. It runs diagonally, and forms the
background, one of its sides beginning at first entrance, right, and
ending at last entrance, left, where it forms a right angle with the
stage, that is thus seen canted. On each side of this stage, benches
along the wings. The curtain is in two pieces of tapestry, that can be
drawn apart. Above the proscenium, the royal arms. Wide steps lead from
the stage to the auditorium. On either side of these steps, seats for
the violin-players. Foot-lights composed of candles._

_Two galleries, one above the other, running along the side of the
auditorium (that forms the diagonal background). The upper gallery is
divided into boxes. No seats in the pit. In the rear of this pit, really
front first entrance right, a few benches in tiers. Under a staircase
leading to the galleries, and only the lower part of which can be seen,
a refreshment side-board bearing lights, flowers, glasses, plates of
cakes, decanters, etc._

_In the rear, centre, under the galleries, the entrance to the house. A
wide door, half opened now and then to admit the audience. Near this
door, as well as near the side-board and in other places, red posters
giving the name of the play about to be performed: "La Clorise."_

_As the curtain rises, the house is empty and rather dark._

_The chandeliers have been lowered into the pit, but are not yet
lighted._


                               _SCENE I._

_The audience enters gradually. Gentlemen, tradesmen, lackeys, pages,
pickpockets, the janitor, etc._ THE MARQUISES, CUIGY, BRISSAILLE, _the
waiting girl, the violins, etc._

_Noise outside the door, then a gentleman bursts in._

                     THE JANITOR (_pursuing him_).

Here! Your fifteen sols!

                             THE GENTLEMAN.

I pay nothing for admission.

                              THE JANITOR.

Why so?

                             THE GENTLEMAN.

King's guard!

           THE JANITOR (_to another gentleman just come in_).

You, Sir?

                           SECOND GENTLEMAN.

Free admission.

                              THE JANITOR.

But ....

                           SECOND GENTLEMAN.

Musketeer!

                FIRST GENTLEMAN (_to second gentleman_).

It's not two o'clock yet, and the pit is empty. Suppose we fence a bit?

     (_They begin fencing with foils they have brought along._)

                         A LACKEY (_entering_).

Pst----Flanquin!

                      ANOTHER LACKEY (_just in_).

Hallo, Champagne!

      FIRST LACKEY (_taking cards and dice from out his doublet_).

Cards? Dice? Let's play.

     (_Seats himself on the floor._)

                             SECOND LACKEY.

Certainly, you rascal.

     (_Takes a candle out of his pocket, lights it, and after seating
     himself near first lackey, plants it on the floor._)

               GUARD (_taking flower-girl by the waist_).

How sweet in you to come before the lights do!

                          ONE OF THE FENCERS.

Touched!

                        ONE OF THE CARD-PLAYERS.

Clubs!

               GUARD (_to flower-girl trying to escape_).

A kiss!

      A MAN (_sitting on the floor, with a basket of provisions_).

I come early, so as to eat in peace. A knowing fellow, when he is at the
Hôtel de Bourgogne, should drink his Burgundy. (_Drinks._)

                       TRADESMAN (_to his son_).

  It's as bad as a low tavern.--(_Showing the man drinking_):
  Drunkards!--(_One of the fencers backs up against him_):
  Cut throats!--(_He is pushed on to the card-players_):
  Gamblers!

               GUARD (_still pursuing the flower-girl_).

A kiss!

                       TRADESMAN (_hearing him_).

And worse!--For shame! To think that walls like these, my son, have seen
the plays of Rotrou!

                                THE SON.

And Corneille's!

           A TROOP OF PAGES (_coming in, dancing and singing,
                  holding each other by the hand, so as to
                  form a string_).

Tra la la la la la la la la la la lère!....

                     JANITOR (_to Pages severely_).

No practical jokes, mind!

                   FIRST PAGE (_with great dignity_).

Sir, your suspicion is an offense!....

                     SECOND PAGE (_to first Page_).

I have some string. Haven't you a fish-hook?

                              FIRST PAGE.

Of course I have! We can do some fine angling from up stairs.

     (_To the other Pages who are already in the gallery_).

We're coming!

                       THIRD PAGE (_in gallery_).

We're ready! (_Blows dried peas at him through hollow stick._)

                 A PICKPOCKET (_drawing around him some
                        suspicious-looking characters_).

Now, youngsters, try to learn something. You see, the first time you
steal....

     (_Driven away by dried peas blown in showers by the Pages above._)

                       TRADESMAN (_to his son_).

The play we are going to see: "La Clorise" ....

                                  SON.

The author, please?

                               TRADESMAN.

Balthazar Baro.

              PICKPOCKET (_continuing his instructions_).

Mind the lace around the knees![2] How you cut it!

                       TRADESMAN (_to his son_).

I was at the first performance of "Le Cid,"--(_pointing up_)--There!

                              PICKPOCKET.

As to watches.... and kerchiefs....

                               TRADESMAN.

You are going, my son, to see illustrious actors. (_Enumerating_)
Montfleury!

                               THE PAGES.

Light the chandeliers!

              WAITING-GIRL (_offering her refreshments_).

Oranges! Milk! Raspberry water! Cedar water!

                        A MARQUIS (_entering_).

Make way there, fellows!

                               A LACKEY.

What! a Marquis in the pit!

        MARQUIS (_to other Marquises who have followed him in_).

The house is empty! Why, we enter like tradesmen, disturbing nobody,
treading on nobody's toes! Disgraceful!

     (_Meeting other noblemen just come in_).

Cuigy! Brissaille!

     (_They salute and embrace each other with great affectation._)

                                 CUIGY.

Patrons of art so faithful, yes, that we get here even before the
candles are lighted!

                                MARQUIS.

Do not mention it! I'm terribly out of humour!

                  CUIGY (_seeing lamplighter enter_).

Be consoled! Here is the lamplighter.

                      ALL THE HOUSE (_satisfied_).

Ah....

     (_Groups around the chandeliers while they are being lighted.
     Lignière enters the pit, leaning on the arm of Christian de
     Neuvillette. Lignière, somewhat untidy, has the appearance of a
     gentlemanly drunkard. Christian, dressed with care, but somewhat
     out of fashion, seems thoughtful, and examines the boxes._)

                              _SCENE II._

    _The same_, CHRISTIAN, LIGNIÈRE, _then_ RAGUENEAU _and_ LE BRET.

                                 CUIGY.

Why, here's Lignière!

                        BRISSAILLE (_laughing_).

And not yet drunk?....

                    LIGNIÈRE (_aside to Christian_).

Shall I present you?

          (_Christian nods assent. Lignière presents._)

                    Baron de Neuvillette.

                              (_General salutations._)

           THE AUDIENCE (_as the first chandelier goes up_).

Ah!....

             CUIGY (_to Brissaille, looking at Christian_).

A beautiful head!

                  FIRST MARQUIS (_who has overheard_).

Oh! so, so!....

                 LIGNIÈRE (_presenting to Christian_).

Mr. de Cuigy, Mr. de Brissaille.

                         CHRISTIAN (_bowing_).

Delighted!

                      FIRST MARQUIS (_to second_).

He is good looking, but not dressed according to the latest fashion.

                         LIGNIÈRE (_to Cuigy_).

Baron de Neuvillette has just arrived from Touraine.

                               CHRISTIAN.

Yes, I've been in Paris only a few days. To-morrow I join the guards,
the Cadets.

               FIRST MARQUIS (_looking up to the boxes_).

There is the wife of President Aubry.

                           THE WAITING-GIRL.

Oranges, milk ....

                        THE VIOLINS (_tuning_).

La, la, la, la, la.

                CUIGY (_to Christian, looking around_).

Quite an assemblage!

                               CHRISTIAN.

Yes, indeed!

                             FIRST MARQUIS.

The cream of fashion.

     (_He seems to give the names of the different ladies who occupy the
     boxes, in full dress. Bows, nods, answers, smiles._)

                            SECOND MARQUIS.

Mesdames de Guéménée....

                                 CUIGY.

De Bois-Dauphin....

                             FIRST MARQUIS.

Whom we loved ....

                              BRISSAILLE.

De Chavigny ....

                            SECOND MARQUIS.

For whom our hearts are toys!

                               LIGNIÈRE.

There is Monsieur de Corneille, just from Rouen.

                   TRADESMAN'S SON (_to his father_).

The Academy is here?....

                               TRADESMAN.

I see several of its members. Here are Boudu, Boissat, Cureau de la
Chambre, Porchères, Colomby, Bourzeys, Bourdon, Arbaud .... So many
names that can never die! How grand!

                             FIRST MARQUIS.

Attention! here are our lovely "précieuses,"[3] they of wondrous names:
Barthénoïde, Urimédonte, Cassandace, Félixérie ....

                            SECOND MARQUIS.

Delightful names! Marquis, you know them all?

                             FIRST MARQUIS.

I know them all, Marquis.

                    LIGNIÈRE (_aside to Christian_).

I came in to do you service. The lady comes not. So I return to my
tavern.

                       CHRISTIAN (_imploringly_).

Do not. You, who in your songs depict both town and court, can tell me
the name of one for whom I am dying of love. Remain!

                     (_The violins begin to play._)

I fear she may be something of a coquette and too subtle in her
refinement. I dare not speak to her, for my wit is dull and the language
of to-day confuses me. I am but a good soldier. She generally occupies
that box to the right--that empty one.

                      LIGNIÈRE (_as if to leave_).

I must go.

                       CHRISTIAN (_holding him_).

Remain, please.

                               LIGNIÈRE.

I cannot. D'Assoucy expects me at the tavern. One might die of thirst
here.

                       WAITING-GIRL (_passing_).

Lemonade!

                               LIGNIÈRE.

Fie!

                             WAITING-GIRL.

Milk!

                               LIGNIÈRE.

Ugh!

                             WAITING-GIRL.

Wine!

                               LIGNIÈRE.

(_to Christian_).                 (_to waiting-girl_).

I'll stay a while.                Let me taste your wine.

     (_Takes a seat near the buffet. Waiting-girl serves wine to him._)

             SHOUTS IN THE AUDIENCE (_on the entrance of a
                  short, plump and jovial looking man_).

Here's Ragueneau!

                       LIGNIÈRE (_to Christian_).

The celebrated poulterer and pastry-cook!

           RAGUENEAU (_in his best pastry-cook clothes, going
                  up to Lignière_).

Sir, have you seen Monsieur de Cyrano?

            LIGNIÈRE (_presenting Ragueneau to Christian_).

The caterer of comedians and poets!

                       RAGUENEAU (_bowing low_).

Flattered, indeed!....

                               LIGNIÈRE.

Come, come, you Mæcenas!

                               RAGUENEAU.

They honour me with their custom ....

                               LIGNIÈRE.

But seldom pay. A good poet himself ....

                               RAGUENEAU.

They say so.

                               LIGNIÈRE.

Enthusiastic for verse!

                               RAGUENEAU.

The fact is that for a short poem ....

                               LIGNIÈRE.

You willingly give a pie.

                               RAGUENEAU.

A small tart only!

                               LIGNIÈRE.

Good fellow, he excuses himself!.... And for a triolet did you not give
....

                               RAGUENEAU.

Only a few rolls!

                         LIGNIÈRE (_sternly_).

Milk-rolls!.... And the stage? You like it?

                               RAGUENEAU.

I love it.

                               LIGNIÈRE.

And you buy your way in with your cakes.

                               RAGUENEAU.

Oh, so few! (_Looking around._) But I am surprised not to see Monsieur
de Cyrano!

                               LIGNIÈRE.

Why so?

                               RAGUENEAU.

Because Montfleury plays!

                               LIGNIÈRE.

That talking hogshead? True. To-night he plays Phédon. But what cares
Cyrano?

                               RAGUENEAU.

Don't you know? Monsieur de Cyrano has taken an aversion for him, and,
gentlemen, has forbidden him to appear on the stage for a whole month.

                LIGNIÈRE (_emptying his fourth glass_).

Well, then?

                               RAGUENEAU.

Oh! I only came to see what is going to happen.

        FIRST MARQUIS (_who has come up meanwhile with Cuigy_).

Who is this Cyrano?

                                 CUIGY.

A capital swordsman.

                            SECOND MARQUIS.

Of noble birth?

                                 CUIGY.

Sufficiently so. He is a cadet in the guards.

     (_Indicating a gentleman who appears to be seeking somebody._)

But here's his friend Le Bret....

     (_Calling_) Le Bret! (_Le Bret comes down._)

You are looking for Bergerac?

                                LE BRET.

Yes, and with some anxiety....

                                 CUIGY.

Am I not right in stating that he is no ordinary man?

                           LE BRET (_moved_).

He is the most exquisite of creatures sublunary.

                               RAGUENEAU.

A rimester!

                                 CUIGY.

A swordsman!

                              BRISSAILLE.

A scientist!

                                LE BRET.

A musician!

                               LIGNIÈRE.

But how strange is his appearance!

                               RAGUENEAU.

No solemn painter, like Philip de Champaigne, probably, will ever give
us a portrait of him. But he is so odd, extravagant, wild and strange,
that he could well have served Jacques Callot as a model for the most
erratic of his fighting heroes. Three-plumed hat, astounding doublet,
cloak whose folds a sword draws up behind, in stateliness, like the
saucy tail of a cock.[4] Prouder than the proudest of Gascony's
numberless haughty sons, he wears, above his Pulcinella ruff, a
nose!.... Ah! mylords, what a nose is that nose! It is impossible, in
presence of such a nose-bearer[5] not to think: "This, really, is
exaggeration!" Then you will smile, and think: "Of course, he'll take it
off." But Monsieur de Bergerac never takes it off.

                                LE BRET.

Never--but whoever notices that nose he wears is sure to get a
swordthrust for the attention.

                               RAGUENEAU.

His sword is one of the two blades of the fatal sisters' scissors!

               FIRST MARQUIS (_shrugging his shoulders_).

He will not come.

                               RAGUENEAU.

Oh! yes, he will. I'll bet.... a chicken....à la Ragueneau.

     (_Murmurs of admiration as Roxane appears in her box, where she
     takes a seat in front, while her duenna sits behind her. Christian,
     busy paying the waiter-girl, does not notice her entrance._)

                     SECOND MARQUIS (_affectedly_).

Oh! gentlemen, she is frightfully lovely!

                             FIRST MARQUIS.

A peach divine, smiling in a nest of strawberries.[6]

                            SECOND MARQUIS.

So refreshing that she might give one a cold in the heart!

              CHRISTIAN (_perceiving Roxane, and clutching
                  Lignière's arm_).

It's she!

                        LIGNIÈRE (_looking up_).

So this is your deity!

                               CHRISTIAN.

Yes, speak quickly. I tremble.

                 LIGNIÈRE (_slowly sipping his wine_).

Magdeleine Robin, otherwise Roxane. Refined and quick. A "précieuse."

                               CHRISTIAN.

Alas!

                               LIGNIÈRE.

Independent. An orphan. Cousin of Cyrano, whom you heard mentioned just
now.

     (_A gentleman, very finely dressed, wearing a blue ribbon crosswise
     from shoulder to waist, enters the box, and remains engaged in
     conversation with Roxane._)

                        CHRISTIAN (_starting_).

That man?....

              LIGNIÈRE (_slightly intoxicated, winking_).

Ha, ha! The Count de Guiche. Very much in love with her. But he is the
husband of Richelieu's niece. And he is urging Roxane to marry rather a
sorry fellow, Monsieur de Valvert, who is both of noble birth and....
accommodating. She resists, but Guiche has influence. I wrote a song on
the subject. No doubt he bears me a grudge for it. The end is cutting.
Just listen:

     (_He rises, holding up his glass, ready to sing._)

                               CHRISTIAN.

No, stop.--I must leave.

                               LIGNIÈRE.

And you are going?....

                               CHRISTIAN.

To seek this Valvert.

                               LIGNIÈRE.

Take care. Perhaps it's he that might kill you. (_Indicating Roxane._)
See! she is looking at you.

                               CHRISTIAN.

True. (_He remains, looking up as if transfixed. The pickpockets get
close around him._)

                               LIGNIÈRE.

'Tis I who leave. I'm thirsty and I must be expected--in some tavern!

     (_Exit unsteadily._)

            LE BRET (_who has been walking, to Ragueneau_).

I feel relieved. Cyrano has not come.

                       RAGUENEAU (_incredulous_).

I'd be astonished....

                             THE AUDIENCE.

The play! The play! The play!

  [3] Query.--Might it not be argued that the "précieuses" were perhaps
      spiritual daughters of the _euphuists_, disciples of John Lyly,
      who flourished in England under Queen Elizabeth, about half a
      century before the time of action here?

  [4] Note.--Not "an insolent cocktail," as one translation has it.

  [5] Note.--Literal translation of "nasigère," a word invented by
      Ragueneau, would be euphuist.

  [6] Note.--The play on the word "fraise" (both "strawberry" and
      "ruff") could not be reproduced.


                              _SCENE III._

    _The same, except_ LIGNIÈRE; GUICHE, VALVERT, _then_ MONTFLEURY.

              SECOND MARQUIS (_seeing Guiche, as he comes
                   from Roxane's box, crossing the pit,
                   surrounded with fawning friends, among
                   whom Valvert_).

Guiche! Ff! Another Gascon!

                             FIRST MARQUIS.

Yes, of the cool and supple breed, the one that thrives. We had better
greet him, believe me.

     (_Both go up to meet Guiche. General salutations._)

                            SECOND MARQUIS.

Beautiful ribbons! What colour, Count? "Kiss-me-darling," or
"roe's-breast?"

                                GUICHE.

Colour? "Sickly-Spaniard."

                             FIRST MARQUIS.

The colour is fast and true; for soon, thanks to your valor, the
Spaniard will be worse than uneasy in Flanders!

                                GUICHE.

I am going to my seat on the stage. Are you coming?

     (_He and his followers walk up on to the stage. Guiche turns and
     calls._)

Come along, Valvert!

                 CHRISTIAN (_who has heard, starting_).

That viscount! Now I'll fling at him!....

     (_Puts his hand to his pocket and finds there the hand of a
     thief._)

     (_holding on to the pickpocket_).

I was looking for a glove!

                        PICKPOCKET (_smiling_).

And you find a hand. (_Aside and rapidly._) Let me go and I'll tell you
a secret.

                    CHRISTIAN (_still holding him_).

What secret?

                              PICKPOCKET.

Lignière, who has just left you, is going to his death. A song of his
gave offence to.... some great man, and one hundred men, I know it, will
lie in wait for him to-night....

                    CHRISTIAN (_still holding on_).

One hundred! Paid by whom?

                              PICKPOCKET.

Discretion....

                 CHRISTIAN (_shrugging his shoulders_).

Oh!

                   PICKPOCKET (_with great dignity_).

Professional discretion....

                               CHRISTIAN.

Where?

                              PICKPOCKET.

At the Porte de Nesle, his way home. Warn him in time.

                 CHRISTIAN (_freeing the pickpocket_).

Where can I find Lignière?

                              PICKPOCKET.

In one of the taverns near here: "The Golden Wine-Press," "The
Fir-Cone," "The Bursting-Belt," "The Two Torches," "The Three Funnels."
Go the rounds and leave a note in each.

                               CHRISTIAN.

I'll do it! The wretches! A hundred men against one! (_Looking up toward
Roxane._) But to leave her! (_With a look of fury toward Valvert._) And
him! But I must save Lignière!

     (_He rushes out. Guiche and his followers have gone on to the stage
     behind the curtain, to take their seats. The pit is full; so are
     the galleries and boxes._)

                             THE AUDIENCE.

The play! The play! Curtain!

              TRADESMAN (_whose wig flies up hooked by one
                   of the pages above_).

My wig! (_Shaking his fist at the pages._) Scoundrels!

     (_All the audience laughs. Sudden silence._)

                        LE BRET (_astonished_).

What is it?

                      TRADESMAN (_near Le Bret_).

The Cardinal.... there.... in a screened box.

                                A PAGE.

Good-bye, fun! (_Raps on the stage. Order in the audience. Wait._)

           A MARQUIS (_behind the curtain, during silence_).

Snuff that candle!

            OTHER MARQUIS (_passing through the split in the
                  curtain_).

A chair, please!

     (_A chair is passed, from hand to hand, over the heads of the
     audience. The marquis takes it and disappears behind the curtain,
     after sending a few kisses up into the boxes._)

     (_Three raps on the stage. Curtain is drawn aside. Tableau.
     Marquises seated on either side of the stage, in impertinent
     attitudes. Drop represents a bluish pastoral scene. Low music by
     the violins._)

                    LE BRET (_aside to Ragueneau_).

Montfleury comes in at once, does he not?

                    RAGUENEAU (_aside to Le Bret_).

Yes. Monsieur de Cyrano is not here, and I have lost my bet.

                                LE BRET.

I am glad of it.

     (_A bag-pipe air, and Montfleury appears, a very powerful man in a
     poetic shepherd's dress: his hat ornamented with roses and his
     bag-pipe with ribbons._)

                        THE PIT (_applauding_).

Bravo, Montfleury! Montfleury!

        MONTFLEURY (_after bowing, begins his part of Phédon_).

  "Oh! happy he who far from courts, in solitude,[7]
  Self-banished, has cast off the chains of servitude,
  And who, when zephyr sighs and rustles through the leaves...."

                          A VOICE IN THE PIT.

You rascal, did I not suspend you for a month?

     (_Astonishment. Everybody eager to see who spoke. Murmurs._)

                        SEVERAL OF THE AUDIENCE.

What? What is it? Who? Why?

     (_People in the boxes rise, to see better._)

                                 CUIGY.

It's he!

                        LE BRET (_frightened_).

Cyrano!

                         THE VOICE IN THE PIT.

King of clowns, get off the stage!

                               THE HOUSE.

Oh!

                              MONTFLEURY.

But....

                         THE VOICE IN THE PIT.

You recalcitrate?[8]

                VOICES IN THE PIT (_and in the boxes_).

Silence! Enough! Go on, Montfleury! Montfleury, have no fear!....

                    MONTFLEURY (_in shaking tone_).

"Oh! happy he who far from courts, in sol...."

               THE VOICE IN THE PIT (_more threatening_).

Well, you king of knaves, shall I be forced to plant a grove of these
upon your shoulders?

     (_A stick is seen to rise in the pit._)

                 MONTFLEURY (_in still weaker tones_).

"Oh! happy he...."

     (_The stick is shaken threateningly._)

                         THE VOICE IN THE PIT.

Get off, I say!

                                THE PIT.

Oh!

                   MONTFLEURY (_almost breathless_).

"Oh! happy he who far ...."

            CYRANO (_in the pit, standing on his chair, arms
                folded, hat cocked on the side of his head,
                his mustache bristling and his nose terrible_).

I am going to let my temper loose!

     (_Excitement in the audience._)

  [7] Note.--Alexandrine verse adopted here and further on (beginning
      of Act II) as being more pompous.

  [8] Note.--The words "you kick," in the place of "tu récalcitres,"
      were suggested by a friend, as a better translation. But the good
      critic failed to realise that Cyrano does not use slang, and is
      almost always, on the contrary, somewhat hyperbolic, addicted to
      willful oddity of speech.--"Récalcitrant," adj.-part. (doggedly
      resisting), is frequently used in French. But the infinitive
      "récalcitrer," though it exists, and the other forms of the verb
      are seldom, if ever, heard.--Cyrano, therefore, calls up a smile,
      if not a laugh, by resorting to the verb in the second person,
      singular, present, indicative.--_To recalcitrate_ is a good
      English word (see Longfellow), but it is so seldom used that it
      creates on the English ear the same impression of amused surprise
      that is induced by the original.


                              _SCENE IV._

             _The same_, CYRANO, _then_ BELLEROSE, JODELET.

                    MONTFLEURY (_to the Marquises_).

Protect me, gentlemen!

                        A MARQUIS (_languidly_).

Play on! Play on!

                                CYRANO.

Now mind me, corpulence! If you play, I'll have to spank your cheeks.

                              THE MARQUIS.

Enough! Enough!

                                CYRANO.

Let the gentlemen remain silent on their benches. Otherwise their
ribbons will have a taste of my stick.

                     ALL THE MARQUISES (_rising_).

This is too much, indeed! Montfleury!

                                CYRANO.

Montfleury must go, or I shall crop his ears and disembowel him!

                                A VOICE.

But ....

                                CYRANO.

He must go!

                             ANOTHER VOICE.

We cannot ....

                                CYRANO.

What! Not gone yet!

     (_As if he were going to turn up his sleeves_). Then must I go upon
     the stage to cut up this overgrown sausage into slices?

               MONTFLEURY (_with an attempt at dignity_).

By insulting me, Sir, you insult the Muse Thalia!

                    CYRANO (_with great courtesy_).

If the Muse Thalia, with whom you are not related, Sir, had the honour
of your acquaintance and saw you so fat and so silly, she would
certainly give you a lift with her buskin.

                                THE PIT.

Montfleury! Montfleury! The play.

                CYRANO (_to the noisy ones around him_).

Have pity on my scabbard! If you continue thus, it will lose control of
its blade.

     (_The circle around him widens._)

                                                      (_to Montfleury_).

Get off the stage!

     (_The crowd closes in on him, muttering._)

                                                   (_Turning suddenly_).

Any objection made?

     (_Crowd falls back again._)

                        A VOICE (_in the rear_).

Monsieur de Cyrano is a tyrant. "La Clorise" shall be played.

                             THE AUDIENCE.

"La Clorise!" "La Clorise!"

                                CYRANO.

If I hear that again, I'll slaughter you all.

                               TRADESMAN.

You are not Samson!

                                CYRANO.

I will be, my dear Sir, if you'll lend me your jaw.

                    A LADY (_in one of the boxes_).

Disgraceful disturbance!

                              A GENTLEMAN.

Scandalous!

                                A PAGE.

Oh! What fun!

                                THE PIT.

Kss! Kss! Montfleury! Cyrano!

                                CYRANO.

Silence! Such is my order. I challenge the whole pit! Now for the names!
Come up here, young heroes. Take the line, please; I'll distribute
numbers. Well, who'll be number one? You, Sir? No! You, then? No! I'll
favour number one by prompt attendance. Let any one who desires to die
hold up a hand.

     (_Silence around him._)

Oh! I see. You are prudish and would not like to see a blade naked. Not
a name? Not a hand?--Very well, then, I continue.

     (_Turning again to the stage, on which Montfleury is waiting in
     agony_).

I desire to see the stage cured of a monstrous tumor. And, if necessary,
I'll use ... (_putting his hand to his sword_) a lancet!

                              MONTFLEURY.

But I ....

            CYRANO (_gets off his chair and sits down on it,
                comfortably, with a wide circle around him_).

Attention, full moon! I'll clap my hands thrice. The third time, there
must be an eclipse.

                          THE PIT (_amused_).

Ah! Good!

                CYRANO (_striking his hands together_).

One!

                              MONTFLEURY.

But I ....

                      A VOICE (_from the boxes_).

Stay, Montfleury!

                                THE PIT.

Will stay, will not! Will stay, will not!

                              MONTFLEURY.

I believe, gentlemen ....

                                CYRANO.

Two!

                              MONTFLEURY.

It would be far better ....

                                CYRANO.

Three!

     (_Montfleury disappears as if by magic. General laughter,
     whistling, etc._)

            CYRANO (_leaning back in his chair, and crossing
                his legs_).

Let him return if he dares!

                             THE AUDIENCE.

The company's orator!

     (_Bellerose advances and bows._)

                               THE BOXES.

Ah! here is Bellerose!

                   BELLEROSE (_with great elegance_).

Noble lords ....

                                THE PIT.

No! No! Jodelet!

                    JODELET (_with a nasal twang_).

Disturbers of the peace! The heavy tragedian whose bulk suits your
fancy, felt....

                                THE PIT.

He is a coward!

                                JODELET.

Suddenly unwell ... and was compelled to retire.

                                THE PIT.

Let him return!--No!--Yes!--

                       A YOUNG MAN (_to Cyrano_).

But, after all, Sir, what reason is there for your hating Montfleury?

                CYRANO (_very courteous, still seated_).

Young gosling, there are two, either one of which is sufficient in
itself. First: he is a bad actor; he rants, and seems to lift with a
derrick lines that have wings of their own. Second: but that is _my_
secret.

                      TRADESMAN (_behind Cyrano_).

But, Sir, you deprive us of the pleasure of hearing "La Clorise." I
insist....

                CYRANO (_turning in his chair toward the
                    tradesman respectfully_).

Venerable mule, Baro's verse is worthless. I interrupt without the
slightest remorse.

                   THE "PRÉCIEUSES" (_in the boxes_).

Baro! Our Baro! Heavens! Is it possible?

             CYRANO (_turning his chair to the boxes, with
                  great courtesy_).

    Fair beings ....
  Irradiate and bloom, be Hebes, all,
  Dispensing dream; with smile make death a feast
  To us----inspire verse.... but judge it not!

                               BELLEROSE.

How about the money we'll have to return?

             CYRANO (_turning his chair toward the stage_).

Bellerose, you have said the only intelligent thing yet heard to-day. I
would not for the world make holes in the cloak of Thespis.

     (_He rises and throws a small bag upon the stage_).

Catch this purse and hold your tongue!

                      THE AUDIENCE (_bewildered_).

Ah!.... Oh!....

           JODELET (_picking up the purse and weighing it_).

For the same price, Sir, you may daily prevent the performance of "La
Clorise"!....

                             THE AUDIENCE.

Hu!.... Hu!....

                                JODELET.

Even if we are to be hooted .... Clear the house!

     (_The audience begins to leave. Cyrano looks on with great
     satisfaction. The crowd, however, soon stops as the following
     discussion begins. The ladies in the boxes, who had already risen
     to go, and put on their wraps, resume their seats_).

                         LE BRET (_to Cyrano_).

You are insane!

               AN INTRUDER (_who has come up to Cyrano_).

A comedian like Montfleury! Scandalous! Why! He is a favourite of the
Duke de Candale's! What powerful patron have you?

                                CYRANO.

None!

                             THE INTRUDER.

No patron?

                                CYRANO.

No!

                             THE INTRUDER.

What! no high-born gentleman whose name can shield you?

                         CYRANO (_impatient_).

I've said No twice already. A third time: No! I've no protector....
(_his hand on his sword_) but this!

                             THE INTRUDER.

You are going to leave town, then?

                                CYRANO.

Hardly probable.

                             THE INTRUDER.

But the Duke has a long reach!

                                CYRANO.

Not so long as mine .... (_showing his sword_) with this extension! Now,
go about your business.

                             THE INTRUDER.

But allow me....

                                CYRANO.

Go! Or, rather, tell me why you look so sharply at my nose.

                       THE INTRUDER (_abashed_).

What! I....

                                CYRANO.

Is there anything extraordinary about it?

                             THE INTRUDER.

Your lordship mistakes....

                                CYRANO.

Is it soft and swinging like an elephant's trunk?

                             THE INTRUDER.

I did not say....

                                CYRANO.

Or crooked like the beak of an owl?

                             THE INTRUDER.

No; I....

                                CYRANO.

Is there a wart on the end of it? Or a fly? What's amiss with it? Or is
it a phenomenon?

                             THE INTRUDER.

Why, I didn't even look at it!

                                CYRANO.

Why shouldn't you look at it? Is it repulsive?

                             THE INTRUDER.

My dear Sir....

                                CYRANO.

In colour unhealthy? In shape indecent?

                             THE INTRUDER.

Not at all!

                                CYRANO.

Why, then, seem to revile it? Perhaps the gentleman finds it rather
large?

                      THE INTRUDER (_stammering_).

I find it small, very, very small.

                                CYRANO.

How small? Ridiculously then? My nose small! Why, my nose is enormous!
Remember, vile flat-nose and flat-head, that I am proud of such an
appendix! For a large nose properly indicates a man that is affable,
kind, courteous, witty, liberal and brave, such as I am, and such as
you, miserable knave! can never be; for the inglorious face that my hand
is about to seek above your collar is as destitute ..... (_he slaps
intruder's face_).

                             THE INTRUDER.

Oh!

                                CYRANO.

Of pride, of flight, of poesy, of picturesqueness, of fire, of
magnificence, of Nose, in fact, as the one.... (_Cyrano seizes the
Intruder by the shoulders and kicks him in the seat_) that my boot now
reaches at the base of your back.

                       THE INTRUDER (_escaping_).

Help! Guards!

                                CYRANO.

  Fair warning, then, to idle lookers on
  Who criticise the centre of my face!
  The critic, if a gentleman, will get,--
  Before he flies,--in front and higher too,
  My custom's such, some steel instead of leather!

             GUICHE (_who with the marquises, has come down
                from the stage_).

The gentleman is getting very tiresome!

            VICOMTE DE VALVERT (_shrugging his shoulders_).

He is a braggart!

                                GUICHE.

And no one answers him?....

                              THE VICOMTE.

No one? Just wait. Such a retort as I'm going to send him!

     (_He advances toward Cyrano, who has been looking at him, and draws
     himself up with an air of foppish vanity._)

You.... you have a nose.... hum! a nose, Sir, that is.... very large.

                 CYRANO (_very quietly and seriously_).

Very large, indeed!

                         VICOMTE (_laughing_).

Ha! Ha!

                 CYRANO (_with great self-possession_).

Is that all?

                                VICOMTE.

Well, I....

                                CYRANO.

No, no, that's a little too short, young man! You might have said....
Well.... many things.... in different keys. For instance, listen:
_Aggressive_: "I, Sir, had I such a nose, would at once have it
amputated."--_Friendly_: "It must dip into your glass. To drink with
comfort, you should have a hanap constructed!"--_Descriptive_: "It is a
rock!... a peak!!.... a headland!!! More than a headland, a whole
peninsula!"--_Inquisitive_: "What may this oblong thing be used for? A
writing-desk or a tool-chest?"--_Pleasant_: "Do you love birds so much
that you feel bound to offer them so comfortable a resting
place?"--_Fierce_: "When you use tobacco, Sir, can you emit smoke from
that nose without your neighbours' crying that there is a chimney on
fire?"--_Thoughtful_: "Be careful; so much top-hamper might cause you to
fall!"--_Affectionate_: "Have a parasol made for it; the sun might fade
its colour!"--_Pedantic_: "For so much flesh on so much bone beneath the
forehead, we must go back, Sir, to the animal Aristophanes calls
Hippocampelephantocamelos!"--_Flippant_: "Why! man, is that the fashion
for hooks? Certainly convenient for hanging up a hat!"--_Emphatic_:
"Masterly nose, no wind can make you catch aught but a fractional cold!
None but a northern hurricane!"--_Dramatic_: "When it bleeds, we have
the Red Sea!"--_Admiringly_: "For a perfumer, what a sign!"--_Lyric_:
"Is it a shell trumpet, and are you a triton?"--_Innocent_: "When is
this monument open to visitors?"--_Respectful_: "This is really owning a
mansion with a gable on it!"--_Countrylike_: "That be not a nose, but a
big turnip, or a young melon!"--_Military_: "Point against
cavalry!"--_Practical_: "Will you put it up in a lottery? It will surely
be the largest prize!"--Finally, to parody the grief of Pyramus:

  So here we have the nose that on its master came
  To ruin harmony! The traitor's red for shame!

That is about what you might have said, dear boy, if you had a
sprinkling of letters and a bit of humour. Of humour, though, lamentable
being, you never had an atom; and, as to letters, you never had but the
four that spell the word Fool!--Some invention is requisite for
extravagant jests before such an audience, but, even if you had it, you
could not have uttered a quarter of the half of the beginning of what I
said; for I may be willing to serve such sport myself, but I allow
nobody to serve it to _me_.

           GUICHE (_endeavouring to lead away the Vicomte_).

Vicomte, pay no attention to him!

                        VICOMTE (_overwhelmed_).

Such arrogance! An insignificant little squire .... who .... who ....
doesn't even wear gloves!....and who sallies forth without ribbons, bows
or trimmings!

                                CYRANO.

  'Tis morally I have my elegance,
  I do not dress as does a fop, but I
  Am better groomed than some more richly clad.
  I'd not set forth with traces of neglect
  About me, say: an insult left unwashed,
  A conscience still confused and half asleep,
  My honour soiled, or scruples out of shape.
  When I proceed, I do so clean and bright,
  With truthful independence for a plume.
  'Tis not my form I lace to hold it up,
  It is my soul I try to elevate!
  The ribbons that I wear are only deeds;
  I twist perhaps my wit like a mustache;
  But then I cause, as I go through your groups,
  Above the clash of spurs, the truth to ring!

                                VICOMTE.

But, Sir ....

                                CYRANO.

I have no gloves on?.... What matters it? I did have one left from a
very old pair! One day I found it somewhat in the way .... and I left it
on somebody's face.

                                VICOMTE.

Knave, puppy, flat-footed ridiculous bully!

           CYRANO (_taking off his hat and bowing, as if the
                Vicomte had just presented himself_).

Ah! delighted!.... and I: Cyrano, Savinian, Hercules de Bergerac.

                                              (_Laughter around._)

                        VICOMTE (_exasperated_).

Buffoon!

            CYRANO (_uttering a cry as if he had a cramp_).

Ay!....

                VICOMTE (_who was leaving, returning_).

What is it now?

                   CYRANO (_grinning as if in pain_).

I must move it, for it is asleep.... What a mistake to let it remain
inactive.... Ay!....

                                VICOMTE.

What ails you?

                                CYRANO.

It's my sword that's tingling!

                     VICOMTE (_drawing his sword_).

Be it so!

                                CYRANO.

I'll show you a neat little thrust.

                       VICOMTE (_disdainfully_).

Poet!

                                CYRANO.

Yes, Sir, a poet! So much so that, while we play swords here, I
mean--hop!--on the spur of the moment, to improvise for you a ballade.

                                VICOMTE.

A ballade?

                                CYRANO.

Yes. I'll wager you do not know what is a ballade.

                                VICOMTE.

But....

                  CYRANO (_as if reciting a lesson_).

Well, then, a ballade is composed of three stanzas of eight lines
each....

                   VICOMTE (_stamping impatiently_).

Oh!

                         CYRANO (_continuing_).

Plus an Envoy of four lines. Twenty-eight lines in all, with only three
rimes....

                                VICOMTE.

You....

                                CYRANO.

I am going to compose one while fighting, and when I come to the last
line, Sir, I'll touch you!

                                VICOMTE.

You'll not!

                                CYRANO.

Be sure, I shall!

                                              (_Declaiming._)

Ballade of the Duel Between Monsieur de Bergerac and a Coxcomb.

                                VICOMTE.

What is that, if you please?

                                CYRANO.

That is the title.

                   THE AUDIENCE (_greatly excited_).

Make room there!.... Capital!.... Stand back!.... Be silent!....

     (_Tableau.--Circle of lookers-on in the pit,--marquises and
     officers, with the tradesmen and common people. Pages on each
     others' shoulders for a better view. All the women standing in the
     boxes. To the right, Guiche and his followers. To the left, Le
     Bret, Ragueneau, Cuigy, etc._).

               CYRANO (_closing his eyes for a moment_).

Wait....I'm selecting my rimes....There now, I'm ready!

     (_He does as he says while speaking the verses._)

  My hat with grace I cast aside;
  Next, watch me, please, I slowly free
  The cloak in which I'm wont to stride;
  And then I draw my sword, you see.
  A Celadon[9] you have in me,
  A Scaramuccia very much;
  But, pygmy, moderate your glee,
  For, when I close th' Envoy, I'll touch!

  'Twere better you had slept or died.
  O goose, where shall I puncture thee?
  Beneath the ribs? Above? Decide!
  Or through the breast, where ribbons be?
  The hilts are ringing. One, two, three!
  My sword, beware! is not a crutch.
  I'll strike according to decree,
  For, when I close th' Envoy, I'll touch!

  I seek in vain a rime in _ide_.
  You back--and whiten--let's agree
  Upon a word, say: trembling hide,
  So, tac! I parry, just a wee,
  Your vicious thrust. Now finish we!
  I open--quart--or something such----
  Hold well that spit, you dog, or flee,[10]
  For, when I close th' Envoy, I'll touch!

     (_He announces with solemnity_).

                               ENVOY.[11]

  Now, Prince, may heaven hear your plea!
  I follow, though you break and clutch.
  I cut--I feint--Be ready--Hee! (_He lunges._)

                                      (_Vicomte staggers; Cyrano bows._)

For now I close th' Envoy.... (_pointing to Vicomte_)

                              I touch!

     (_Applause in boxes. Flowers and handkerchiefs are thrown. Officers
     surround and congratulate Cyrano. Ragueneau dances for joy. Le Bret
     seems both overjoyed and dejected. The Vicomte's friends support
     him and bear him off._)

         A MUSKETEER (_most cordially shaking Cyrano's hand_).

Allow an expert to congratulate you, Sir, most heartily.

                                                          (_He leaves._)

                          CYRANO (_to Cuigy_).

Who is this gentleman?

                                 CUIGY.

D'Artagnan!

             LE BRET (_passing his arm through Cyrano's_).

Now let us talk!....

                                CYRANO.

Wait till the crowd has left.
                                                       (_to Bellerose_).
May we stay a while?

                        BELLEROSE (_to Cyrano_).

Certainly, Sir.

                                           (_giving orders to Janitor_).

Close the house, but do not put out the lights. We'll return after
dinner for a rehearsal.

                   (_Jodelet and Bellerose bow to Cyrano, then exeunt._)

                         JANITOR (_to Cyrano_).

You are not going to dinner, Sir?

                                CYRANO.

I?.... No.

                                            (_Exit Janitor._)

                         LE BRET (_to Cyrano_).

Why not?

                          CYRANO (_proudly_).

Because....

     (_changing his tone, when he sees that the Janitor has gone_).

Because I have no money!....

                  LE BRET (_as if throwing a purse_).

How about that bag of coin?

                                CYRANO.

Monthly allowance, thou wert short lived! One day!

                                LE BRET.

For a whole month, then....

                                CYRANO.

I have nothing left.

                                LE BRET.

To throw away thus your purse, what folly!

                                CYRANO.

Yes, but what a gesture!

                THE WAITING-GIRL (_behind the counter_).

Hum!

     (_Cyrano and Le Bret turn around. She advances timidly._)

Sir .... I cannot bear.... to see you fast.... (_Showing the buffet_). I
have here several things.... Take some!

                     CYRANO (_taking off his hat_).

My dear child, Gascon pride forbids my accepting from you the smallest
of your delicacies. But, on the other hand, I would not for the whole
world offend you, as my refusal might do. So I will with pleasure
accept....

     (_Goes up to the buffet and chooses._)

Oh! the smallest thing!.... ah! one grape from this bunch.

     (_She tries to make him take the bunch, but he picks out a single
     grape._)

Only one.... a glass of water....

     (_She tries to pour some wine, but he prevents her._)

Pure water!.... and half a maccaroon.

     (_He breaks a maccaroon in two, and returns one of the pieces._)

                                LE BRET.

What nonsense!

                             WAITING-GIRL.

Do have something more!

                                CYRANO.

Yes, your hand to kiss.

     (_He kisses her hand as if she were a princess._)

                             WAITING-GIRL.

Thank you, Sir!

     (_Curtsies._)

A very good evening!

                         (_Exit waiting-girl._)

  [9] Note.--One of the translations that have appeared in the New York
      daily press renders "Céladon" by reference to Lord Chesterfield!
      The time of action (first four acts) of "Cyrano de Bergerac" is
      1640, and Lord Chesterfield was _born_ only 54 years _later_.

  [10] Note.--In the original, Cyrano calls his opponent "Laridon." This
       is the name of a degenerate _dog_. See fables of La Fontaine
       ("L'Education").

  [11] Note.--"L'Envoi," as often written, supposedly in French, is
       incorrect. It is, in French, when heading the last four lines of
       a ballade, "Envoi," without the article, l' (le).


                               _SCENE V._

                   CYRANO, LE BRET, _later_ JANITOR.

                         CYRANO (_to Le Bret_).

Now, I'll listen to you.

     (_He goes to the buffet, on which he places the half maccaroon._)

Dinner!

     (_Then the glass of water._)

Drink!

     (_And the one grape from the bunch._)

Dessert!

     (_Takes a seat by the buffet._)

Now for the feast! My dear friend, I feel very hungry.... (_Eating_)
Well? You were saying?....

                                LE BRET.

That all these bellicose doings and the admiration they elicit will warp
your judgment. Go ask people of sense what they think of this last prank
of yours, of its effect.

                CYRANO (_finishing his half maccaroon_).

Enormous!....

                                LE BRET.

The Cardinal!....

                    CYRANO (_beaming with delight_).

He was there? The Cardinal?

                                LE BRET.

Yes, and he must have found you....

                                CYRANO.

Anything but commonplace.

                                LE BRET.

Nevertheless....

                                CYRANO.

He's an author. And he must have enjoyed seeing another's play crushed.

                                LE BRET.

You are, really, making too many enemies!

                   CYRANO (_munching his one grape_).

How many do you estimate I have made to-day?

                                LE BRET.

Forty-eight, without counting the women.

                                CYRANO.

Enumerate them.

                                LE BRET.

Montfleury, the tradesman, Guiche, the Vicomte, Baro, the Academy....

                                CYRANO.

You give me infinite joy!

                                LE BRET.

What will all this lead you to? What system is yours?

                                CYRANO.

I was really meandering, and I found so many conclusions to adopt,
through so many complications, that I came to this decision....

                                LE BRET.

Which is?....

                                CYRANO.

Oh! the simplest of all, by far. I decided to show myself admirable in
all, and for all!

                  LE BRET (_shrugging his shoulders_).

So be it!.... But come now, tell me, tell _me_, the true reason of your
hatred for Montfleury.

                           CYRANO (_rising_).

This Silenus, with a stomach like a hogshead, still believes himself a
danger to womankind. See him, while he stammers on the stage, ogling
like a carp, with his frog's eyes! I hate him since he dared, once, to
set those eyes of his upon her.... Oh! I felt as if I saw a long slug
crawling over a flower!

                         LE BRET (_astounded_).

What, is it possible?....

                    CYRANO (_with a bitter laugh_).

That I love?

     (_changing to a solemn tone_).

I do love.

                                LE BRET.

Whom? May I enquire? You never told me.

                                CYRANO.

Whom I love? Come now, reflect. The dream of being loved, even by a
homely girl, is one forbidden me. Forbidden by this nose of mine that
precedes me everywhere by fifteen minutes. So, then, I love .... Whom?
Why! it is most natural! I love .... it could not be otherwise, the
loveliest of the lovely!

                                LE BRET.

The loveliest?....

                                CYRANO.

Exactly .... in the world! The most brilliant, the most exquisite,
(_crushed_) the blondest!

                                LE BRET.

  This woman is?....

                                CYRANO.

                    A deadly danger, though
  She knows it not; a snare that Nature made
  Unconscious, like a sweetly budding rose
  Whose leaves conceal,--in ambush lurking, love.
  Who sees her smile knows what perfection is:
  Her slightest touch engenders loveliness;
  She moves as if all heaven's grace were hers,
  And Venus ne'er embarked in any shell,
  Nor did Diana tread the sylvan paths
  As my adored can step into a chair!

                                LE BRET.

I understand! Quite clear.

                                CYRANO.

Transparent, say.

                                LE BRET.

It's Magdeleine, your cousin?

                                CYRANO.

Yes, Roxane.

                                LE BRET.

  Well, where's the harm? You love her? Tell her so!
  She witnessed here just now your valiant deed!

                                CYRANO.

  Why! Look at me, good friend, and say what hope
  There can be with .... such a protuberance!
  I clearly see the truth. But, then, of course,
  My heart will beat, perchance, at eventide,
  If, with this nose, I scent the breath of spring.
  Or else, I see, along some moonlit path,
  A whisp'ring pair of lovers slowly move;
  And then I think what rapture would be mine
  If on my arm a gentle creature leaned.
  I dream: but suddenly, I'm brought to sense.
  By what? Alas! My profile on the wall!

                                LE BRET.

  Dear friend!....

                                CYRANO.

                  Yes, friend, it's hard indeed to feel
  So homely and forlorn at times....

                      LE BRET (_taking his hand_).

                                        You weep!

                                CYRANO.

  Weep? Never! Oh! a sorry sight, indeed,
  If down this nose a tear should take its course!
  I will not have, so long as I command,
  The saintliness of tears polluted by
  This homeliness of mine. Remember, friend,
  That nothing's more sublime than flowing tears.
  So would I not allow a single one
  To cause a laugh, or seem ridiculous!

                                LE BRET.

Come, come, do not be sad. In love there is hazard, remember.

                      CYRANO (_shaking his hand_).

No! I love Cleopatra: do I resemble a Cæsar? I adore Berenice: do I look
like a Titus?

                                LE BRET.

But, friend, your bravery, intelligence and wit!.... Take that girl
there who just now offered you your dinner. Did her eyes seem to detest
you?

                           CYRANO (_struck_).

It's a fact.

                                LE BRET.

Well, then, hope!.... Why! Roxane was pale and trembling, ghastly pale,
while she followed your duel here!....

                                CYRANO.

Ghastly pale?

                                LE BRET.

Her heart and mind were certainly struck. Pick up courage and speak to
her, so that....

                                CYRANO.

So that she bursts out laughing into my face .... under my very nose?
No, no!.... That is the only thing in the world that I fear!

           THE JANITOR (_bringing in the duenna, to Cyrano_).

Somebody for you, Sir.

                     CYRANO (_seeing the duenna_).

Great heavens! Her duenna!


                              _SCENE VI._

                      CYRANO, LE BRET, THE DUENNA.

                   THE DUENNA (_with a long curtsy_).

A fair cousin would like to know where a valiant cousin can be seen, in
private.

                     CYRANO (_greatly disturbed_).

I be seen, in private?

                    DUENNA (_with another curtsy_).

Yes, be seen. There are things to be said.

                                CYRANO.

There are things....

                       DUENNA (_another curtsy_).

To be said.

                         CYRANO (_staggering_).

Heavens!

                                DUENNA.

We'll hear to-morrow early mass, at the church of Saint-Roch.

                     CYRANO (_leaning on Le Bret_).

Heavens!

                                DUENNA.

As we go out, we can chat a bit, I fancy.

                         CYRANO (_bewildered_).

Where?.... I .... But .... Heavens!

                                DUENNA.

Decide.

                                CYRANO.

I'm thinking....

                                DUENNA.

Where?....

                                CYRANO.

At.... at.... Ragueneau's.... the pastry-cook's....

                                DUENNA.

Where's that?....

                                CYRANO.

Rue.... Rue.... Heavens! Rue St.-Honoré!

                          DUENNA (_leaving_).

We'll be there by seven sharp. Be punctual.

                                CYRANO.

I shall!

                            (_Exit Duenna._)


                              _SCENE VII._

  CYRANO, LE BRET, THE COMEDIANS _and_ COMEDIENNES, CUIGY, BRISSAILLE,
                  LIGNIÈRE, THE JANITOR, THE VIOLINS.

              CYRANO (_falling into the arms of Le Bret_).

I!.... She.... An appointment!....

                                LE BRET.

So, now your sadness is no more?

                                CYRANO.

No! for, whatever the reason, she knows that I exist!

                                LE BRET.

And now you will be cool?

                       CYRANO (_beside himself_).

No, I'll be frantic and invincible! I would I had an army to defeat! I
have ten hearts and twenty arms. What are dwarfs to me?.... (_He
shouts._) I must have giants to vanquish!

     (_For the last few minutes, on the stage, in the rear, actors and
     actresses have been going and coming: a rehearsal is on. The
     violins have taken their seats._)

                      A VOICE (_from the stage_).

Silence there, please! We're rehearsing.

                          CYRANO (_laughing_).

Very well. We're leaving.

     (_As Cyrano is about going, enter, by the wide door in the rear,
     Cuigy, Brissaille, and several officers, supporting Lignière, who
     is completely intoxicated._)

                                 CUIGY.

Cyrano!

                                CYRANO.

What is it?

                                 CUIGY.

A friend of yours.

                    CYRANO (_recognising Lignière_).

Lignière!.... Why! what is the matter?

                                 CUIGY.

He was looking for you.

                              BRISSAILLE.

He cannot get home.

                                CYRANO.

Why not?

            LIGNIÈRE (_thick-tongued, showing a note soiled
                  and torn_).

This note warns me .... a hundred men are posted .... on account of a
song .... I'll be murdered .... at the Porte de Nesle .... there I must
pass .... to get home .... Offer me shelter .... under your roof!

                                CYRANO.

One hundred men, you say? You'll sleep under your own roof.

                        LIGNIÈRE (_terrified_).

But how can I?....

           CYRANO (_in fierce tones, showing him the lighted
              lantern held by the Janitor, who has been listening_).

Take that lantern!

     (_Lignière seizes the lantern._)

And walk on boldly. I swear to you that I to-night will make your bed
for you. (_To the officers._) You, gentlemen, be good enough to follow
.... at a distance. You'll be witnesses.

                                 CUIGY.

Yes, but one hundred men!....

                                CYRANO.

To-night I would not have them fewer by a single man!

     (_The comedians and comediennes, who have, in their costumes, come
     down from the stage into the pit, crowd around Cyrano._)

                                LE BRET.

But why protect this....

                                CYRANO.

There's Le Bret grumbling again!

                                LE BRET.

This commonplace drunkard?....

              CYRANO (_playfully striking Lignière on the
                  shoulder_).

Because this drunkard, this cask of Muscatel, this barrel of Rossoli,
once did something exceedingly handsome: his lady-love, as she was
leaving church, after mass, having properly dipped her dainty finger
into the holy water near the door, he, though he has a horror for water,
ran up to the stoup, leaned over it and drank it dry!

                  COMEDIENNE (_in soubrette's dress_).

A pretty deed, I think.

                                CYRANO.

Was it not, soubrette?

                     COMEDIENNE (_to the others_).

But why a hundred men against a poor poet?

                                CYRANO.

Let us on!.... (_to the officers_) .... and you, gentlemen, when you see
me charge, please do not follow; simply look on, whatever danger I may
be in!

                              COMEDIENNE.

But we wish to see too!

                                CYRANO.

Come along, then!

                      COMEDIENNE (_to the troop_).

Let us all go?

                                CYRANO.

Come, all of you, the Doctor, Isabella, Leander, all! Come as a bevy
pleasant and frolicsome! Come, and let the fantasy of Italian farce
tinkle through the rumble of to-night's Spanish drama, surrounding it
with jingles like a tambourine!

                     THE WOMEN (_jumping for joy_).

Bravo! Quick, a wrap! a hood!....

                                JODELET.

Let us proceed!

                       CYRANO (_to the violins_).

Will the violins supply the music?

     (_The violins join the formation. Candles are taken from the
     footlights and distributed; and thus a torch-light procession is
     prepared._)

                                CYRANO.

Bravo! Officers, gentlemen and women in fancy dress! Now, ten steps
ahead .... (_he places himself as he speaks_) I, alone, beneath the
plume that glory itself stuck into this hat .... proud as a Scipion
thrice Nasica!.... Understood?.... All assistance to me is forbidden!
Ready?.... Open the door!

     (_Janitor opens the door, through which can be seen a bit of old
     Paris, picturesque in the moonlight._)

  Ah! Paris in the dimness of the night,
  With moonlight trickling down the bluish roofs.
  For coming deed how exquisite the frame!
  'Neath mist as light as gauze, behold! the Seine,
  As if it were a magic mirror there,
  Is trembling .... and you'll see what you shall see!

                                  ALL.

To the Porte de Nesle!

                      CYRANO (_on the threshold_).

To the Porte de Nesle!

     (_Turning, before going out, to the soubrette_).

Did you not ask, Madamoiselle, why against this one rimester a hundred
men were sent?

     (_He draws his sword and continues very quietly._)

Because he is known to be a friend of mine!

     (_Exit Cyrano. The procession--Lignière with unsteady head--the
     comediennes hanging upon the arms of the officers, then the
     comedians dancing and capering--moves out into the night, with the
     violins for music, and with candles for light._)

                               _CURTAIN._

  [Illustration: _FIRST ACT._]




                               _ACT II._

                         THE POET'S COOK-SHOP.


_The shop of Ragueneau, poulterer and pastry-cook, a large establishment
in Paris, on the corner of the Rue St.-Honoré and the Rue de
l'Arbre-Sec. In the rear, through the wide glazed door, the streets are
plainly seen, grey in the light of dawn._

_To the left, first entrance, a counter, above which is an iron frame,
from hooks on which are suspended geese, ducks and white peacocks. Large
crockery vases containing ordinary plants, principally sunflowers. On
the same side, second entrance, a wide fireplace, before which, between
two monumental andirons, on each of which a pot is hung, several roasts,
the fat of which is dripping into pans._

_To the right, first entrance, a door. Second entrance, a staircase
leading up to a small inside room, the interior of which is visible
through its open blinds; a table is there, with cover set, lighted by a
Flemish chandelier. A wooden gallery at the top of the staircase leads
seemingly to other rooms of the same sort._

_In the centre of the shop, an iron ring is hung: it can be lowered by
means of a pulley, and on it are large pieces of game, meat, hams, etc.
It forms a peculiar sort of chandelier._

_Under the staircase, the glow of several ovens. Copper saucepans shine.
Spits are turning. Morning activity. Cook-boys run in and out. Fat chefs
are seen now and then. Loads of cakes and meat-pies are brought in on
willow trays._

_Tables are garnished with cakes and eatables. Other tables, with chairs
around, are prepared for customers. A small table in a corner is covered
with papers. Before it is seated Ragueneau, who is writing, as the
curtain rises._


                               _SCENE I._

          RAGUENEAU, PASTRY-COOKS, _then_ LISE. RAGUENEAU _is
                  writing and counts on his fingers_.

                 FIRST PASTRY-COOK (_bearing a dish_).

Candied fruits!

               SECOND PASTRY-COOK (_with another dish_).

Pie!

                  THIRD PASTRY-COOK (_with a roast_).

Peacock!

                  FOURTH PASTRY-COOK (_with a tray_).

Cakes!

              FIFTH PASTRY-COOK (_with an earthen bowl_).

Stewed beef!

               RAGUENEAU (_stops writing and looks up_).

  The copper's yellow sheen is silvered by the dawn[12]
  Now smother, Ragueneau, the godly notes you love!
  Sweet poesy must wait--just now is cooking time!

                                  (_He rises. To one of the cooks_).

Look here! Your sauce is thick, and you must lengthen it.

                                 COOK.

How much?

                               RAGUENEAU.

Three feet.

                                          (_Passes on._)

  O Muse, keep thou aloof, or else your pleading eyes
  Will suffer from the glare of vulgar fires here!

                          (_to one of the pastry-cooks_).

  These loaves are badly set, the split should not be thus,
  Cesuras should be placed between the hemstitches.

     (_to another, pointing to an unfinished meat-pie_).

  This palace made of crust is fine, but needs a roof.

     (_to an apprentice boy who, seated on the floor, is running a fowl
     on a spit_).

  The spit is long enough for chickens, turkeys, all,
  But alternate, my boy, and imitate Malherbe:
  His lines the longest were relieved by shorter ones.
  Do you the same, prepare real stanzas on the spit!

               ANOTHER APPRENTICE (_carrying a tray over
                    which is a large napkin_).

  Dear Master, this for you was in the oven cooked.
  We wish to please you, Sir!

                               RAGUENEAU.

                                 A lyre!

                            THE APPRENTICE.

                                           Made of paste!

                          RAGUENEAU (_moved_).

Of candied fruits besides! And strings of sugar, too!

                            THE APPRENTICE.

To give a sweeter tone!

                 RAGUENEAU (_handing him some money_).

                            It's fine; go drink my health

     (_seeing Lise, as she enters_).

My wife! Be silent--skip!

     (_to Lise, showing her the lyre_).

                              Fine work!

                                 LISE.

                                          Ridiculous!

     (_She lays on the counter a bundle of paper bags._)

                               RAGUENEAU.

Some bags; I thank you, dear.

                           (_Looks at the bags._)

                               The manuscripts I love!
  The verses of my friends! All mutilated! Torn!
  To serve as wrappers for .... such prosy things as cakes!
  It's Orpheus once again pursued by the Bacchantes!

                           LISE (_harshly_).

  I use the only thing your friends in payment give;
  Your sorry scribblers bent on not completing lines!

                               RAGUENEAU.

  The ant should not insult the magic cricket's song!

                                 LISE.

  Before these crickets thus possessed you wholly, dear,
  You never said to me: bacchante, or even: ant!

                               RAGUENEAU.

  Treat verses thus!

                                 LISE.

                       Why not?

                               RAGUENEAU.

                                   What would you do with prose?

  [12] Note.--Alexandrines were adopted, instead of pentameter, here and
       further on, with the poets, for the reason that they seem more
       pompous and better in keeping with the affectation shown by the
       personages.


                              _SCENE II._

            _The same_, TWO CHILDREN _come in to buy cakes_.

                               RAGUENEAU.

What is it, little ones?

                              FIRST CHILD.

We want three patties, please.

                      RAGUENEAU (_serving them_).

Here they are, well-browned, just out of the oven.

                             SECOND CHILD.

Please wrap them up for us.

                          RAGUENEAU (_aside_).

Alas! my bags!

     (_to the children_). Oh! wrap them up, hey?....

     (_takes one of the bags to use it, but first reads from it_).

"As was Ulysses when he left Penelope...."
Not this one!....

     (_puts the bag aside, and takes up another, from which also he
     reads_).

"Blond Phoebus...."               Not this one!

                                  (_Sets the bag aside._)

                       LISE (_out of patience_).

Well, what are you waiting for?

                               RAGUENEAU.

Coming! Coming!

     (_takes up a third bag and then with resignation_).

The sonnet to Philis!.... pretty hard too!

                                 LISE.

You were long enough about it!

     (_shrugging her shoulders_).

Goose!

     (_She climbs upon a chair to arrange dishes and plates on a
     shelf._)

             RAGUENEAU (_taking advantage of the fact that
                her back is turned, calls back the children
                who were just passing out_).

Pst!.... Little ones!.... Return me the bag and instead of three patties
I'll give you six.

     (_The children give him the bag, take the cakes and leave.
     Ragueneau smoothes the paper and reads_).

"Philis!" .... On this sweet name, a grease spot!.... "Philis!"

     (_Cyrano enters abruptly._)


                              _SCENE III._

              RAGUENEAU, LISE, CYRANO, _then_ A MUSKETEER.

                                CYRANO.

What time is it?

                    RAGUENEAU (_bowing low to him_).

Six o'clock.

                          CYRANO (_excited_).

In one hour!

     (_Walks to and fro through the shop._)

                      RAGUENEAU (_following him_).

Bravo! I witnessed....

                                CYRANO.

What?

                               RAGUENEAU.

Your fight.

                                CYRANO.

Which one?

                               RAGUENEAU.

The one at the Hôtel de Bourgogne.

                        CYRANO (_disdainfully_).

Oh!.... that duel!....

                       RAGUENEAU (_admiringly_).

Yes, your duel in verse.

                            LISE (_aside_).

In verse!.... His mouth seems to him too small for the words!

                        CYRANO (_to Ragueneau_).

Ah!.... So much the better!

           RAGUENEAU (_lunging with the spit he has seized_).

  "For, when I close th' Envoy, I'll touch!...."
  "For, when I close th' Envoy, I'll touch!...."
  How beautiful!.... (_with growing enthusiasm_).
  "For, when I close th' Envoy,...."

                                CYRANO.

Ragueneau, what time is it?

          RAGUENEAU (_remaining with arm and leg outstretched,
              simply turning his head to look at the clock_).

Five minutes after six!....
                                  "I touch!"

                                        (_He rises._)

Oh! to write a ballade!

            LISE (_to Cyrano, who, on passing near her, has
                absent-mindedly shaken hands with her_).

Why! what is the matter with your hand?

                                CYRANO.

Oh! nothing! A scratch.

                               RAGUENEAU.

Were you exposed to any peril?

                                CYRANO.

No peril!

               LISE (_threatening him with her finger_).

I fear you are not telling the truth!

                                CYRANO.

What! Did my nose move? What an enormous lie that would indicate!
(_becoming serious_). I expect somebody here. If that somebody
comes--you never can tell,--please leave us here alone.

                               RAGUENEAU.

That is hardly possible; my rimesters[13] are coming....

                           LISE (_ironical_).

For their first meal.

                                CYRANO.

You will have to take them away when I make a sign to you.... What time
is it?

                               RAGUENEAU.

Ten minutes after six.

             CYRANO (_sitting down nervously at Ragueneau's
                  table, and taking some paper_).

A pen, please!....

              RAGUENEAU (_offering him the one that he has
                  behind his ear_).

A swan quill.

              A MUSKETEER (_with an enormous mustache and
                      stentorian voice_) _enters_.

Good morning!

     (_Lise goes rapidly up to him._)

                       CYRANO (_turning around_).

Who is this?

                               RAGUENEAU.

A friend of my wife's. A terrible warrior,--at least so he says!....

                CYRANO (_taking up the pen and motioning
                    away Ragueneau_).

Silence!.... write--fold,--(_to himself_) hand it to her,--and run
away....

     (_throwing away the pen_). Coward!....But may I die if I dare speak
  to her, even a single word....

              (_to Ragueneau_). What time is it?

                               RAGUENEAU.

A quarter past six!....

                    CYRANO (_striking his breast_).

But I have plenty of words here, and by writing....

     (_Takes up the pen._)

  So be it then! I'll write.--This letter fraught
  With love, I've thought it out a hundred times;
  It's ready, and, to close it, I have but
  To read my soul, and copy what I read.

     (_He writes. Behind the glazed door, a movement of lean and
     hesitating forms._)

  [13] Note.--The spelling _rime_ seems preferable to _rhyme_, since
       rime and rhythm are two very distinct things.


                              _SCENE IV._

         RAGUENEAU, LISE, THE MUSKETEER, CYRANO, _by the table,
           writing_, THE POETS, _clad in black, bedraggled_.

                    LISE (_entering, to Ragueneau_).

Here are your bedraggled friends!

                 FIRST POET (_entering, to Ragueneau_).

Brother-poet!....

             SECOND POET (_shaking Ragueneau by the hand_).

Dear brother-poet!

                              THIRD POET.

Eagle of pastry-cooks!

      (_sniffing_) It smells good in your nest.

                              FOURTH POET.

O Phoebus-Caterer! Apollo master-cook!....

                   RAGUENEAU (_somewhat bewildered_).

How soon one feels at ease with them!

                              FIRST POET.

  We were delayed a bit by something of a crowd,
  Close by the Porte de Nesle!....

                              SECOND POET.

                    By sword both slashed and pierced,
   Eight cut-throats bleeding fast illustrated the street.

                         CYRANO (_looking up_).

Eight?.... I thought seven.

                                (_continues writing._)

                        RAGUENEAU (_to Cyrano_).

Who fought so bravely? Do you know?

                CYRANO (_treating the matter lightly_).

I?.... No!

                       LISE (_to the Musketeer_).

Do you?

                  MUSKETEER (_curling his mustache_).

Perhaps.

        CYRANO (_writing--mutters a word now and then, aside_).

I love you....

                              FIRST POET.

A single man, they say, put all the band to flight!....

                          CYRANO (_writing_).

Your eyes!....

                              SECOND POET.

Why! Spears and hats were found a hundred yards away!

                          CYRANO (_writing_).

Your lips!....

                              FIRST POET.

Quite fearless must be he who fought so many thus.

                          CYRANO (_writing_).

And I am like to faint, outdone, when you appear.

               SECOND POET (_helping himself to a cake_).

What new rimes can you give us, Ragueneau?

                          CYRANO (_writing_).

Who loves you!....

     (_He stops just as he was going to sign, rises, folds the letter
     and puts it into his doublet._)

Signature unnecessary. I'll hand her the letter myself.

                     RAGUENEAU (_to Second Poet_).

I have put a recipe into verse.

             THIRD POET (_settling near a tray of tarts_).

Oh! let us hear the lines.

                              FOURTH POET.

This cake is crooked. Make it straight.

                                        (_Eats it._)

                              SECOND POET.

We are listening.

                              THIRD POET.

This tart will lose its cream. We'll save it.

                                  (_Eats the tart._)

            SECOND POET (_breaking off and eating a piece of
                the candied lyre_).

The only time perhaps a lyre's fed its man.

             RAGUENEAU (_who has been preparing to recite,
                coughing, settling his cap and striking an
                attitude_).

A recipe in verse....

                     SECOND POET (_to First Poet_).

Why! you are breakfasting!

                     FIRST POET (_to Second Poet_).

                                    And you are dining, friend!

                               RAGUENEAU.

                       HOW TO MAKE ALMOND TARTS.

  Beat up to foam, discarding dregs,
        Your choice of eggs.
  Add carefully into the foam
  Some citron juice that's new and stout;
        Then lengthen out
  With milk of almonds made at home.

  Next, coat with dough, both fresh and sound,
        Below, around,
  Such moulds as pastry-cooks prepare.
  Add sweetening to suit your taste
        Into the paste.
  Then pour quite slowly and with care

  Your foam into each well[14], so well
        That ev'ry well,
  When it is baked to blondness, starts
  To seek the walks that pleasure sings.
        These seemly things
  Are rightly christened: almond tarts.

                       THE POETS (_mouths full_).

Most exquisite! Divine!

                     ONE OF THE POETS (_choking_).

Humph!

     (_They go to the rear, still eating. Cyrano, who has been watching
     them, goes up to Ragueneau._)

                                CYRANO.

  They seem to drink your verse, my friend; but see you not
  How they assimilate your stock of eatables?

                  RAGUENEAU (_in low tone, smiling_).

  I see, but notice not, for fear I'd trouble them;
  And reading so my lines affords me double joy,
  Since thus I satisfy a weakness that I own,
  And feed the while poor souls whose pressing need is food!

                CYRANO (_striking him on the shoulder_).

I like you, Ragueneau!....

     (_Ragueneau joins his friends, the poets. Cyrano looks at him for a
     while, then suddenly says:_)

Tell me there, Lise!

     (_Lise, who seems to be engaged in a very animated flirtation with
     the Musketeer, starts and comes down to Cyrano._)

This captain.... seems to be besieging you?

                           LISE (_offended_).

Oh! my eyes have a look haughty enough to vanquish all who attack my
virtue.

                        CYRANO (_very firmly_).

I like Ragueneau very much. For this reason, Mistress Lise, I forbid
that anybody should make him ridiculous.[15]

                                 LISE.

But you mistake....

              CYRANO (_speaking loud, so as to be heard by
                  the Musketeer_).

A word to the wise....

     (_He bows to the Musketeer, and, after looking at the clock, goes
     to the door, where he stands looking out._)

              LISE (_to the Musketeer, who simply returned
                  Cyrano's bow_).

Really, you surprise me!.... Why do you not answer?.... Speak of his
nose....

                             THE MUSKETEER.

His nose.... his nose.... that is easily said....

     (_Retires rapidly, Lise following._)

            CYRANO (_from the door, signals to Ragueneau to
                draw away the poets_).

Pst!....

             RAGUENEAU (_pointing out to the Poets the door
                to the right_).

We shall be much more comfortable in there....

                  CYRANO (_getting out of patience_).

Pst!.... Pst!....

                 RAGUENEAU (_pushing the Poets along_).

We'll read some more verses.

            FIRST POET (_in despair, with his mouth full_).

But the cakes!....

                              SECOND POET.

Let us take them along.

     (_They all go out, following Ragueneau, in a sort of procession,
     after having loaded themselves with cakes._)

  [14] Note.--The miserable pun on "puits" (well) was found possible to
       reproduce. Needless to add that this is ambitious confectioner's
       verse, intentionally nonsensical.

  [15] Note.--_Ridicuckoldulous_ would be an exact translation.


                               _SCENE V._

                      CYRANO, ROXANE, THE DUENNA.

                                CYRANO.

I shall hand her my letter if I feel that there is any hope, however
slight!....

     (_Roxane, masked, and followed by the Duenna, appears behind the
     glazed door, that Cyrano opens eagerly._)

Be pleased to enter!....

     (_Walking up to the Duenna_). As to you, Duenna, one word!

                                DUENNA.

Four words, if you will, Sir.

                                CYRANO.

Are you fond of cake and such?

                                DUENNA.

To and beyond excess.[16]

             CYRANO (_taking paper bags from the counter_).

Good! Here are two sonnets....

                                DUENNA.

Ugh!

                                CYRANO.

....That I fill with tartlets.

                      DUENNA (_looking pleasant_).

Ah!

                                CYRANO.

Are you fond of cream cakes?

                                DUENNA.

More than fond when they contain too much cream!

                                CYRANO.

Here are six for you, wrapped in a poem. Do you like all cakes?

                                DUENNA.

All, all, all.

         CYRANO (_loading her with paper bags full of cakes_).

Here are a few. Go now and eat them.... outside.

                                DUENNA.

But I....

                      CYRANO (_pushing her out_).

And do not return until you have eaten them all.

     (_He closes the door, comes down toward Roxane, takes off his hat,
     and stops, respectfully, at a distance._)

  [16] Note.--The Duenna, like Roxane, is a "précieuse," an euphuist.


                              _SCENE VI._

              CYRANO, ROXANE, _and, a moment_, THE DUENNA.

                                CYRANO.

  Among all moments be the present blessed,
  Since, ceasing to forget that I exist,--
  However humbly--you have come to say....
  To say....

                      ROXANE (_who has unmasked_).

             To say: I thank you heartily.
  For, know you now, the fop, the brainless wretch
  You vanquished yesterday in noble strife,
  Was being forced upon me....

                              (_bashfully_)

                                ....As a mate
  For life, by one who says he loves me....

                                CYRANO.

                                                 Guiche!....
  Who's good at scheming thus....

                                (_saluting_)

                                  So then I fought,
  Not for my nose, but for your smiling eyes.

                                ROXANE.

  And then I wished.... but the admission needs
  That I should find in you.... the brother that
  You were of yore....when we were children both.

                                CYRANO.

  When Bergerac was our summer ground....

                                ROXANE.

  And reeds made up your goodly stock of swords....

                                CYRANO.

  While waving corn gave flowing hair for dolls.

                                ROXANE.

  What happy days! For you my will was law....

                                CYRANO.

  You're now Roxane; you then were Madeleine.

                                ROXANE.

  And pretty?

                                CYRANO.

                            You were not a sorry sight.

                                ROXANE.

  How often, romping, you would get a hurt!
  Then, motherly, I'd say, in sternest voice:
  "Another frolic and another scratch!"....

     (_She stops astonished._)

The same to-day! What's this?

     (_Cyrano tries to withdraw his hand._)

                                              No, let me see!
  You're still a boy, it seems.--Say when and how!

                                CYRANO.

At play just now, around the Porte de Nesle.

            ROXANE (_taking a seat at one of the tables, and
               wetting her handkerchief in a glass of water_).

Your hand!

                   CYRANO (_taking a seat near her_).

                   How gently thoughtful you've remained!

                                ROXANE.

How many foes?

                                CYRANO.

                             Not quite a hundred.

                                ROXANE.

                                                          Oh!
Do tell me all!

                                CYRANO.

                  What for? It's better far
  You tell me what you did not dare to say....

                                ROXANE.

  But now I dare. The memories of yore
  Assist me. I'm....in love with somebody.

                                CYRANO.

Indeed!

                                ROXANE.

                Who knows it not....

                                CYRANO.

                                            Indeed!

                                ROXANE.

                                                           .... Not yet.

                                CYRANO.

Indeed!

                                ROXANE.

                But he shall know it soon.

                                CYRANO.

                                                 Indeed!

                                ROXANE.

  Poor fellow, he has loved me timidly,
  And from afar, and never dared to speak!

                                CYRANO.

Indeed!

                                ROXANE.

Your hand is feverish.... Oh! I easily could see the truth beneath his
bashfulness!

                                CYRANO.

Indeed!....

             ROXANE (_as she finished bandaging his hand_).

And see what a coincidence, dear cousin! He belongs to your regiment!

                                CYRANO.

Indeed!....

                          ROXANE (_laughing_).

Why, of course, he is a cadet in your Company!....

                                CYRANO.

Indeed!

                                ROXANE.

He bears on his brow the mark of intelligence, of genius!
He is haughty, noble, young, intrepid, handsome,....

                     CYRANO (_rising, very pale_).

Handsome!

                                ROXANE.

Why! what is the matter?

                                CYRANO.

The matter? Nothing .... It is .... It is ....

     (_Showing his hand and smiling_). This little scratch.

                                ROXANE.

Oh! Well, I really love him. I must say, however, that I have seen him
only at the Theatre ....

                                CYRANO.

Then you have not spoken to each other?

                                ROXANE.

Our eyes alone have done the talking.

                                CYRANO.

Well, then, how do you know?

                                ROXANE.

Beneath the linden trees of the Place Royal there is some gossipping
.... and information has reached me ....

                                CYRANO.

He is a cadet, you say?

                                ROXANE.

Yes, a cadet in the Guards.

                                CYRANO.

His name?

                                ROXANE.

Baron Christian de Neuvillette.

                                CYRANO.

How?.... There is nobody of that name among the cadets.

                                ROXANE.

Oh! yes, there is, since this morning. His Captain is Carbon of
Haughty-Hall.

                                CYRANO.

And so, quick, quick, we throw away our little heart?.... But my poor
child....

                 THE DUENNA (_looking in at the door_).

Monsieur de Bergerac, I have finished the cakes!

                                CYRANO.

Well, then, read the verses that you will find on the bags!

     (_Duenna disappears._)

.... My poor child, for you who are accustomed to refined language, to
subtle thoughts,--suppose he were thoroughly uninitiated, in fact, a
savage!

                                ROXANE.

Oh! no, he has the hair of a hero!

                                CYRANO.

Suppose he were as poor in speech as rich in hair.

                                ROXANE.

No, all his words are choice; I can tell by seeing him.

                                CYRANO.

Of course, all words are choice when they come through a mustache that
is well curled.--But suppose he were a dunce!....

       ROXANE (_striking the floor with her foot, impatiently_).

Well, it would kill me! There!

                       CYRANO (_after a pause_).

And it is to tell me this that you asked me to meet you here? I fail to
see the necessity of the appointment, Madam.

                                ROXANE.

The fact is that somebody frightened me yesterday by telling me that you
are all Gascons in your Company....

                                CYRANO.

And that we challenge any beardless hero who, through influence, and not
being really a Gascon, manages to get assigned to our Gascon Company?
That is what you were told.

                                ROXANE.

And you imagine how I tremble for him?

                     CYRANO (_between his teeth_).

Not without good reason!

                                ROXANE.

But then I was reminded of you, and of your skill and courage, your
great achievements; and I thought: if he, Cyrano, whom everyone
respects, would....

                                CYRANO.

'Tis well. I'll answer for your little baron.

                                ROXANE.

Yes, defend him always, please. And many thanks! You know how fond of
you I've always been?

                                CYRANO.

Oh! yes, I know.

                                ROXANE.

You'll be his friend?

                                CYRANO.

I will.

                                ROXANE.

And he shall have no duels to fight.

                                CYRANO.

None; you have my promise.

                                ROXANE.

Ah! you are my dearest friend.--But I must go.

     (_She puts on her mask again, throws a lace scarf over her head,
     and then, in an unconcerned way says:_)

But you did not relate to me your battle of last night. You must have
been grand!.... Tell him to write me.

     (_Sends him a kiss with her hand._)

Dear, dear friend!

                                CYRANO.

All is understood.

                                ROXANE.

One hundred men against one: you!--So, good bye!--We are the best of
friends, are we not?

                                CYRANO.

Assuredly, we are!

                                ROXANE.

Tell him to write!.... One hundred men!.... You'll tell me all about it
later. To-day I cannot listen. One hundred men! How brave!

                           CYRANO (_bowing_).

Oh! I have done better since.

     (_Exit Roxane. Cyrano remains motionless, his eyes on the floor.
     Silence. The door to the right opens, and Ragueneau passes in his
     head._)


                              _SCENE VII._

         CYRANO, RAGUENEAU, THE POETS, CARBON OF HAUGHTY-HALL,
            THE CADETS, THE CROWD, _etc._, _later_ LE BRET,
                           _and then_ GUICHE.

                               RAGUENEAU.

The coast is clear?

                         CYRANO (_motionless_).

Yes.

     (_Ragueneau makes a sign, and his friends come in. At the same
     moment appears in the doorway Carbon of Haughty-Hall, in full
     uniform of Captain of the Guards; he lifts his arms on discovering
     Cyrano._)

                                CARBON.

Here he is at last!

                      CYRANO (_raising his eyes_).

Captain!....

                          CARBON (_rejoiced_).

Our hero! We heard it all. Thirty at least of the Cadets are here!....

                        CYRANO (_falling back_).

But, Captain....

                  CARBON (_trying to take him along_).

Come! They wish to see you!

                                CYRANO.

No, I cannot!

                                CARBON.

They are over the way, at the Inn of the Cross.

                                CYRANO.

I cannot.

           CARBON (_going to the door and shouting outside_).

Our hero refuses. He is out of sorts!

                          A VOICE (_outside_).

Sandious![17]

     (_Noise outside. Sound of swords and boots drawing near._)

                     CARBON (_rubbing his hands_).

They are crossing the street!....

                   THE CADETS (_invading the shop_).

Milledious!--Capededious!--Mordious!--Pocapdedious!

                  RAGUENEAU (_retreating in terror_).

Why, gentlemen, are you all from Gascony?

                              THE CADETS.

Everyone of us!

                         A CADET (_to Cyrano_).

Bravo!

                                CYRANO.

Baron, yours!....

                ANOTHER CADET (_shaking Cyrano's hand_).

Bravo!

                                CYRANO.

Yours, baron!

                              THIRD CADET.

Allow me to embrace you!

                                CYRANO.

Baron, baron!

                            SEVERAL CADETS.

Let us all embrace him!

                                CYRANO.

Baron.... baron.... spare me!....

                               RAGUENEAU.

But, gentlemen, are you all barons?

                              THE CADETS.

All of us!

                              FIRST CADET.

With our coronets alone you could build a tower.

               LE BRET (_enters and runs up to Cyrano_).

An enthusiastic crowd is looking for you!

                         CYRANO (_frightened_).

You didn't tell them where I am?

                     LE BRET (_rubbing his hands_).

Of course I did!

     (_The street is crowded with pedestrians, chaises and coaches, all
     stopping before the door._)

You saw Roxane?

                          CYRANO (_rapidly_).

Be silent!

                         THE CROWD (_outside_).

Cyrano! Cyrano!

     (_They invade the shop, pushing each other, and shower Cyrano with
     congratulations._)

                   RAGUENEAU (_standing on a table_).

My shop is taken by storm! and almost wrecked! Beautiful! Beautiful!

                         PEOPLE AROUND CYRANO.

Dear friend!.... Brave friend.... Heroic friend!....

                                CYRANO.

Yesterday I had nothing like as many friends!....

                         LE BRET (_delighted_).

Success, you see! Success!

             A MARQUIS (_running up with extended hands_).

If you only knew, dear boy....

                                CYRANO.

Dear boy? Dear boy? On what field did we ever camp together?

                                MARQUIS.

I should be pleased to present you, Sir, to some ladies who are outside
in my coach.

                                CYRANO.

But, first, you--who will present you to me?

                        LE BRET (_dumbfounded_).

Why! friend, what ails you?

                                CYRANO.

Be silent, please!

               A MAN OF LETTERS (_with pen and tablets_).

May I not gather some details....

                                CYRANO.

You may not!

                      LE BRET (_aside to Cyrano_).

But this is Theophraste Renaudot, who invented the gazette!

                                CYRANO.

I care not!

                                LE BRET.

.... That sheet in which are found so many things of interest. The idea,
it is said, has before it a great future.

                                A POET.

Dear Sir, I desire to build upon your name a pentacrostic.

                             ANOTHER POET.

I desire, dear Sir,....

                                CYRANO.

Enough! Enough!

     (_Movement. The crowd becomes more orderly and opens. Guiche
     appears, with an escort of officers: Cuigy, Brissaille, the
     officers who accompanied Cyrano at the close of Act I._)

                    CUIGY (_running up to Cyrano_).

Here is Monsieur de Guiche! He is sent by Marshal de Gassion!

                      GUICHE (_bowing to Cyrano_).

.... Who desires to express to you, Sir, his admiration for the
wonderful prowess that we have just heard of.

                               THE CROWD.

Bravo! Bravo!

                           CYRANO (_bowing_).

The Marshal is a connoisseur in deeds of valour.

                                GUICHE.

He never would have believed the feat possible, if these gentlemen had
not sworn that they witnessed it.

                                 CUIGY.

With our own good eyes!

        LE BRET (_aside, to Cyrano, who seems lost in thought_).

My good friend....

                         CYRANO (_to Le Bret_).

Be silent!

                      LE BRET (_aside to Cyrano_).

You seem to suffer!

              CYRANO (_awakening and drawing himself up_).

Before all these people!.... I .... Suffer!.... Watch, and you shall
see.

          GUICHE (_to whom Cuigy has whispered a few words_).

All know that you have accomplished wonders before this. You are serving
the King with these hare-brained Gascons, are you not?

                                CYRANO.

Yes, with the cadets.

                    A CADET (_in stentorian tones_).

With us!

               GUICHE (_looking at the Gascons, who have
                  aligned behind Cyrano_).

Ah! ah!.... So these haughty-looking gentlemen are the famous....

                                CARBON.

Cyrano!

                                CYRANO.

Captain?

                                CARBON.

Since my Company is all here, I believe, present it to the Count, if you
please.

              CYRANO (_taking two steps toward Guiche, and
                  pointing to the Cadets_).

  Fair Gascony's cadets are they,
  With Carbon--He of Haughty-Hall;[18]
  They fight and lie without dismay,
  Fair Gascony's cadets are they!
  In heraldry they've all to say,
  And pedigrees like theirs appall.
  Fair Gascony's cadets are they,
  With Carbon--He of Haughty-Hall!

  With eagle eye, in crane's array,
  With cat's mustache, and tooth for all,
  Through rabble growling as they may,
  With eagle eye, in crane's array,
  They strut with hats in sad decay
  Beneath their plumes so bright and tall!
  With eagle eye, in crane's array,
  With cat's mustache, and tooth for all!

  Abdomen-Blade and Slash-Away
  Are names to them of pleasant fall.
  They thirst for glory night and day
  Abdomen-Blade and Slash-Away!
  In every battle brawl, or fray....
  They congregate as for a ball....
  Abdomen-Blade and Slash-Away
  Are names to them of pleasant fall!

  Fair Gascony's cadets are they
  To husbands....writing on the wall!
  O woman, wench of godly clay,
  Fair Gascony's cadets are they!
  Though jealous masters fume and bray,
  Let trumpet sound! Let cuckoo call!
  Fair Gascony's cadets are they,
  To husbands, writing on the wall!

            GUICHE (_comfortably seated in an armchair that
                Ragueneau promptly brought in_).

A poet is one of our choice luxuries to-day. Will you be mine?

                                CYRANO.

No, Sir, nobody's!

                                GUICHE.

Your ready wit, yesterday, caused much amusement to my uncle Richelieu.
I shall take pleasure in recommending you to him.

                          LE BRET (_dazzled_).

What a good fortune!

                                GUICHE.

You certainly must have rimed some five-act tragedy?

                   LE BRET (_whispering to Cyrano_).

Your "Agrippine!" You'll have it played!

                                GUICHE.

Yes, take your work to the Cardinal.

                   CYRANO (_delighted and tempted_).

But, really....

                                GUICHE.

He is quite an expert, but will not make too many corrections!

              CYRANO (_whose face has immediately resumed
                  its severe look_).

Impossible, Sir! My blood curdles at the thought of my verse being
improved by the displacement or the addition of a single comma.

                                GUICHE.

But, on the other hand, my dear fellow, when a line pleases him, he pays
for it a large price.

                                CYRANO.

Not so large a one as I myself pay. When I have written a line and then
I fall in love with it, I buy it from and sing it to myself.

                                GUICHE.

Your disposition is a proud one!

                                CYRANO.

Really, you noticed it?

           A CADET (_enters with, strung on a sword, a number
                of hats, crushed, pierced and very much dejected as
                to plumes_).

Behold, Cyrano! This morning, on the quay, we found this sorry feathered
game. The hats of those you put to flight!....

                                CARBON.

Spolia opima!

     (_Everybody laughs ._)

                                 CUIGY.

Whoever paid these cut-throats must to-day regret his bargain.

                              BRISSAILLE.

Does anyone know who it is?

                                GUICHE.

It is I!

     (_Laughing stops short._)

I had hired them--a nobleman is above doing these things himself--to
chastise--a drunkard rimester.

     (_General embarrassment._)

          THE CADET (_aside to Cyrano, pointing to the hats_).

What shall we do with them? They are greasy enough to make a stew.

            CYRANO (_taking the sword on which the hats are
                strung, and allowing them, as he salutes, to
                slip off at the feet of Guiche_).

You may desire, Sir, to return them to your friends.

                 GUICHE (_rising and in sharp tones_).

My chair, immediately!

     (_to Cyrano, angrily_).

As to you, Sir!....

                       A VOICE (_in the street_).

The chair of his lordship Count de Guiche.

       GUICHE (_who has conquered his feelings and now smiles_).

No doubt you've read Don Quixote?

                                CYRANO.

                                    Yes, and, when
  I hear the name of this enthusiast,
  I doff my hat.

                                GUICHE.

                 Then kindly meditate
  The windmill chapter....

                           CYRANO (_bowing_).

                                               Yes,--I know--thirteenth.

                                GUICHE.

When windmills are attacked it happens oft....

                                CYRANO.

Have I attacked some noble weather-vane?

                                GUICHE.

  That, if their mighty arms revolve, a man
  Is dashed to earth!....

                                CYRANO.

                                Or lifted to the stars!

     (_Exit Guiche, who enters his chair. His friends, whispering. Crowd
     withdraws._)


                             _SCENE VIII._

       CYRANO, LE BRET, THE CADETS, _who have taken seats at the
                 tables, and are eating and drinking_.

            CYRANO (_bowing out in an affectedly polite way
                those who are leaving without taking any
                further notice of him_).

Gentlemen--delighted--Delighted--gentlemen--

                LE BRET (_lifting his arms in despair_).

A pretty mess you've made of it!

                                CYRANO.

Oh! of course! As usual, you must growl!

                                LE BRET.

Come, now, you must admit that this constant assassination--that is the
word--of every passing opportunity is, to say the least, a gross
exaggeration.

                                CYRANO.

Well, yes, I do exaggerate. There!

                        LE BRET (_triumphant_).

You see!

                                CYRANO.

But I do so as a matter of principle, for the sake of example. In my
opinion, such exaggeration is good.

                                LE BRET.

  Suppose you set aside, a while, your soul
  Heroic and success....

                                CYRANO.

                         What should I do?....
  Set out to find a power, influence,
  A master, then? A lowly ivy be
  That licks the trunk it uses for support?
  Creep up by stealth, instead of rising strong?
  I thank you, no!--Inscribe the verse I write
  To money bags, and play the low buffoon,
  To cause, on lips that I despise, a smile?
  I thank you, no! For breakfast eat a toad?
  Wear out, or soil, especially my knees?
  Forever prove how pliant is a spine?
  I thank you, no! Give--only to exact?
  Have ready praise for all, and strive to be
  A pygmy hero in a puny ring?
  I thank you, no! Ask publishers to print
  My verse--at my expense? I thank you, no!
  Seek favour from the solemn councils held
  By pompous fools in taverns and the like?
  I thank you, no! Or try to build a name
  Upon a single sonnet, sooner than
  Write other sonnets? No. I thank you, no!
  Be terrorized by journals vague and small,
  And hope the while they'll not forget me? No,
  I thank you! Ever weigh, observe and fear?
  Place gossip far above poetic lines?
  Solicit, beg, crave notoriety?
  I thank you, no! I thank you, nay!.... But, oh!....
  To sing, to dream, to laugh, to be alone
  And free, with eyes that naught will cause to turn,
  And with a voice that naught will cause to shake!
  To cock your hat, if you feel so disposed:
  For this, or that, to fight--or write a verse!
  To plan, without a thought of gold or fame,
  A novel trip, perhaps unto the moon!
  To write but what is honestly your own,
  And, diffident for once, reflect: my boy,
  Be satisfied with flower, fruit.... or leaf,
  If they have grown on soil that's strictly yours!
  Then, if perchance a bit of fame is earned,
  To feel that none of it to Cæsar's due!
  The truth is there, and so is honesty:
  Despise to ape the ivy-parasite,
  And try to be an oak, or elm, to rise,
  Not very high, perhaps, but rise alone!

                                LE BRET.

  Alone, you're right! But not opposing all!
  Why should you make so many enemies?

                                CYRANO.

  Because I see you make so many friends,
  And smile on them with mouths I'll not describe.[19]
  I'm glad to pass with fewer greetings met,
  And proud to think: another enemy!

                                LE BRET.

  You are insane!

                                CYRANO.

                  Perhaps. My vice is such.
  I'm pleased if I displease. Indeed, I love
  To gather hatred. Friend, you've never felt
  The thrill that's caused by walking on erect,
  While fifty pairs of eyes are sending shot,
  As if they were so many guns! And then....
  How comical the spots on doublets made
  By envy's gall and cowardice's slaver!
  --Loose friendships like to those you cultivate
  Resemble the Italian collars, soft
  And open-worked, that feminize your necks.
  They're easy and of tranquil-going mien;
  Your head with them can bend to any will.
  Not so with me! For Hatred, every morn,
  Makes stiff the ruff that forces up my head!
  An enemy I gain's another fold
  That straightens me the more, perhaps, but adds
  A beam to my renown. The Spanish ruff,
  Though sitting on the neck as would a yoke,
  With some can be a halo 'round the head!

      LE BRET (_after a pause, passing his arm through Cyrano's_).

  Speak out aloud your pride and bitterness,
  But whisper to me then: she loves me not!

  [17] Note.--This is a Gascon oath. Like the similar oaths following,
       it would if translated literally (Blood of God,) lose its
       picturesque and really innocent character. All of these are
       oath-sounds rather than oaths, and somewhat oath-evading, after
       the fashion of "goldarn it," in America.

  [18] Note.--The name "Castel-Jaloux," in the original, being
       indicative of Gascon pride and superlativeness, it was thought
       better to translate it in order to preserve colour. But here
       arose the question: "Him" or "He" of Haughty-Hall? Both cases
       have their champions, with most excellent reasons. It was
       thought, however, that argument might be avoided and the line be
       made more effective by the insertion of a dash after "Carbon,"
       thus leaving time for the imaginary interrogation: "What Carbon?"
       following which suspension, the answer is. "He of Haughty-Hall"
       is the Carbon meant.

  [19] Note.--The text here, justified by a current French expression,
       would be too broad in English.


                              _SCENE IX._

         CYRANO, LE BRET, THE CADETS, CHRISTIAN DE NEUVILLETTE.

          A CADET (_seated at a table in the rear, drinking_).

Cyrano!

     (_Cyrano turns._)

That narrative, please.

                                CYRANO.

Yes, presently!

     (_He takes the arm of Le Bret, going up and speaking in low tone to
     him._)

                 THE CADET (_rising and coming down_).

The details of the fight! They will make the best kind of lesson....
(_stopping near the table before which Christian is seated_) for a timid
apprentice!

                       CHRISTIAN (_looking up_).

Apprentice!

                             ANOTHER CADET.

Just so, sickly northerner!

                               CHRISTIAN.

Sickly!

                      FIRST CADET (_sneeringly_).

Monsieur de Neuvillette, there's something you must learn, to wit: there
exists a thing that, with us, must never be even alluded to--no more
than a rope in the house of one who was hung.

                               CHRISTIAN.

And what is that?

                 ANOTHER CADET (_in terrifying tone_).

Look at me!

     (_With his finger he, three times, strikes his nose._)

                                      You understand?

                               CHRISTIAN.

Oh! you mean the....

                             ANOTHER CADET.

Hush!.... The word is never pronounced....

     (_pointing to Cyrano, who, in the rear, is talking with Le Bret_).

.... Or else trouble is sure.

            ANOTHER CADET (_who, while Christian was looking
                the other way, took a seat on the table_).

Two men were killed by him because they spoke through the nose--a
subject he dislikes!

              ANOTHER CADET (_springing up from underneath
                  the table, where he had crawled_).

Those who desire to die young have but to come here and speak of the
fatal cartilage.

      ANOTHER CADET (_placing his hand on Christian's shoulder_).

One word's enough. Did I say: a word? One motion, just one, suffices.
And drawing out one's handkerchief is equivalent to weaving one's
shroud!

     (_Silence. All the Cadets remain, with folded arms, staring at
     Christian. Christian goes up to Carbon of Haughty-Hall, who has
     been conversing with an officer and affecting not to notice the
     proceedings._)

                               CHRISTIAN.

Captain!

              CARBON (_turning, and with a severe look_).

Sir?

                               CHRISTIAN.

When one encounters southerners possessed of too much braggadocio....

                                CARBON.

The right thing to do? Prove to them that you may come from the North
and still be brave.

     (_Carbon turns._)

                               CHRISTIAN.

Captain, I thank you.

                       FIRST CADET (_to Cyrano_).

And now your narrative!

                             OTHER CADETS.

Yes, his narrative!

                    CYRANO (_coming down to them_).

My narrative? Well, here it is!

     (_They gather around him, some seated, some standing. Christian
     straddles a chair._)

Well, then, I was walking along so as to meet them. The moon, in the
sky, looked like a big silver watch; when suddenly some zealous
watch-maker, I suppose, began passing over it, with a view to making it
shine, no doubt, some cloudy cotton. In consequence, the night became as
dark as possible, and, mordious! I could not see further....

                               CHRISTIAN.

Than the end of your nose.

     (_Silence. Everybody rises slowly, frightened, and looking at
     Cyrano, whom the interruption has astounded. General expectancy._)

                                CYRANO.

Who is this man?

                      A CADET (_in subdued tone_).

One who joined this morning.

                   CYRANO (_going toward Christian_).

This morning?

                                CARBON.

His name is Baron de Neuvillette.

                     CYRANO (_rapidly, stopping_).

Oh! very well then!....

     (_He turns pale, then reddens, and appears ready to throw himself
     upon Christian._)

I must....

     (_restraining himself, however_).

That is different. (_resuming_). As I was saying....

     (_with ill-concealed fury_).

Mordious!....

     (_continuing in a natural tone_).... I could not see very far.

     (_General stupefaction. All take their seats again, looking at
     Cyrano._)

So, I was walking on, thinking how I was going to disappoint some mighty
lord desirous of pulling....

                               CHRISTIAN.

Your nose!....

     (_Everybody rises again, while Christian rocks on his chair._)

                        CYRANO (_half choking_).

My ears!.... and how imprudent some people might find me for thus
poking....

                               CHRISTIAN.

Your nose....

                                CYRANO.

No, my finger, between the tree and the bark. For this great lord might
be powerful enough to rap me....

                               CHRISTIAN.

On the nose....

         CYRANO (_wiping the perspiration from his forehead_).

No, on the fingers. But I said to myself: go ahead, Gascon; do your
duty! On, Cyrano! Then, abruptly, out of the dark, somebody made a lunge
at me. I parried: when suddenly, I found myself....

                               CHRISTIAN.

Nose to nose....

                    CYRANO (_bounding toward him_).

Ventre--Saint--Gris!....

     (_All the Gascons advance to witness the scene. But Cyrano, on
     coming up to Christian, masters himself, and continues:_)

Confronted by a hundred drunken rascals.... smelling....

                               CHRISTIAN.

With their hundred noses....

                 CYRANO (_pale as death, but smiling_).

....Strongly of onion and garlic! I rushed forward blindly....

                               CHRISTIAN.

Without nosing....

                                CYRANO.

And charged them! Down went two of them. A third I ran through. They
lunged, I parried, and struck down, how many?....

                               CHRISTIAN.

Who knows!....

                     CYRANO (_bursting with rage_).

Thunder and lightning! Clear the room!

     (_The Cadets rush toward the door._)

                              FIRST CADET.

The tiger wakes!

                                CYRANO.

All out! Leave me alone with this man!

                             SECOND CADET.

We'll find the fellow in mince-meat.

                               RAGUENEAU.

Mince-meat. Not fit, though, for my pies.

     (_All go out, by the rear, the sides and the staircase. Cyrano and
     Christian remain face to face staring at each other fiercely._)


                               _SCENE X._

                           CYRANO, CHRISTIAN.

                                CYRANO.

Embrace me!

                               CHRISTIAN.

Sir!....

                                CYRANO.

You are brave.

                               CHRISTIAN.

Perhaps. But....

                                CYRANO.

Very brave. I prefer it so.

                               CHRISTIAN.

Kindly explain....

                                CYRANO.

Embrace me! I am her brother!

                               CHRISTIAN.

Whose brother?

                                CYRANO.

Her's! Roxane's!

                    CHRISTIAN (_running up to him_).

You! The brother of Roxane?

                                CYRANO.

Well, very much the same: a brotherly cousin.

                               CHRISTIAN.

And she?....

                                CYRANO.

Told me all!

                               CHRISTIAN.

Does she love me?

                                CYRANO.

Perhaps!

                  CHRISTIAN (_taking Cyrano's hands_).

How happy I feel, Sir, to know you!

                                CYRANO.

Rather a sudden sentiment, is it not?

                               CHRISTIAN.

Forgive me, but....

              CYRANO (_looking well at him, and laying his
                  hand on Christian's shoulder_).

It's a fact. A fine-looking fellow, this rascal!

                               CHRISTIAN.

I only wish you knew, Sir, how much I admire you.

                                CYRANO.

Yes? But what of all those noses that you....

                               CHRISTIAN.

I withdraw them, Sir!

                                CYRANO.

Roxane expects a letter to-night.

                               CHRISTIAN.

That is the trouble.

                                CYRANO.

How so?

                               CHRISTIAN.

I am lost if I remain silent!....

                                CYRANO.

Well then?....

                               CHRISTIAN.

But, I am ashamed to own it, I am too stupid to write.

                                CYRANO.

Stupid? You are not, friend, since you realise your inability. Moreover,
your attack upon me was not that of a dunce.

                               CHRISTIAN.

Oh! it is easy enough to find words for a fight! Yes, perhaps I have a
sort of easy, military wit; but, facing women, I am struck dumb. Oh!
their eyes seem favourable enough as I pass them....

                                CYRANO.

Are not their hearts the same when you stop?

                               CHRISTIAN.

No, for I belong to those--and I know it--who tremble, and know not how
to speak of love.

                                CYRANO.

Strange!.... It seems to me that, if I were better looking, I should
belong to the other class: those who know and dare.

                               CHRISTIAN.

Oh! that I could with elegance express my feelings!

                                CYRANO.

Or be a pretty little musketeer!

                               CHRISTIAN.

Roxane is a "_précieuse_," and, in her eyes, I shall be disgraced!

                    CYRANO (_looking at Christian_).

Oh! that for the feelings of my soul I had such an interpreter!

                       CHRISTIAN (_despairing_).

What would I not give for eloquence!

                          CYRANO (_eagerly_).

I'll lend you some! Lend you to me your physical attraction, and the two
combined will constitute the hero of a romance.

                               CHRISTIAN.

What then?

                                CYRANO.

Would you feel equal to repeating the daily lessons I could give you?

                               CHRISTIAN.

What is it you propose?

                                CYRANO.

In Roxane's eyes you shall not be disgraced. Together, if you will, we
can gain her love. Will you allow the soul so ill-restrained by my
buckskin here to breathe and sing beneath your embroidered doublet?....

                               CHRISTIAN.

But Cyrano....

                                CYRANO.

.... Christian, will you?

                               CHRISTIAN.

Would it give you so much pleasure?

                         CYRANO (_enraptured_).

It would....

     (_returning to his senses, and lightly_)

It would amuse me!

  A trial this to tempt a poet. Come!
  We shall complete each other, if you will.
  You'll walk, and I'll be near you in the shade!
  I'll be the breath, and you shall be the form!

                               CHRISTIAN.

But that letter she expects. I cannot write it....

             CYRANO (_taking from his doublet the letter he
                  wrote a while before_).

Your letter?.... Here it is!

                               CHRISTIAN.

How is this?

                                CYRANO.

It lacks nothing but the address. You may send it. Feel no anxiety. It
is as it should be.

                               CHRISTIAN.

But how is it that you?....

                                CYRANO.

  We poets have about us, as a rule,
  Fine letters to the women we adore....
  In our dreams. For we belong to those
  Whose love is but a fleeting fancy blown
  Into the rainbow-bubble of a name!
  Take this and make a truth of what is feigned.
  My rambling words of rapture flutter like
  Bewildered birds; you'll cause them to alight.
  The letter shows, itself--now take it!--that
  My eloquence was born of artifice.

                               CHRISTIAN.

But there may be a few words to change. Thus, written at random, will it
fit Roxane?

                                CYRANO.

It will fit her like a glove! Human vanity is so credulous that Roxane
will never doubt the letter was written for her!

                               CHRISTIAN.

You are my dearest friend!

     (_He throws himself into Cyrano's arms. They remain embracing._)


                              _SCENE XI._

          CYRANO, CHRISTIAN, THE GASCONS, THE MUSKETEER, LISE.

                   A CADET (_half opening the door_).

Complete silence.... the silence of death.... I fear to look around!

     (_after a survey_) What!....

                SEVERAL CADETS (_entering and looking at
                    Cyrano and Christian locked in each
                    other's arms_).

Ah!.... Oh!.... Impossible!....

     (_Consternation._)

                      THE MUSKETEER (_jeeringly_).

Well, well!....

                                CARBON.

Our quarrelsome demon has become as lamblike as an apostle! Struck on
one of his nostrils--he offers the other!

                             THE MUSKETEER.

So, now we may speak of his nose!....

     (_calling Lise, triumphantly_).

Lise, just come and see!....

     (_sniffing with affectation_).

Why!.... Why!.... this is surprising! It smells here of....

     (_going up to Cyrano_).

But you, Sir, must have noticed it? It smells of....

                 CYRANO (_slapping Musketeer's face_).

Five-leaf clover!

     (_General rejoicing, Cyrano is himself again. Cadets turn
     somersaults._)

                               _CURTAIN._

  [Illustration: _SECOND ACT._]




                               _ACT III._

                          THE KISS OF ROXANE.


_A small public square in the old Marais quarter of Paris. Old houses,
narrow streets. To the right Roxane's house and garden, over the wall of
which spread and hang the branches of large trees inside. Above the
door, a window and a balcony. By the door a stone bench._

_Ivy creeps up the wall, and a jasmine twines around the balcony. By
means of the bench and of stones projecting from the wall, it is
comparatively easy to climb up to the balcony._

_Over the way, an old house in the same style, brick and stone, with a
door, the knocker of which is wrapped with rags like a sore finger._

_As the curtain rises, the Duenna is seated on the bench. The window on
Roxane's balcony is wide open. Standing near the Duenna is Ragueneau,
wearing a sort of livery. He is concluding a story, and wiping his
eyes._


                               _SCENE I._

    RAGUENEAU, THE DUENNA, _later_ ROXANE, CYRANO, _and two pages_.

                               RAGUENEAU.

.... And then she left with a Musketeer! Deserted and ruined, I hung
myself, and I was already off for another world, when enter Monsieur de
Bergerac. He unhung me and offered me to his cousin for a steward.

                              THE DUENNA.

But how were you ruined so?

                               RAGUENEAU.

Lise had a weakness for the military, and I for poets. Mars ate all the
cakes that Apollo left. Oh! they made short work of it!

           THE DUENNA (_rises and calls toward the window_).

Roxane! Are you ready? We'll be late.

                VOICE OF ROXANE (_through the window_).

I'm putting on my cape!

               THE DUENNA (_to Ragueneau, pointing to the
                  door of the house over the way_).

We are expected over there, at Clomire's. She holds her literary
assizes. There will be a reading. Subject: The Tender Passion!

                               RAGUENEAU.

The Tender Passion, indeed!

                        THE DUENNA (_smirking_).

The Tender Passion. Why not?

     (_calling toward the window_).

Roxane, come down! Or we shall miss the discourse on The Tender Passion.

                            VOICE OF ROXANE.

I am coming!

     (_Sound of string instruments growing gradually nearer._)

               VOICE OF CYRANO (_singing in the wings_).

La, la, la, la!

                       THE DUENNA (_surprised_).

Music for us!

        CYRANO (_followed by two pages each with an archlute_).

I say again that it's a demi-semi-quaver, you triple fool!

                       FIRST PAGE (_with irony_).

So then, Sir, you have thorough knowledge of quavers?

                                CYRANO.

I am a musician, as are all the disciples of Gassendi.

                   THE PAGE (_playing and singing_).

La, la!

              CYRANO (_snatching from him the archlute and
                  continuing the music_).

I can go on! La, la, la, la!

                  ROXANE (_appearing on the balcony_).

So, it is you?

                  CYRANO (_continuing the same air_).

Yes, I who come to celebrate the lily, And to extol the glory of the
ro....se!

                                ROXANE.

I'll be down in a moment.

     (_She leaves the balcony._)

          THE DUENNA (_to Cyrano, pointing to the two pages_).

And who may be these two songsters?

                                CYRANO.

Oh! they are part of a bet I won. D'Assoucy and I had a discussion on a
point of grammar. No! Yes! No! Yes! Of a sudden he points to these two
scarecrows here, his constant escort, great in the art of scratching a
string with a claw, and he says: "I'll bet you a whole day of
music!"--He lost. And now, until to-morrow comes, I must enjoy both the
strains and the presence of these two harmonious witnesses of all my
acts!.... Pleasant, if you like, in the beginning, but now the pleasure
is growing less.

     (_to the musicians_).

Hep!.... Just go and play a pavan--with my compliments--for that actor
Montfleury!

     (_Pages go up. To the Duenna_).

I've come this evening--as on previous evenings--

     (_to the Pages who are leaving_).

Play long,--and out of tune!

                                                          (_to Duenna_).

To ask Roxane if the friend of her soul is still as faultless as before.

                  ROXANE (_coming out of the house_).

How beautiful, how clever he is! and how I love him!

                          CYRANO (_smiling_).

Indeed! And is Christian so very clever?....

                                ROXANE.

Yes, dear friend, more so even than yourself!

                                CYRANO.

So be it, then!

                                ROXANE.

To my mind, it would be impossible for anyone to deliver with more
elegance and wit than he does these pretty trifles that are nothing, if
you will--and still are everything. At times, it is true, he seems quite
absent-minded; but, suddenly, he recovers and says the most charming
things!

                        CYRANO (_incredulous_).

You surprise me!

                                ROXANE.

You men are really astonishing! Because Christian is handsome, he _must_
be stupid!

                                CYRANO.

I doubt if he can speak of hearts and love.

                                ROXANE.

He does not speak of, he lectures on them, Sir!

                                CYRANO.

And he writes?

                                ROXANE.

Still better. Just listen.

     (_reciting_).

"The more you take of what's my heart, the more I've left."

     (_triumphantly_).

What think you of that?

                                CYRANO.

So! So!

                                ROXANE.

And of this? (_reciting_).

  "Since I must suffer and, to suffer, have a heart,
  If you would keep the heart that's mine, then send me yours."

                                CYRANO.

At first he had too much heart; now he has not enough. It would be
interesting to know exactly how much heart would satisfy him.

                                ROXANE.

You are exasperating! True jealousy!....

                           CYRANO (_moved_).

What?....

                                ROXANE.

An author's jealousy! And is not this just as lovely as possible?
Listen!

  "T'ward you my heart, I swear, has but a single cry,
  And, if in written lines fond kisses could be sent,
  O Madam, you would read this letter with your lips!"

         CYRANO (_with an unconscious smile of satisfaction_).

Ha! ha! the lines are.... hum! hum!....

     (_recovering and disdainfully_).

              .... really pretty weak!

                                ROXANE.

Indeed! And this?

                                CYRANO.

Why! do you remember all his letters?

                                ROXANE.

Every one of them!

                                CYRANO.

Undoubtedly, this is quite a compliment!

                                ROXANE.

He is a master!

                        CYRANO (_with modesty_).

Oh!.... a master!....

                       ROXANE (_with decision_).

A master, I say!

                                CYRANO.

So be it! A master!

                THE DUENNA (_returning from the rear_).

Monsieur de Guiche!

     (_to Cyrano, pushing him toward the house_).

Get into the house. It is better he should not see you here--or else he
might suspect....

                         ROXANE (_to Cyrano_).

Yes, discover my secret. He loves me; he is powerful, and he must not
know of my love. He could destroy it!

                     CYRANO (_entering the house_).

Very well, then, very well!

     (_Enter Guiche._)


                              _SCENE II._

              ROXANE, GUICHE, THE DUENNA, _at a distance_.

                 ROXANE (_to Guiche, with a curtsey_).

I was just going out.

                                GUICHE.

And I have come to take leave, before starting for the front.

                                ROXANE.

Oh!....

                                GUICHE.

I am ordered to the siege of Arras....

                                ROXANE.

Oh!....

                                GUICHE.

.... and I go to-night.

                                ROXANE.

Oh!....

                                GUICHE.

My departure does not seem to distress you greatly....

                                ROXANE.

Oh!....

                                GUICHE.

.... But I seriously grieve over it. Shall I ever see you again?....
When?.... By the way, I have been given a high command.

                        ROXANE (_indifferent_).

I congratulate you!

                                GUICHE.

The Guards regiment.

                         ROXANE (_interested_).

Oh! the Guards?

                                GUICHE.

Yes, the regiment in which is your cousin, the man of boastful words.
I'll have my revenge when I get him at the siege.

                          ROXANE (_overcome_).

What! the Guards are going there?

                          GUICHE (_laughing_).

Of course, since they are now my regiment.

                ROXANE (_sinking on the bench--aside_).

Christian!

                                GUICHE.

What ails you?

                           ROXANE (_moved_).

This.... departure.... grieves me sorely. To know that those you....
care for.... are going to battle!

                   GUICHE (_surprised and pleased_).

Why is it I hear words so sweet only on the day of my departure?

           ROXANE (_changing her manner and using her fan_).

So, then, you mean to seek revenge on my cousin Cyrano?

                         GUICHE (_surprised_).

Do you take his part?

                                ROXANE.

I? Not at all. I am against him.

                                GUICHE.

Do you see him often?

                                ROXANE.

Very seldom.

                                GUICHE.

I meet him everywhere.... with one of those cadets.... this Neu....
vil.... Neuvil....

                                ROXANE.

A tall man?

                                GUICHE.

A blond.

                                ROXANE.

Red-haired, rather.

                                GUICHE.

Handsome!....

                                ROXANE.

For some, perhaps, but....

                                GUICHE.

But very stupid.

                                ROXANE.

So it struck me! (_changing her manner_).

....Your revenge as regards Cyrano no doubt consists in holding him
under fire, which he relishes. So I hardly see great vengeance for you
in that. I can tell you, though, what would wound him to the quick!....

                                GUICHE.

And that is?....

                                ROXANE.

To have his regiment and his dear cadets remain, so long as there is
war, right here, in Paris, inactive! The only way to punish him is to
deprive him of danger.

                                GUICHE.

Woman! Woman! No one but a woman would think of such a scheme!

     (_getting closer to Roxane_).

You have then some regard for me? (_She smiles._) The fact that you take
sides with me, Roxane, is, in my eyes, a proof of love.

                                ROXANE.

It is one.

               GUICHE (_showing several sealed papers_).

I have the orders here for every company, and they shall be sent
immediately, except....

     (_he takes one out of the batch_) this one! It is for the cadets,
     and (_puts it into a pocket_)

I hold it back! Ha! ha! Cyrano....so eager for the fray! And so you play
with people as with mice, Roxane?

                                ROXANE.

Sometimes!

                     GUICHE (_quite close to her_).

You enthrall me! Roxane, listen. To-night--yes, I know, I must depart.
But leave you when I feel that you are moved!....I cannot. Hear me!
Close by here is the convent of the Capuchin fathers. Laymen cannot
enter it; but, as the fathers serve my uncle Richelieu, they have some
regard for his nephew, and they will give me a place of concealment.
Officially, I shall have left for the front, but I shall return to you
under the cover of a mask. Allow me to delay my departure a few hours,
dear waywardness!

                                ROXANE.

But if you are discovered! Your reputation....

                                GUICHE.

I'll risk it.

                                ROXANE.

But the siege.... Arras....

                                GUICHE.

I care not. Grant me your permission!

                                ROXANE.

No!

                                GUICHE.

Do!

                       ROXANE (_affectionately_).

My duty says that I must forbid! I beseech you, go!

                                                              (_aside_).

Christian remains here!

                                                              (_aloud_).

I would have you be a hero--Antoine!

                                GUICHE.

Celestial word!--And so you love the one....

                                ROXANE.

For whom I tremble? Yes!

                         GUICHE (_enraptured_).

'Tis well, I leave!

     (_Kisses her hand._)

Are you satisfied?

                                ROXANE.

Yes, dearest friend!

     (_Exit Guiche._)

           THE DUENNA (_curtseying mockingly behind Guiche_).

Yes, dearest friend.

                         ROXANE (_to Duenna_).

Not a word, if you please. Cyrano would never forgive me for stealing
his war from him!

     (_calling toward the house_).

Cousin!


                              _SCENE III._

                      ROXANE, THE DUENNA, CYRANO.

          ROXANE (_pointing to door of house opposite hers_).

We are going to Clomire's. Alcandre is to speak, so is Lysimon.

                                DUENNA.

Yes, but my little finger says that we shall be late.

                                CYRANO.

Make haste lest you miss part of their monkey talk.

                     DUENNA (_looking at knocker_).

That's right, they have gagged this noisy little wretch. It might have
interrupted the finest speeches.

     (_She knocks very gently. Door opens._)

                ROXANE (_about to pass in. To Cyrano_).

Were Christian to come, as is likely, request him to wait for me,
please.

                                CYRANO.

I shall.

     (_As she is passing in the door, she turns, on hearing Cyrano
     speak._)

And what question do you intend, as is your wont, to propound to him
to-day?

                                ROXANE.

The question of....

                          CYRANO (_eagerly_).

Of?....

                                ROXANE.

But you'll remain silent!

                                CYRANO.

As a prison wall.

                                ROXANE.

No question at all!.... I shall simply say to him: Proceed--without a
rein!--Extemporise. Speak of love. Be grand!

                          CYRANO (_smiling_).

Excellent idea!

                                ROXANE.

Hush!

                                CYRANO.

Hush!

     (_Roxane enters, closing the door._)

                     CYRANO (_bowing to the door_).

Very many thanks!

     (_The door opens and Roxane passes out her head._)

                                ROXANE.

He might try to prepare!....

                                CYRANO.

That would never do!....

                               TOGETHER.

Hush!

     (_Door closes._)

                          CYRANO (_calling_).

Christian!


                              _SCENE IV._

                           CYRANO, CHRISTIAN.

                                CYRANO.

Now I'm informed! Prepare your memory. There is glory in store for
you.--Drop your bad humour, and let us haste to your house, where I
shall coach you.

                               CHRISTIAN.

No!

                                CYRANO.

What!

                               CHRISTIAN.

I'll wait for Roxane here.

                                CYRANO.

Have you gone mad? Come, come!

                               CHRISTIAN.

No! I said. I am weary of committing to memory my letters, my
speeches.... Weary of playing a part....weary of trembling lest I fail!
All good and well in the beginning! But now I feel that she really loves
me! Many thanks, I fear nothing now. I'll speak unprompted.

                                CYRANO.

So, indeed!

                               CHRISTIAN.

Probably you think that I cannot?.... After all, I'm not so stupid! You
shall see! Your lessons have improved me. I'll speak unaided. And--speak
or not--I'll know enough to clasp her in my arms!

     (_Perceiving Roxane coming out of Clomire's house_).

It is she! Cyrano, for pity's sake, do not leave me!

                       CYRANO (_bowing to him_).

You'll speak unprompted, Sir.

     (_He disappears behind the garden wall._)


                               _SCENE V._

               CHRISTIAN, ROXANE, THE DUENNA, _a moment_.

           ROXANE (_coming out of Clomire's house, in company
              with several ladies and gentlemen.--Curtsies_).

Barthénoïde!--Alcandre--Grémione!....

                         DUENNA (_in despair_).

We missed the discourse on The Tender Passion!

     (_Enters house of Roxane._)

                   ROXANE (_going up to Christian_).

Oh! here you are!.... Twilight is coming, the air is balmy, and there is
nobody about. Let us be seated. Speak. I'm listening.

     (_She takes a seat on the bench. Christian sits near her.
     Silence._)

                               CHRISTIAN.

I love you!

                      ROXANE (_closing her eyes_).

Yes, speak of love!

                               CHRISTIAN.

I love thee!

                                ROXANE.

Yes, that is the theme. Amplify!

                               CHRISTIAN.

I love....

                                ROXANE.

Expatiate!

                               CHRISTIAN.

So deeply!....

                                ROXANE.

Of course.... and then?....

                               CHRISTIAN.

And then?.... I should feel so happy if you loved me! Roxane, do say
that you love me!

                          ROXANE (_pouting_).

You offer me porridge when I expected cream! Now, say _how_ you love me.

                               CHRISTIAN.

I love you....very much.

                                ROXANE.

Uncloud your sentiments a little!

                               CHRISTIAN.

Your neck! Ah! that I could press my lips to it!

                                ROXANE.

Christian, for shame!

                               CHRISTIAN.

I love you!

                       ROXANE (_about to rise_).

Again!

                     CHRISTIAN (_restraining her_).

No! I do _not_ love you....

                ROXANE (_settling again into her seat_).

That is better!

                               CHRISTIAN.

I adore you!

                 ROXANE (_rising and from a distance_).

Oh! the same thing!

                               CHRISTIAN.

Yes--I feel that I am getting stupid!

                                ROXANE.

Yes, and it displeases me. No more should I like to have you lose your
good looks.

                               CHRISTIAN.

But....

                                ROXANE.

Come, call up all your eloquence, just now put to flight.

                               CHRISTIAN.

I....

                                ROXANE.

Yes, I know, you love me. Farewell!

     (_She goes toward the door._)

                               CHRISTIAN.

Do not go! Let me tell you....

                      ROXANE (_opening her door_).

That you adore me?.... But I know it already. No! no! you had better
leave me!

                               CHRISTIAN.

But hear me, Roxane....

     (_She closes the door in his face._)

          CYRANO (_who has just appeared without being seen_).

Quite a success!


                              _SCENE VI._

               CHRISTIAN, CYRANO, THE PAGES, _a moment_.

                               CHRISTIAN.

Help! help!

                                CYRANO.

No, Sir!

                               CHRISTIAN.

I'll die if she does not this moment relent....

                                CYRANO.

What can I do? This very moment drum into you....

                  CHRISTIAN (_clasping Cyrano's arm_).

See! There she comes!

     (_Light in the balcony window._)

                           CYRANO (_moved_).

Her window!

                               CHRISTIAN.

Help me! Or I'll die!

                                CYRANO.

Speak lower!

                       CHRISTIAN (_whispering_).

It is life or death to me!

                                CYRANO.

The night is dark....

                               CHRISTIAN.

Well, speak!

                                CYRANO.

The harm can be undone. You do not deserve it, you wretch!....but stand
there before the balcony! I'll remain beneath it--and prompt you!

                               CHRISTIAN.

But, my friend....

                                CYRANO.

Obey orders!

                 THE PAGES (_in the rear, to Cyrano_).

Hep!

                       CYRANO (_silencing them_).

Hush!

                      FIRST PAGE (_in a whisper_).

We have serenaded Montfleury.

               CYRANO (_in a whisper, quickly to Pages_).

You, stand on this corner....and you, on that one. If anyone comes
along, play an air.

                              SECOND PAGE.

What sort of air would suit Gassendi?

                                CYRANO.

Lively for a woman; for a man a sad one!

     (_Pages disappear, taking two different streets._)

(_To Christian_) Now, call her!

                         CHRISTIAN (_calling_).

Roxane.

            CYRANO (_picking up a few pebbles that he throws
                against the window_).

Wait! A few pebbles.

                  ROXANE (_half opening her window_).

Who calls me?

                               CHRISTIAN.

I.

                                ROXANE.

Who is I?

                               CHRISTIAN.

I, Christian.

                         ROXANE (_scornfully_).

Oh! you!

                               CHRISTIAN.

I must speak to you.

              CYRANO (_under the balcony, to Christian_).

Good! Lower your voice.

                                ROXANE.

No! You speak too clumsily. Better go!

                               CHRISTIAN.

Be pitiful!....

                                ROXANE.

No! You love me no more!

                   CHRISTIAN (_prompted by Cyrano_).

You accuse me....merciful Gods!....of loving no more....when....I love
more!

       ROXANE (_stopping as she was going to close the window_).

Why! you are improving.

                     CHRISTIAN (_still prompted_).

Love grows stronger in the restless soul--mine--that he has
chosen....cruel child!....for a cradle!

                 ROXANE (_coming out on the balcony_).

Better still!....But, since this love is so cruel, you were foolish,
indeed, not to smother it at its birth!

                        CHRISTIAN (_prompted_).

I tried....but without success: this new-born babe, Madam, is a little
Hercules.

                                ROXANE.

Still better!

                        CHRISTIAN (_prompted_).

In fact, he....strangled without an effort....two serpents....Pride
and....Doubt....

               ROXANE (_leaning on the balcony railing_).

Very good indeed! But why do you speak so....deliberately? Has your
imagination the gout, that it limps so?

           CYRANO (_drawing Christian under the balcony, and
                noiselessly taking Christian's place before it_).

Hush! The task is getting too difficult!....

                                ROXANE.

To-night you waver in your speech. Why so?

              CYRANO (_speaking in a low tone as Christian
                  did before him_).

Because night has come, and, in the dark, my words must wander in search
of your ear.

                                ROXANE.

But my words meet with no such difficulty.

                                CYRANO.

Yours find a resting-place immediately. Oh! very naturally, since I
receive them into my heart. Remember that my heart is large, while your
ear is very small. Moreover, your words descend! thus have they speed.
While mine must rise, Madam: they require more time!

                                ROXANE.

But they have been rising much better for the last few moments.

                                CYRANO.

They are getting trained to climbing!

                                ROXANE.

The fact is that I am speaking to you from quite a height!

                                CYRANO.

Assuredly, and you would kill me if, from such an elevation, you allowed
a sharp word to drop upon my heart!

                           ROXANE (_moved_).

I'll come down.

                          CYRANO (_quickly_).

No!

       ROXANE (_pointing to the stone bench under the balcony_).

Step upon the bench, then, and climb up here!

                 CYRANO (_frightened and retreating_).

No!

                                ROXANE.

You surprise me.... Why not?

                    CYRANO (_more and more moved_).

Let us rather improve.... this opportunity of.... speaking softly
together.... without seeing each other.

                                ROXANE.

What! To each other almost invisible?

                                CYRANO.

  As now.--Let us enjoy the bliss there is
  In seeking to distinguish one the other.
  For you, I'm but the darkness of a cloak;
  For me, you are the whiteness of a robe.
  I'm shadow only, you are blessèd light!

If ever you have thought me eloquent....

                                ROXANE.

I have.

                                CYRANO.

Remember now that my words never yet came from my true heart.

                                ROXANE.

Why not?

                                CYRANO.

Because.... until now.... I have spoken to you through....

                                ROXANE.

Through what?

                                CYRANO.

The spell that you cast upon those who bask in the light of your
eyes!.... And so, this night, to me it seems as if I were about to speak
to you for the first time!

                                ROXANE.

Ah! that is why your voice seems different.

       CYRANO (_feverish, and coming up closer to the balcony_).

Yes, different; for, now that darkness shields me, I dare to be myself
at last, I dare....

     (_He stops, bewildered._)

Where was I?.... I forget.... Pardon my confusion.... All this is so
exquisite.... so new to me!....

                                ROXANE.

So new!

          CYRANO (_quite bewildered, and trying to explain_).

So new!.... Why! yes.... It's new to be sincere. And then.... a fear of
ridicule....

                                ROXANE.

Ridicule? For what?

                                CYRANO.

My emotional flights!

  My heart, through diffidence, forever calls
  Upon my mind to shield it from disdain:
  I start to cull a star, and then I halt,
  For fear of ridicule, to pick a floret.

                                ROXANE.

  A floret has its charms.

                                CYRANO.

                                Disdain them now!

                                ROXANE.

  You never spoke to me as now you speak!

                                CYRANO.

  Oh! let us set aside the pygmy things,
  The superannuated niceties
  Of love as it is understood to-day!
  Why sip by drops the waters of a spring,
  When from a river we can freely quaff?

                                ROXANE.

  But mind and wit?

                                CYRANO.

                   They serve to make you stay.
  But now 'twould be an insult to the night,
  To fragrance, and to fate, and nature too,
  If we should hold unto affected style.
  One look above, and artifice disarms!
  I fear that, with this subtle alchemy,
  The truth of sentiment might vapourise,
  The soul exhaust itself in futile play,
  And niceties be carried to a point
  So pointed that it end in nothingness!

                                ROXANE.

  But mind and wit?

                                CYRANO.

                    I hate them now. It is
  A crime to force sweet love to bandy words!
  There comes a time, moreover, be assured--
  Oh! how I pity those who feel it not!--
  When our breast o'erflows with noble love,
  A love that pretty words must desecrate!

                                ROXANE.

  Since now for both of us the time has come,
  What words shall I expect from you?

                                CYRANO.

                                      All, all,
  All those I know; accept them scattered loose,
  Unsought, unbound. I love you--let me breathe!--
  I love thee[20], and I rave. 'Tis joy too much!
  Thy name is in my heart as in a bell,
  Roxane, and, as my heart forever throbs,
  The bell is e'er the sounder of thy name.
  Of thee there's nought I do not hoard and love:
  I mind me that, last year, the twelfth of May,
  A twist was changed in what's a crown, thy hair!
  Thy glowing hair to me is truly light.
  When we have gazed too long upon the sun,
  We see on things around a halo reign;
  'Tis thus when I have lost the light thou shedst:
  My dazzled eyes are filled with golden sparks!

                                ROXANE.

  Yes, this is love--

                                CYRANO.

                      The passion in my heart
  Is jealous, fierce, with sadness tainted, but
  It's really love--love shorn of selfish thought.
  Would I could give my happiness for thine--
  E'en shouldst thou ne'er suspect whose gift it was--
  If I could hear, perchance and from afar,
  The music of thy bliss, my offering!
  From every glance of thine fresh virtue springs,
  Fresh valour, too. Oh! say I'm understood,
  And that thou feelst my soul ascend to thee!
  All is to-night too beautiful and sweet!
  And still it's true! I speak, at last, to thee.
  Yes, I to thee! 'Tis bliss too great! My hopes,
  My wildest hopes ne'er leaped to such a height;
  My dream's no dream, and I can die content.
  Because of me she quivers with the trees!
  For, leaf divine, you tremble with the leaves!
  Thou tremblest, for, against thy will or not,
  I feel, oh, bliss! the tremour of thy hand
  Descending now along these flowery vines.

     (_He imprints a passionate kiss upon one of the branches._)

                                ROXANE.

  I tremble, yes; I weep, I love, I'm thine!
  I am enthralled!

                                CYRANO.

                  May Death then come along,
  Since rapture's born of me, of me alone!
  What more can I expect of life?--

                    CHRISTIAN (_under the balcony_).

                                     A kiss!

                        ROXANE (_falling back_).

What?

                                CYRANO.

          Oh!

                                ROXANE.

                  You claim?--

                                CYRANO.

                                   Yes--I--

                                   (_aside to Christian_).

                                                         You go too far.

                     CHRISTIAN (_aside to Cyrano_).

Now she is moved, it's time for me to act.

                         CYRANO (_to Roxane_).

Yes, I.... I asked.... it is true.... but now I realise how more than
bold I was.

                   ROXANE (_somewhat disappointed_).

And you do not insist?

                                CYRANO.

Insist? Of course I do.... but with reserve!.... Yes, I know your
modesty's offended. So, I withdraw the kiss.... refuse it to me!

              CHRISTIAN (_with a tug at Cyrano's cloak_).

Why so?

                                CYRANO.

Be silent, Christian!

                  ROXANE (_leaning over the balcony_).

What are you muttering?

                                CYRANO.

I was reproving myself for going too far. I was saying: be silent
Christian!....

     (_sound of archlute._)

                                  One moment please!.... Some one comes.

     (_Roxane closes her window. Cyrano listens to the archlutes; one of
     them plays a lively air, and the other a sad one._)

Lively?.... Sad?.... A woman or a man? No, a monk!

     (_Enter monk holding a lighted lantern. He goes from house to
     house, looking at the doors._)

  [20] Note.--In this tirade, and in the following one, _you_, _thou_
       and _she_ are intentionally interwoven. When Cyrano is carried by
       his emotion, he passes from _you_ to _thou_, which latter is, in
       French, familiar and endearing much more than in English. Then,
       reclaimed by reason and fearing that he has overstepped the
       bounds, he returns to the (in French) more formal _you_, or
       resorts to a discreet _she_, only to forget himself again and to
       resume the caressing _thou_.


                              _SCENE VII._

                 CYRANO, CHRISTIAN, _a_ CAPUCHIN MONK.

                        CYRANO (_to the Monk_).

Are you a new Diogenes?

                                 MONK.

I'm looking for the house of Madam Magdeleine Robin.

               CYRANO (_pointing to one of the streets_).

That way--straight ahead--as far as you can go....

                                 MONK.

Thank you, Sir!--I'll tell my beads for you.

                                                          (_Exit Monk._)

                                CYRANO.

Peace be with you! I bid you Godspeed!

     (_Comes down toward Christian._)


                             _SCENE VIII._

                           CYRANO, CHRISTIAN.

                               CHRISTIAN.

Obtain for me that kiss!

                                CYRANO.

No, Sir!

                               CHRISTIAN.

But, sooner or later, you know....

                                CYRANO.

  True,
  The time will come, that time of bliss intense,
  When each will fall into the other's arms,
  And blond mustache to rosy lips will go!

     (_aside_)

'Twas better that at least I cause the bliss.

     (_Window above opens. Christian conceals himself beneath the
     balcony._)


                              _SCENE IX._

                       CYRANO, CHRISTIAN, ROXANE.

                 ROXANE (_coming out on the balcony_).

Is it you?--Yes.... What were we speaking of?.... oh! of a.... well,
of....

                                CYRANO.

  A kiss! The word is soft. Why hesitate?
  The name, be sure, will not maltreat your lips,
  However burning be the thing itself.--
  Just now, you left the trifling mood, to glide,
  To steal from smile to sigh, and sigh to tears.
  Glide on!.... From tear to kiss there's but a thrill!

                                ROXANE.

  Be silent!

                                CYRANO.

            After all, what is a kiss?
  An oath that's given closer than before;
  A promise more precise; the sealing of
  Confessions that till then were barely breathed;
  A ruby O to spell the verb: I love![21]
  A secret that's confided to a mouth
  And not to ears; a precious moment of
  Infinity that buzzes like a bee;
  Communion with the fragrance flowers have;
  A gentle way for heart to breathe a heart,
  For soul from fervid lips to drink a soul!

                                ROXANE.

  Be still!

                                CYRANO.

            A kiss is oft a thing so grand
  That once a queen of France permitted one
  Unto a happy lord. I said: a queen!

                                ROXANE.

  And then?

                          CYRANO (_excited_).

            Like Buckingham, I've suffered long;
  Like him I love a queen, the one that's you!
  Like him, I'm sad and faithful....

                                ROXANE.

                                And like him
  You've beauty.

                       CYRANO (_aside, abashed_).

                Yes.... I've beauty.... I forgot!

                                ROXANE.

  Well, then, come up, to cull the flower....

            CYRANO (_pushing Christian toward the balcony_).

                                           Go!

                                ROXANE.

  Whose fragrance....

                        CYRANO (_to Christian_).

                      Go!

                                ROXANE.

                          The buzzing of the bee....

                        CYRANO (_to Christian_).

  Go up!

                       CHRISTIAN (_hesitating_).

         But now, it really seems a crime!

                                ROXANE.

  A moment of infinity....

                     CYRANO (_pushing Christian_).

                               You fool,
  Go up!

     (_Christian, by aid of bench, vines and posts, reaches the balcony
     and steps over the railing._)

                               CHRISTIAN.

          Roxane!....

     (_He clasps her to his breast and kisses her on the lips._)

                           CYRANO (_aside_).

                      What pinches so my heart?....
  That kiss!.... a feast where I'm the Lazarus!....
  Sweet feast, from thee there falls to me a crumb,
  Since on the lips Roxane mistakes, alas!
  She drinks the words that I just now pronounced!

                                               (_Sound of instruments._)

An air that's sad, a lively air!--The Monk!

     (_Affecting to run as if coming from a distance. In clear tone:_)

Hello!

                                ROXANE.

What is it?

                                CYRANO.

It is I, Cyrano. I was passing.... Is Christian still here?

                    CHRISTIAN (_as if astonished_).

Why! it's Cyrano!

                                ROXANE.

How do you do, cousin?

                                CYRANO.

Cousin, how do you do?

                                ROXANE.

I'll come down.

     (_She disappears into the house. By the rear, enter the Monk._)

                     CHRISTIAN (_perceiving him_).

What! he again!

     (_He follows Roxane._)

  [21] Note.--"Un point rose qu'on met sur l'i du verbe aimer."

       "A ruby O"...., as above, may prove, it is thought, a good
       example of _equivalence_, the _i_, impossible here in English,
       finding in O a good substitute, calling up, if not exactly the
       very same image, at least a kindred one fully as good.


                               _SCENE X._

            CYRANO, CHRISTIAN, ROXANE, THE MONK, RAGUENEAU.

                               THE MONK.

She must live here--I insist--Magdeleine Robin!

                                CYRANO.

Why! You said _Ro-lin_.

                                 MONK.

No! _Bin_. B, I, N, _bin_!

              ROXANE (_appears in the doorway, followed by
                  Ragueneau, carrying a lighted lantern,
                  and by Christian_).

What is it?

                                 MONK.

A letter.

                               CHRISTIAN.

What's this?

                          MONK (_to Roxane_).

Oh! it can but be a saintly thing! A worthy gentleman....

                        ROXANE (_to Christian_).

Evidently Guiche!

                               CHRISTIAN.

He would dare?....

                                ROXANE.

Oh! he cannot long annoy me! I love you, and....

     (_She opens the letter, and, by the aid of Ragueneau's lantern, she
     reads to herself, in a low voice:_)

"Mademoiselle,

"The drums are beating and my regiment is about to start. All think that
I have already gone; but I have remained, thus disobeying you. I am here
in the convent. I'll come to you forthwith, but I give you notice of my
visit, through an innocent monk who knows not what message he is
carrying. Your lips smiled to me just now; I must see them again.
Dismiss whoever is near you, and condescend to hear the bold suitor whom
you have, I trust, already forgiven, and who remains your most.... et
cetera...."

     (_to the Monk_).

Father, listen! Here is what the letter says:

     (_All come up and listen, as she reads aloud:_)

"Mademoiselle,

"You must submit to the will of the Cardinal, however hard it may appear
to you. And that is why I send this message by a saintly, most
intelligent and discreet capuchin. We desire you to receive his
blessing....(_turning the page_) his nuptial blessing immediately.
Christian must be married to you secretly. I send him to you, though I
know you like him not. Be resigned, remembering that Heaven will bless
your zeal. Be assured, Mademoiselle, of my respect, for I have been and
shall ever be your most humble and very.... et cetera."

                          MONK (_delighted_).

Worthy gentleman! I knew he could suggest but a saintly thing!

                     ROXANE (_aside to Christian_).

Do you not think I read letters well?

                               CHRISTIAN.

It depends....

                     ROXANE (_aloud, in despair_).

Ah!.... this is terrible!

        MONK (_throwing the light of the lantern upon Cyrano_).

Are you the groom?

                               CHRISTIAN.

I am the one!

             MONK (_turning the light upon Christian and as
                if he was in doubt on seeing Christian's
                handsome looks_).

But, my son....

                          ROXANE (_eagerly_).

There is a Post Scriptum: "Donate to the convent one hundred and twenty
pistoles."

                                 MONK.

Worthy, worthy gentleman! (_To Roxane_) Be resigned!

                    ROXANE (_with a martyr's look_).

I am!

     (_While Ragueneau shows the Monk into the house, on Christian's
     invitation, Roxane, in low tone, says to Cyrano_).

Guiche is coming. Detain him here until....

                                CYRANO.

I understand.

     (_to the Monk_). To give them your blessing will take you.... how
long?

                                 MONK.

A quarter of an hour.

              CYRANO (_pushing them all into the house_).

Go in, go in! Only one must remain here: I!

                        ROXANE (_to Christian_).

Come!

     (_They all go into the house._)

                                CYRANO.

How can I detain Guiche fifteen minutes? Oh! I have a plan!

     (_He climbs upon the balcony. The archlutes play a sort of dirge._)

This time it must be a man, most certainly. It is!

     (_He is on the balcony, with his hat well down over his eyes. Takes
     off his sword, wraps himself in his cloak, leans over the railing
     and observes._)

No! Really not too high!

     (_Straddles the railing, seizes a long branch of one of the trees
     and makes ready to drop._)

I'll only slightly disturb the atmosphere!


                              _SCENE XI._

                            CYRANO, GUICHE.

             GUICHE (_masked, and hesitating in the dark_).

What can this infernal monk be doing?

                                CYRANO.

By the way--my voice?--He might recognise it!

     (_He loosens a hand and makes the motion of turning a key._)

Cric! Crac!

     (_Solemnly_) Now, Cyrano, resume the accent of Bergerac!

                    GUICHE (_looking at the house_).

Here's the house!

     (_He is about to enter, but Cyrano springs from the balcony while
     holding on to the branch; the latter bends and lets him down
     between Guiche and the door. He affects to fall heavily, as if from
     a great height, remaining crushed and dazed. Guiche jumps back._)

What is this?

     (_When Guiche recovers from his astonishment the branch has sprung
     up again, so that Cyrano appears to have fallen from the sky._)

From where did this man drop?

              CYRANO (_speaking with a Gascon's accent_).

From the moon!

                                GUICHE.

The moon!....

                        CYRANO (_as if dazed_).

What time is it? What country is this? What month? What day?

                                GUICHE.

But, my dear Sir....

                                CYRANO.

I feel quite dizzy.--Like a bombshell, I have just dropped from the
moon!

                      GUICHE (_out of patience_).

Look here, Sir!....

               CYRANO (_rising, and in thundering tone_).

I say that I dropped!

                        GUICHE (_falling back_).

So be it, then! You dropped!.... (_aside_) He is no doubt insane!

                     CYRANO (_walking toward him_).

And my drop is not metaphorical!.... One hundred years, or one minute
ago--I cannot tell how long I was on the way--I was up in that
saffron-coloured ball!

                  GUICHE (_shrugging his shoulders_).

Quite so! But allow me to pass!

                        CYRANO (_stopping him_).

Be frank now! Where am I? Where have I fallen like a meteorite?

                                GUICHE.

Zounds, Sir!....

                                CYRANO.

During my fall, I could make no selection as to my point of arrival. Is
it upon a moon or an earth that my dead weight has just landed?

                                GUICHE.

But I repeat to you, Sir!....

            CYRANO (_with a cry of horror that causes Guiche
                to fall back_).

Good Heavens!.... In this country are people's faces black? Am I in
Algiers, and are you a native?

                     GUICHE (_touching his mask_).

No doubt, this mask....

                 CYRANO (_seemingly less frightened_).

Oh! then, it's Venice.... or Genoa!

                       GUICHE (_trying to pass_).

A lady is waiting for me!...

                    CYRANO (_completely reassured_).

Then I must be in Paris!

                    GUICHE (_reluctantly smiling_).

The rascal is amusing!

                                CYRANO.

You are laughing.

                                GUICHE.

Yes,--but I must pass.

                    CYRANO (_apparently overjoyed_).

So I have dropped in Paris!....

     (_Quite at his ease, laughing, dusting himself, and bowing._)

I have just arrived--pardon me--by the last cyclone, and I must brush
off the ether that is still on me. I've travelled! My eyes are still
full of astral dust, and my spurs have caught planet hairs.

     (_picking something off his sleeve_).

Here, on my doublet, is one from a comet!....

     (_He blows, as if to cast off the hair._)

                          GUICHE (_enraged_).

Now, look here, Sir!....

     (_As Guiche is going to pass, Cyrano stretches out his leg as if to
     show something that is on it._)

                                CYRANO.

In the calf of this leg, Sir, I have a tooth of the Great Bear,--and, as
nearing the Trident, I managed to avoid its three lances, I fell in a
lump upon the Balance--where my weight up there is still registered!

     (_preventing Guiche from passing and holding him by one of his
     buttons._)

If you were to press my nose, Sir, you would cause a flow of milk!....

                                GUICHE.

Milk, indeed!

                                CYRANO.

Yes, Sir.... from the Milky Way!

                                GUICHE.

Oh! by Satan!....

                                CYRANO.

No! I dropped from heaven! (_crossing his arms_). Would you believe it?
I noticed it as I was going by there: Sirius, at night actually wears a
turban! (_confidentially_) The other Bear, the little one, is still too
small to bite! (_laughing_) As I was passing through the Lyre, I broke
one of its strings! (_proudly_) But I intend to write a book on the
subject; and the golden stars that I gathered into my scorched cloak,
regardless of peril, shall be used by my printer for asterisks!

                                GUICHE.

Once more, I must insist....

                                CYRANO.

Oh! Sir, I know what you desire!

                                GUICHE.

You do?....

                                CYRANO.

Yes. You desire to hear from me how the moon is made, and if any one
inhabits the rotundity of this cucurbit![22]

                         GUICHE (_very loud_).

No! No! I desire....

                                CYRANO.

To learn how I got up there? Easily. Through an invention of mine.

                        GUICHE (_discouraged_).

A madman, certainly!

                        CYRANO (_disdainfully_).

I copied not the stupid eagle of Regiomontanus, or the timid pigeon of
Archytas!....

                                GUICHE.

A madman--but a learned one.

                                CYRANO.

No, Sir. I imitated nothing ever done.

     (_Guiche, having managed to pass, is nearing Roxane's door, but
     Cyrano follows, ready to seize him._)

I invented six different ways of assaulting the virgin blue!

                          GUICHE (_turning_).

Six?

                   CYRANO (_with increased fluency_).

I could, with body as bare as a taper, have comparisoned it with crystal
phials o'erflowing with tears from the morning skies, and my person,
then, if exposed in the sun, would have been aspirated by the luminary
along with the dew!

               GUICHE (_astonished, goes toward Cyrano_).

True! That is one way!

          CYRANO (_backing, so as to draw him further away_).

Again, I could have created a powerful gust of wind, to lift me, if I
had rarefied the air in a cedar box, by means of heated mirrors forming
an icosahedron!

                      GUICHE (_following Cyrano_).

Two ways!

                       CYRANO (_still backing_).

Or else, being both a machinist and an artificer, have straddled a
steel-legged grasshopper, and caused myself, through successive
explosions of saltpetre, to be projected into the azure fields where the
stars are wont to graze!

             GUICHE (_still following him, and counting on
                  his fingers_).

That is three!

                                CYRANO.

Since smoke persists in rising, I might have blown into a globe enough
of it to carry me up!

                  GUICHE (_more and more astonished_).

Four!

                                CYRANO.

Since Phoebe, when her bow is the thinnest, loves to draw, O beeves!
your marrow,.... anoint myself with the same!

                         GUICHE (_stupefied_).

Five!

              CYRANO (_who has managed, while talking, to
                  press Guiche over to the other side of
                  the square, near a bench_).

Last: I could have placed myself upon an iron plate, taken a magnet and
thrown it up into the air! This is a capital way. As soon as the magnet
starts, the iron rushes in pursuit of it. The magnet is thrown up again;
the iron plate follows--and, Cadedis! there is nothing to prevent the
ascension from lasting indefinitely.

                                GUICHE.

Six!--All excellent systems. And, tell me, Sir, which one of the six did
you adopt?

                                CYRANO.

A seventh one!

                                GUICHE.

Astonishing! And what was it, please?

                                CYRANO.

You would never dream of it!....

                           GUICHE (_aside_).

The fellow is really interesting!

               CYRANO (_very mysterious and imitating the
                  sound of waves on a beach_).

Houüh! Houüh!

                                GUICHE.

What's that?

                                CYRANO.

You cannot imagine?

                                GUICHE.

No!

                                CYRANO.

The tide!.... As it was running out, in obedience to the attraction of
the moon, I lay on the sands--head foremost, so that my hair--hair, you
know, does not dry fast--so that my hair was kept bathed in the receding
waves. And, thus I was, by the moon's attraction, drawn up, up, erect,
like an angel. And up I went, gently, without an effort, until suddenly,
I felt a shock!.... Then!....

           GUICHE (_interested, takes a seat on the bench_).

Then?....

                                CYRANO.

Then.... (_resuming his natural tone_). The fifteen minutes have
elapsed, Sir, and now I grant you your freedom. The marriage is
accomplished!

                         GUICHE (_jumping up_).

Am I intoxicated?.... That voice!

     (_The door of Roxane's house opens; lackeys come out with lighted
     candelabra. Cyrano takes off his hat that he had kept well down
     over his face._)

And that nose!.... Cyrano!

                           CYRANO (_bowing_).

In person.... Cyrano! They have just exchanged their marriage rings.

                                GUICHE.

They!.... Who?

     (_He turns. Tableau. Behind the lackeys, Roxane and Christian
     holding each other by the hand. The Monk, smiling, follows them.
     Ragueneau is behind, also holding a light. And last is the Duenna,
     bewildered, half dressed, as if she had been hurried out of bed._)

Merciful heavens!

  [22] Note.--_Cucurbit_ ("cucurbite") for moon is, in French, as odd as
       it appears in English. The oddity of the expression, that
       assimulates Luna to the rotund melon, pumpkin, etc., of the genus
       of plants known as _cucurbita_, is in keeping with Cyrano's
       intentional extravagance of speech.


                              _SCENE XII._

_The same._ ROXANE, CHRISTIAN, THE MONK, RAGUENEAU, LACKEYS, THE DUENNA.

                         GUICHE (_to Roxane_).

You, Roxane!

     (_Astounded on recognising Christian_) and he?

     (_Bowing admiringly to Roxane._)

You are admirably shrewd!

     (_To Cyrano_) My compliments to you, Sir, as an inventor. Your
narrative would have stopped a saint at the gate of heaven! Do not
forget to write that book!

                           CYRANO (_bowing_).

I promise, Sir, to follow your advice.

             THE MONK (_with an air of satisfaction calling
                  Guiche's attention to the two lovers_).

A beautiful couple, my son, and good work of yours!

                        GUICHE (_very coldly_).

Yes.

     (_to Roxane_) Be good enough to bid farewell, Madam, to your
husband.

                                ROXANE.

How so?

                        GUICHE (_to Christian_).

Your regiment is about to march. Join it immediately!

                                ROXANE.

Is it going to the war?

                                GUICHE.

Of course it is.

                                ROXANE.

But you said, Sir, that the Cadets were not going!

                                GUICHE.

They shall go!

     (_Drawing from his pocket the paper he had put into it._)

Here is the order.

     (_to Christian_) Bear it yourself, Baron.

        ROXANE (_throwing herself into the arms of Christian_).

Oh! dear Christian!

                    GUICHE (_chuckling, to Cyrano_).

A still very distant honeymoon!

                           CYRANO (_aside_).

A fact not so annoying to me as he thinks!

                        CHRISTIAN (_to Roxane_).

Another kiss! Your lips again!

                                CYRANO.

Come, that is enough! enough!

                  CHRISTIAN (_still kissing Roxane_).

It is very hard to leave her.... You do not know....

               CYRANO (_endeavouring to draw him away_).

Oh! yes, I do!

     (_Drums beating a march, in the distance._)

                GUICHE (_who has gone up to the rear_).

The troops are leaving!

           ROXANE (_to Cyrano, who is drawing away Christian
                while she is trying to hold him back_).

Oh!.... I entrust him to you! Promise me that nothing shall endanger his
life!

                                CYRANO.

I shall do my best.... but I can hardly promise....

               ROXANE (_still holding on to Christian_).

Promise me that he shall be very prudent!

                                CYRANO.

I'll try, but as to promising....

                      ROXANE (_still holding on_).

That during this terrible siege he shall never be cold!

                                CYRANO.

If it is at all possible, but....

                      ROXANE (_still holding on_).

That he shall remain true to me!

                                CYRANO.

Yes! of course! But I cannot....

                      ROXANE (_still holding on_).

That he shall write to me often!

                          CYRANO (_halting_).

Oh! that--I promise you!

                               _ACT IV._

                         THE CADETS OF GASCONY.


_The post occupied by the Company of Carbon of Haughty-Hall at the siege
of Arras. In the rear, an embankment running across the stage. Beyond, a
plain, extending as far as the horizon, covered with siege works. In the
distance, the walls of the City of Arras, with the outline of its roofs
against the sky. Tents; arms strewn around; drums, etc.--Day is about to
dawn; gold in the east. Sentinels here and there. Camp fires.--Rolled up
in their cloaks the Cadets of Gascony are sleeping. Carbon of
Haughty-Hall and Le Bret are watching. They are very pale and thin.
Christian is asleep, in front, his face lighted by a fire. Silence._


                               _SCENE I._

        CHRISTIAN, CARBON OF HAUGHTY-HALL, LE BRET, THE CADETS,
                            _later_ CYRANO.

                                LE BRET.

It's awful!

                                CARBON.

Yes, nothing left to eat.

                                LE BRET.

Mordious!

              CARBON (_motioning to him to speak lower_).

Deaden your oaths! or you'll wake the men.

                                                      (_to the Cadets_).

                                                               Sleep on!

     (_to Le Bret_).

He who sleeps eats!

                                LE BRET.

Yes, but waking starves!

     (_A few musket reports are heard in the distance._)

                                CARBON.

Confound the muskets!.... They'll wake up my children.

     (_to several of the Cadets who lift up their heads_).

Sleep!

     (_More musketry, nearer_).

                          A CADET (_tossing_).

The Devil! again?

                                CARBON.

It's nothing! Only Cyrano coming back!

     (_The lifted heads lie down again._)

                        A SENTINEL (_outside_).

Who goes there?

                          CYRANO (_outside_).

Bergerac!

                   A SENTINEL (_on the embankment_).

Ventrebieu! who goes there?

                                CYRANO.

Bergerac, you idiot!

     (_He comes down and is met by Le Bret._)

                                LE BRET.

What, you! wounded?

                      CYRANO (_raising his hand_).

Hush! You know that they miss me regularly every morning.

                                LE BRET.

What! risk your life thus, every day, just to carry a letter without the
camp! That is going too far.

               CYRANO (_stopping in front of Christian_).

I promised that he would write often!

                                    (_looking at him_).

                                    He sleeps. How pale!
  If sweet Roxane knew that he is starving! But he has not
  lost his good looks.

                                LE BRET.

Go get some sleep!

                                CYRANO.

Don't growl, Le Bret!.... Remember this: To pass through the Spanish
lines, I long ago selected a place where they are invariably drunk.

                                LE BRET.

Why don't you once bring back some provisions?

                                CYRANO.

A load would not leave me light enough to pass through. But there is
going to be a change. We, the French, shall soon eat.... or die,--if my
eyes did not deceive me....

                                LE BRET.

How soon?

                                CYRANO.

You'll see!.... I'm not sure enough to speak.

                                CARBON.

Isn't it shameful that the besiegers should be the ones to starve!

                                LE BRET.

An extraordinary siege this! We are besieging Arras, and the Spanish are
besieging us.

                                CYRANO.

Somebody should come now to besiege the Spanish.

                                LE BRET.

Do not joke so.--When I think that a life, precious as yours is, can be
risked daily just to carry....

     (_Cyrano walks toward one of the tents._)

                                   Where are you going?

                                CYRANO.

I am going to write another letter.

     (_Enters tent._)


                              _SCENE II._

                        _The same, less_ CYRANO.

_Day is dawning. Rosy tints in the sky, and golden ones on the distant
city. A gun is heard, then drums beat in the distance, to the left.
Other drums are heard, successively, nearer, and nearer, until they
sound on the stage, the noise then receding gradually, toward the right.
Awakening of the Camp. Officers' commands in the distance._

                          CARBON (_sighing_).

Reveille!.... Alas!

     (_the Cadets begin rising._)

Their dream of dinner is finished.... I know what their cry will be now.

                          A CADET (_rising_).

I'm hungry!

                             ANOTHER CADET.

I'm half dead!

                             OTHER CADETS.

We are dead! quite!

                                CARBON.

Get up!

                            SEVERAL CADETS.

Can't!

       FIRST CADET (_using his breastplate as a looking-glass_).

My tongue is yellow. Indigestion!

                             ANOTHER CADET.

As to me, if my gastric organ gets not wherewith to produce a pint of
chyle, I'll retire into my tent--like Achilles.

                            SEVERAL CADETS.

Bread! Something to eat! Now!

           CARBON (_going to the tent of Cyrano and speaking
                low to him_).

Cyrano, help! Come with your ready wit, and put some life into them.
Give them new courage.

            A CADET (_to another who is chewing something_).

What are you nibbling at?

                            THE OTHER CADET.

Cannon wad fried in axle grease! There is but little game around Arras.

                      ANOTHER CADET (_entering_).

I've been out shooting.

               STILL ANOTHER CADET (_likewise entering_).

And I've been fishing in the Scarpe.

                 ALL THE CADETS (_rushing up to them_).

What have you killed? What have you caught?--A pheasant?--A
carp?--Quick, quick, show them!

                             THE FISHERMAN.

A gudgeon!

                             THE HUNTSMAN.

A sparrow!

                    ALL THE CADETS (_exasperated_).

Enough, enough! too much!--let us mutiny!

                                CARBON.

Help, Cyrano.

     (_Daylight has come._)


                              _SCENE III._

                          _The same_, CYRANO.

            CYRANO (_leaving his tent, perfectly tranquil, a
                pen over his ear, book in hand_).

Hey!....

     (_Silence. To the first Cadet_).

                                 What makes you drag your feet along so?

                               THE CADET.

Something in my heels that should not be there!....

                                CYRANO.

What's that?

                               THE CADET.

My stomach!

                                CYRANO.

Mine's the same. What of it?

                               THE CADET.

Isn't it inconvenient?

                                CYRANO.

No, it heightens me.

                             SECOND CADET.

My teeth are very long.

                                CYRANO.

Well, you can bite off a larger piece.

                             ANOTHER CADET.

My skin sounds empty.

                                CYRANO.

We'll use it as a drum, for the charge.

                             ANOTHER CADET.

There is a humming in my ears.

                                CYRANO.

Not that; an empty stomach has no ears. Impossible!

                              OTHER CADET.

Oh! for something to eat,--with good oil!

            CYRANO (_taking off the helmet of the Cadet, in
                whose hand he places it_).

Eat your salad.

                             ANOTHER CADET.

What could we find to devour?

       CYRANO (_throwing to him the book he holds in his hand_).

The Iliad!

                              OTHER CADET.

Meanwhile, the Minister in Paris has his four meals a day!

                                CYRANO.

He ought certainly to send you at least a partridge.

                              SAME CADET.

Why not? And some wine with it too!

                                CYRANO.

Richelieu, some Burgundy, if you please!

                              SAME CADET.

By one of his capuchins!

                                CYRANO.

The Grey Eminence is so intoxicating!

                              OTHER CADET.

I'm as hungry as a bear!

                                CYRANO.

Well, bear it![23]

                FIRST CADET (_shrugging his shoulders_).

Forever words, a point!

                                CYRANO.

                           A point and words!
  'Tis true; and I should like to die--at eve,
  The sky aglow--as the defender of
  A noble cause, a soldier and a poet too,
  With, on my lips, the thrill of daring words,
  And in my heart a sword's ennobling point!

                                  ALL.

  We're hungry!

                     CYRANO (_crossing his arms_).

                  So--you think of naught but food!
  Come up here, then, Bertrandou, with your fife.
  Seek shepherds' notes, and let these gluttons feast
  Upon some old and ne'er forgotten tune
  Each sound of which is like a sister's voice;
  An air that slowly winds its way aloft,
  As does the smoke from lowly cottage roofs,
  A lay of youth, of waiting hearts and home!

     (_Bertrandou prepares his fife._)

  Let fife a while forget the battle note,
  Remembering that it was born a reed.

     (_Bertrandou begins playing some Gascony airs._)

  Ye Gascons, list! 'Tis war no more, but peace.
  'Tis hill and dale, 'tis wood and meadow-land,
  With red-capped lads beside their gentle herds;
  'Tis smiling riverbank and sunny sea.
  O Gascons, hark! You are in Gascony!

     (_All have bowed their heads and are dreaming: many brush away a
     tear._)

                      CARBON (_to Cyrano, aside_).

But, instead of giving them courage, you make them weep!

                                CYRANO.

I've made them homesick!.... A noble sort of suffering .... nobler than
hunger. It is a comfort to see their pain change organs, and pass from
their stomachs to their hearts!

                                CARBON.

But you will weaken them!

             CYRANO (_motioning to a drummer to come up_).

Never mind! The heroes' blood that is in them will soon arouse them!

     (_He motions to the drummer, who begins beating his drum._)

               ALL THE CADETS (_rushing to their arms_).

Hey!.... What?.... What is it?....

                     CYRANO (_smiling, to Carbon_).

You see that, at the sound of the drum, dreams, longings, thoughts of
home, of love,....all fly away. What comes by the fife goes by the
drum.[24]

                       A CADET (_from the rear_).

Ha! ha! here is Monsieur de Guiche!

                     ALL THE CADETS (_murmuring_).

Hou....

                          CYRANO (_smiling_).

Quite complimentary!

                                A CADET.

He is a bore, with his lace collar over his armour. He comes here to
exhibit himself!

                              OTHER CADET.

As if lace were in keeping with iron!

                              OTHER CADET.

Good if one has a boil on his neck!

                              OTHER CADET.

Too much of the courtier!

                              OTHER CADET.

The nephew of his uncle, the Cardinal.

                                CARBON.

And still he's a Gascon!

                              FIRST CADET.

Not a true one!....Beware! Because Gascons, you know, must be madcaps.
There is nothing more dangerous than a reasonable Gascon.

                                LE BRET.

How pale he is!

                                A CADET.

He is hungry.... Just as much as we poor devils. But his breastplate
gives a lustre to his cramps!

                          CYRANO (_quickly_).

We should not appear to suffer more than he does! Here! all of you, take
up your cards, your pipes and your dice....

     (_They all rapidly begin playing, on benches, drums, or on their
     cloaks spread out on the ground, meanwhile lighting long pipes._)

                                     .... and I ... will read Descartes.

     (_He walks up and down, reading a small book that he has taken out
     of his pocket.--Tableau.--Guiche enters; everybody seems busy and
     satisfied. He is very pale; goes up to Carbon._)

  [23] Note.--"Tu croques le marmot" (literally "you are eating the
       baby") is an allusion to ogres' proverbial taste for infants,
       coupled with the somewhat slangy meaning: "you are waiting long
       and impatiently." This in English would be meaningless, and was
       perforce replaced by what seems to be a fair equivalent.

  [24] Note.--A French proverb.


                              _SCENE IV._

                          _The same_, GUICHE.

                         GUICHE (_to Carbon_).

Ha! Good morning!

     (_Aside, after looking at Carbon, with satisfaction_). His face is
     green!

                           CARBON (_aside_).

There is nothing left of him but his eyes.

                   GUICHE (_looking at the Cadets_).

So, here are these soreheads!.... Yes, gentlemen, I understand that I am
jeered at plentifully here; that cadets, nobility and gentry, barons
all, are not over-burdened with respect for their Colonel; that they
charge me with intrigue and court-flattery, that my lace collar over my
breastplate is an eye-sore to them,--and that it is distressing to them
to find that one can be a Gascon and still not out at the elbow!

     (_Silence. The Cadets continue to play and smoke._)

Shall I have you punished by your Captain? No.

                                CARBON.

Well, I am free and I punish only....

                                GUICHE.

Ah!....

                                CARBON.

I paid for my company, and it belongs to me. I obey only to war
commands.

                                GUICHE.

Ah!.... Well, that is sufficient.

                      (_speaking to the Cadets_).

                              I can afford to scorn your bluster.
  Everybody knows how I behave under fire. Even yesterday, there were
  enough witnesses to the spirit with which I routed Count de Bucquoi;
  leading my people against his men like an avalanche, I charged him
  three successive times!

           CYRANO (_without lifting his eyes from his book_).

How about your white scarf?

                  GUICHE (_surprised and satisfied_).

You know of this trifle?.... True, it happened, while I was circling to
gather my people for the third charge, that a party of runaways forced
me too close to the enemy; I was in danger of being taken or shot, when,
happily, I bethought me to untie and to drop the scarf that told my
rank. In this way, and without attracting notice, I managed to get away
from the Spaniards, and to turn back upon them with all my men, beating
them terribly!--Now, what do you say to this?

     (_The Cadets affect not to listen, but they have stopped playing,
     and they hold back the smoke of their pipes. A wait._)

                                CYRANO.

I say that Henry IV, even surrounded by a host of foes, never would have
consented to diminish himself by casting off his plume of snowy white.

     (_Silent joy. Playing and smoking are resumed._)

                                GUICHE.

The device was successful, however!

     (_Playing and smoking again suspended._)

                                CYRANO.

Possibly! But who would abdicate the honour of being a target?

     (_Playing and smoking resumed. Growing satisfaction._)

Had I been present when the scarf slipped off,--see how ideas of bravery
can vary, Sir,--I should have picked it up and put it on.

                                GUICHE.

Yes, Gascon boasting again!

                                CYRANO.

Boasting?.... Lend it to me. I offer to hang it on my shoulder and, this
very night, to scale with it the enemy's fortifications.

                                GUICHE.

A Gascon's offer! You know full well that the scarf remained on the
enemy's ground, near the river Scarpe, a place so well covered by
Spanish guns that nobody can venture there to get it!

             CYRANO (_taking a white scarf from his pocket
                and handing it to Guiche_).

Here it is!

     (_Silence. The Cadets restrain their laughter and affect to be very
     busy playing. Guiche turns and looks at them; they assume an air of
     great gravity; one of them, in an absent-minded way, half whistles
     one of the airs the fife played a while before._)

                      GUICHE (_taking the scarf_).

Thank you! I can use this white fabric to make a signal,--that I
hesitated to give.

     (_He goes to the embankment and waves the scarf several times._)

                                  ALL.

What is this?

                  THE SENTINEL (_on the embankment_).

A man, over there, who is running away!....

              GUICHE (_coming down from the embankment_).

One who plays the part of a Spanish spy. He is very useful to us; takes
over to the enemy information that I give him, so that we can influence
their decision.

                                CYRANO.

He is a blackguard!

                 GUICHE (_slowly tying on his scarf_).

Yes, but a great convenience. What were we saying?.... Ah!.... I was
going to apprise you of something. Last night, in a desperate attempt to
revictual us, the Marshal left for Dourlens; he took with him so many
men that an attack upon us just now would certainly be successful. Half
of the army is away from the camp!

                                CARBON.

But the Spanish do not know of it.

                                GUICHE.

Yes, they do. They are going to attack us. My false spy came to tell me
of it. He added: "I can have the attack made wherever you prefer." I
answered: "Good. Leave the camp and watch it. The point to attack will
be the one from which I make a signal to you."

                       CARBON (_to the Cadets_).

Gentlemen, make ready!

     (_The Cadets rise and busy themselves preparing for the fight._)

                                GUICHE.

The attack will take place in an hour from now.

                             A FEW CADETS.

Oh!.... that is different!

     (_They sit down and resume playing._)

                         GUICHE (_to Carbon_).

You must gain time, pending the Marshal's return.

                                CARBON.

And, in order to gain time, what shall we do?

                                GUICHE.

You will have the goodness to get killed, all of you, in defense of the
camp.

                                CYRANO.

Ah! this is his vengeance!

                                GUICHE.

I will not pretend that, if I loved you, I should have selected you;
but, as your bravery has no equal, by using you I am serving my king as
well as my ill-will.

                                CYRANO.

Allow me, Sir, to be thankful for the honour.

                                GUICHE.

Oh! I know that you love to fight one against a hundred. You certainly
cannot complain, then, that I leave you inactive.

     (_He goes toward the rear with Carbon._)

                       CYRANO (_to the Cadets_).

Well, then we will add to the Gascon coat of arms, proud of its six
chevrons of azure and gold, gentlemen, another chevron, still lacking,
one of blood!

     (_Guiche speaks, aside, with Carbon in the rear. Orders are given.
     Preparations against attack. Cyrano goes up to Christian, who has
     remained motionless with folded arms._)

          CYRANO (_placing his hand on Christian's shoulder_).

Christian!

                    CHRISTIAN (_shaking his head_).

Roxane.

                                CYRANO.

Alas!

                               CHRISTIAN.

At least, I should like to condense all the loving farewells of my heart
into a beautiful letter!....

                                CYRANO.

I thought it might be for to-day, and....

                 (_He draws a letter from his doublet_)

                                      .... I have written your farewell.

                               CHRISTIAN.

Let me see!....

                                CYRANO.

You desire to?....

                    CHRISTIAN (_taking the letter_).

Yes, certainly!

     (_He opens the letter, reads, and stops._)

What is this?....

                                CYRANO.

What?

                               CHRISTIAN.

This little round spot?....

           CYRANO (_taking the letter and looking at it with
              an air of innocence_).

A little round spot?....

                               CHRISTIAN.

Yes, a tear!

                                CYRANO.

Oh!.... Yes!.... we poets are caught in our own trap, through the swing
of our art. You understand.... this letter,--was heart-rending; I drew
tears from my own eyes as I was writing it.

                               CHRISTIAN.

Tears?....

                                CYRANO.

Yes.... because.... to die is not so terrible .... but ....never to see
her again, that is the torture! for the fact is, I shall never....

     (_Christian looks at him._)

               We shall never....

                             (_Quickly_).

                             You shall never....

              CHRISTIAN (_snatching the letter from him_).

Give me the letter!

     (_A murmur is heard in the rear._)

                              A SENTINEL.

Ventrebieu! who goes there?

     (_A few musket shots. Voices. Sound of carriage bells._)

                                CARBON.

What is it?

                    SENTINEL (_on the embankment_).

A coach!

     (_All rush up to look._)

                                 CRIES.

What! In the camp?--Coming in!--It seems to come from the
enemy!--Diantre! Fire!--No! the coachman shouted!--Shouted
what?--Shouted: "Service of the King."

     (_They are all on the embankment, looking into the distance. The
     sound of carriage bells grows nearer and nearer._)

                                GUICHE.

What? of the King!....

     (_All come down again and form in line._)

                                CARBON.

Hats off, all!

                  GUICHE (_to those in the distance_).

Of the King! I said.--Make way, you rabble, so that he can swing around
in state.

     (_The coach enters on a full trot. It is covered with mud and dust.
     The curtains are closed. Two lackeys behind. It stops short._)

                          CARBON (_shouting_).

Salute!

     (_Drums beat._)

                                GUICHE.

Lower the step!

(_Two men advance rapidly. The coach door opens._)

                    ROXANE (_jumping out of coach_).

How are you all?

     (_On hearing a woman's voice, they all, from a profound
     inclination, suddenly straighten up. Stupor._)


                               _SCENE V._

                          _The same_, ROXANE.

                                GUICHE.

Service of the King! You?

                                ROXANE.

Certainly, of the only king there is: Love!

                                CYRANO.

Great God.

                    CHRISTIAN (_rushing up to her_).

You, Roxane! Wherefor?

                                ROXANE.

Oh! this siege was entirely too long.

                               CHRISTIAN.

But the reason?....

                                ROXANE.

I'll tell you later.

              CYRANO (_he has remained motionless, without
                  daring to look at her_).

Heavens! Shall I face her?

                                GUICHE.

You cannot remain here!

                           ROXANE (_gayly_).

Oh! yes, I can! Will you be kind enough to bring up a drum?

     (_One of the Cadets brings up a drum, on which she sits._)

There! thank you.

     (_laughing_).

Do you know that they fired on my coach? It looks like a squash, does it
not? As in the fairy tale; and the lackeys like rats.

     (_sending a kiss to Christian_).

How are you, dear?

     (_looking around at them all_).

You don't seem to be very merry here! I didn't know that Arras was so
far off.

     (_looking at Cyrano_).

Cousin, delighted!

                         CYRANO (_advancing_).

Roxane, tell me how?....

                                ROXANE.

How I managed to find the army? Oh! my dear friend, it was the simplest
thing in the world: I drove on so long as I saw the country laid waste.
Such horrors must be seen to be believed! If that is the service of your
King, gentlemen, my service is a better one.

                                CYRANO.

Come, this is foolhardiness! How could you pass?

                                ROXANE.

How? Why! Right through the Spanish army.

                              FIRST CADET.

Oh! women. They are knowing ones!

                                GUICHE.

But how could you get through their lines?

                                LE BRET.

It must have been very difficult!

                                ROXANE.

Why! No. I just went along, in my coach, on a trot. Whenever one of the
Dons showed his haughty face, I put on and displayed through the window
my most fascinating smile, and these gentlemen being, whatever the
French may say, the most courteous people in the world, I passed!

                                CARBON.

Yes, you have a most excellent passport in that smile! But you must
frequently have been called upon, Madam, to declare whither you were
going.

                                ROXANE.

Oh! yes, quite frequently. I answered simply: "I am going to see my
lover."--Immediately the most ferocious Spaniard would gravely close the
door of my coach, with a knightly wave of the hand order up the muskets
already pointed at me, and, with as much grace as haughtiness, the plume
of his hat proudly floating on the breeze, bow low and say: "Pass on,
Senorita!"

                               CHRISTIAN.

But, Roxane....

                                ROXANE.

I said: My lover. Yes, husband, you must forgive! You will surely
understand that, if I had said my husband, nobody would have let me
pass!

                               CHRISTIAN.

But....

                                ROXANE.

Well, what?

                                GUICHE.

You must be gone immediately!

                                ROXANE.

I?

                                CYRANO.

Yes, and sooner!

                               CHRISTIAN.

Yes, at once.

                                ROXANE.

But how can I get away?

                       CHRISTIAN (_embarrassed_).

The fact is....

                    CYRANO (_likewise embarrassed_).

In forty-five minutes....

                      GUICHE (_also embarrassed_).

Or fifty....

                      CARBON (_embarrassed too_).

It would be preferable....

                                LE BRET.

You might....

                                ROXANE.

I remain, for there is going to be fighting.

                                  ALL.

Fighting? Nothing of the kind.

        ROXANE (_throwing herself into the arms of Christian_).

He is my husband! And if he is killed, I must be killed too!

                               CHRISTIAN.

But what is the matter with your eyes?

                                ROXANE.

I will tell you later!

                                GUICHE.

But the post is a most dangerous one.

                          ROXANE (_turning_).

What! So dangerous?

                                CYRANO.

Yes, and the proof is that he assigned it to us.

                         ROXANE (_to Guiche_).

So, you desire to make a widow of me?

                                GUICHE.

I swear to you....

                                ROXANE.

No! Now I am determined and I will not leave!.... Moreover, it is very
exciting.

                                CYRANO.

What! will the "précieuse" turn out to be a heroine?

                                ROXANE.

Monsieur de Bergerac, I am your cousin.

                                A CADET.

Moreover, we will defend you desperately!

               ROXANE (_growing more and more excited_).

I believe it, my friends!

                       ANOTHER CADET (_elated_).

A perfume of iris pervades the camp.

                                ROXANE.

Just so! I put some on this hat, which will be very becoming in the
fray!....

     (_looking at Guiche_).

But perhaps it is time the Count should leave: the fight might begin.

                                GUICHE.

Ah! this is too much! I will inspect the guns and return .... You have a
little time left still,....change your mind!

                                ROXANE.

Never!

     (_Exit Guiche._)


                              _SCENE VI._

                       _The same, except_ GUICHE.

                      CHRISTIAN (_supplicating_).

Roxane!....

                                ROXANE.

No!

                     FIRST CADET (_to the others_).

She remains!

           ALL (_rushing around hurriedly, and brushing up_).

A comb!--Soap!--My doublet is torn: a needle!--A bright bow!--Your
looking glass!--My cuffs!--Your curling iron!--A razor!

       ROXANE (_to Cyrano, who continues begging her to leave_).

No! I will not budge from here!

           CARBON (_after having, like the others, tightened
              his belt and arranged his cuffs, advances
              toward Roxane and says ceremoniously:_)

Such being the case, it may not seem improper for me to present to you a
few of the gentlemen who will have the honour of dying before your eyes.

     (_Roxane bows, and waits leaning on the arm of Christian. Carbon
     makes the presentations._)

Baron de Peyrescous de Colignac!

                          A CADET (_bowing_).

Madam....

                         CARBON (_continuing_).

Baron de Casterac de Cahuzac!--Baron de Malgouyre Estressac Lesbas
d'Escarabiot!--Chevalier d'Antignac-Juzet!--Baron Hillot de
Blagnac--Salechan de Castel Crabioules!

                                ROXANE.

But how many names has each of you.

                             BARON HILLOT.

More than many.

                         CARBON (_to Roxane_).

Kindly open the hand that holds your handkerchief.

           ROXANE (_opens her hand; her handkerchief falls_).

What for?

     (_The whole company darts forward to pick it up._)

              CARBON (_heading them off and seizing it_).

My company had no flag! Now it will have the finest in the camp!

                          ROXANE (_smiling_).

It is rather small!

            CARBON (_tying the handkerchief to his lance_).

It is lace.... and yours!

                       A CADET (_to the others_).

I would die most willingly for eyes so beautiful, if only I could have a
crust of bread or two.

                         CARBON (_indignant_).

For shame! How can you think of eating before so exquisite a woman?....

                                ROXANE.

But he is right. The morning air is sharp, and I myself am famished.
Meat-pie,--cold game and jelly, some good wine,--I'll have nothing else,
thank you! Suppose we have them now? There is still time.

                                A CADET.

But where shall we get all these good things?

                          ROXANE (_quietly_).

In my coach.

                                  ALL.

What!....

                                ROXANE.

But somebody must serve and carve. Look at my coachman more attentively,
gentlemen, and you will see that he is a very valuable man.

                THE CADETS (_running up to the coach_).

Why! It's Ragueneau!

                      ROXANE (_looking at them_).

Poor hungry fellows!

                      CYRANO (_kissing her hand_).

What a kind fairy you are!

                  RAGUENEAU (_standing on his seat_).

Gentlemen!....

                              THE CADETS.

Speech! Speech!

                               RAGUENEAU.

The Spaniards, when so much beauty passed, did not see the repast.
(_Applause._) They are so bony that they did not notice the boned
turkey.

     (_He takes a dish from under his seat and passes it down._)

                     CYRANO (_aside to Christian_).

A word with you for pity's sake!....

                               RAGUENEAU.

They were so busy with Venus that they allowed Diana's spoils to pass.

     (_He hands down a stag's leg._)

                     CYRANO (_aside to Christian_).

I must speak to you!

       ROXANE (_to the Cadets who come up loaded with eatables_).

Place all that on the ground.

     (_She spreads a table-cloth on the grass, and, with the assistance
     of the two lackeys, prepares the cover._)

     (_to Christian, whom Cyrano is endeavouring to draw aside_).

Come, make yourself useful.

     (_Christian helps her. Cyrano looks anxious._)

                               RAGUENEAU.

A stuffed peacock!

         A CADET (_cutting for himself a large slice of ham_).

Jupiter's thunder! We'll not die without previously ....stuffing
our....(_noticing Roxane_) your pardon.... feasting!

          RAGUENEAU (_tossing to them the coach's cushions_).

These cushions are stuffed with ortolans!

     (_Confusion. Cushions ripped open. Laughter. Joy._)

                              THIRD CADET.

Ah! Viédaze!

             RAGUENEAU (_handing out bottles of red wine_).

  Liquid rubies!....

                       (_Bottles of white wine._)

                                                       Melted topaz!....

             ROXANE (_throwing a table-cloth that falls on
                Cyrano's head_).

Attend to this!.... Be nimble!

            RAGUENEAU (_handing down one of the lanterns_).

Each one of the lanterns is a diminutive larder!

           CYRANO (_unfolds the table-cloth, getting near to
              Christian, who assists him_).

I must speak to you before you speak to her!

                     RAGUENEAU (_growing lyrical_).

The handle of my whip is a sausage from Arles!

           ROXANE (_passing the dishes and filling glasses_).

Since we are ordered to die, what care we for the rest of the
army?--Yes! all for the Gascons!--and, if Guiche comes, we'll not invite
him! (_going from one to the other_).

Come, you have plenty of time. Do not eat so fast! Drink a little.--Why
have you tears in your eyes?

                              FIRST CADET.

Because it's all too good!....

                                ROXANE.

Hush!--Red or white?--Bread, Monsieur de Carbon!--A knife?--Your
plate!--Meat pie?--Champagne wine?--Chicken?

           CYRANO (_following her, loaded with eatables, and
              helping her to serve. Aside_).

How I love her!

                   ROXANE (_going up to Christian_).

And what will _you_ have?

                               CHRISTIAN.

Nothing.

                                ROXANE.

Yes, just a cake and a little Muscatel!

               CHRISTIAN (_endeavouring to detain her_).

Oh! tell me why, why you came?

                                ROXANE.

Hush! Let me first give these poor starving fellows something to eat....
I'll tell you by and by....

            LE BRET (_who had gone to the rear, to pass, on
                the end of a lance, a loaf of bread to the
                sentinel on the embankment_).

Here is Guiche!

                                CYRANO.

Make haste, hide bottles, dishes, plates, baskets, everything! Be lively
there! Let him notice nothing!....

     (_to Ragueneau_).

You, get up to your box again!--Be quick! Everything out of the way!

     (_It has taken only a few seconds to conceal everything, under
     tent, doublet, cloak or hat.--Enter Guiche. He stops and sniffs the
     air.--Silence._)


                              _SCENE VII._

                          _The same_, GUICHE.

                                GUICHE.

It smells good here!

               A CADET (_humming an air, unconcernedly_).

To lo lo!....

                GUICHE (_stopping and looking at him_).

Why! what is the matter?.... You are as red as a beet!

                               THE CADET.

I?.... Oh! nothing. Merely my blood. We are going to fight. It boils!

                             ANOTHER CADET.

Poum.... poum.... poum.... patapoum....

                       GUICHE (_turning to him_).

What is this, now?

          THE CADET (_slightly feeling the effects of wine_).

That, oh! nothing. Just a little song!

                                GUICHE.

You are of a lively disposition, my boy!

                               THE CADET.

Oh! the approach of danger!

              GUICHE (_calling Carbon to give an order_).

Captain,....

     (_looking at him with astonishment_).

Zounds! You, too, have an over-healthy look!

              CARBON (_very red in the face, and hiding a
                  bottle behind his back_).

Oh! constitution....

                                GUICHE.

I had a field-piece left and I ordered it placed in that corner
(_pointing to the wings_).

Your men may have occasion to use it.

       ONE OF THE CADETS (_with an affectation of thankfulness_).

Delightful attention!

                 ANOTHER CADET (_smiling gracefully_).

Exquisitely thoughtful!

                           GUICHE (_aside_).

Why! they have all gone mad!--

                              (_sternly_).

                              As you are not accustomed
  to using cannon, beware of the recoil.

                              FIRST CADET.

Who cares for recoil?

                  GUICHE (_going up to him, in rage_).

Look here, Sir!....

                               THE CADET.

Gascon guns never move backward.

           GUICHE (_taking him by the arm and shaking him_).

You are intoxicated, Sir!.... with what?

                         THE CADET (_proudly_).

With the smell of gun powder!

             GUICHE (_shrugs his shoulders, pushes him, and
                goes up to Roxane_).

You must decide quickly. What will you be pleased to do?

                                ROXANE.

I remain!

                                GUICHE.

No, better escape!

                                ROXANE.

Fly? Never.

                                GUICHE.

Such being the case, give me a musket!

                                CARBON.

What for?

                                GUICHE.

I, too, will remain.

                                CYRANO.

At last, Sir, you show your courage!

                              FIRST CADET.

So you are a true Gascon, after all, in spite of your lace?

                                GUICHE.

I never abandon a woman in danger!

                  SECOND CADET (_to the first Cadet_).

Say! don't you think he deserves something to eat?

     (_Eatables and drinkables instantly reappear._)

                    GUICHE (_whose eyes brighten_).

Provisions!

                              THIRD CADET.

Every doublet covers some!

                 GUICHE (_mastering himself, proudly_).

I eat nobody's leavings!

                           CYRANO (_bowing_).

You are improving, Sir!

             GUICHE (_proudly and forgetting to master his
                natural Gascon accent_).

I know how to fight on an empty stomach! _A jeung!_

                       FIRST CADET (_overjoyed_).

He said it with the Gascon accent!

                          GUICHE (_laughing_).

Did I?

                               THE CADET.

He is one of us!

     (_They all begin to dance._)

               CARBON (_who has been away a moment behind
                  the embankment, reappearing on top of it_).

My men are placed, and determined!

     (_He points to a row of lances that show over the crest of the
     embankment._)

                     GUICHE (_to Roxane, bowing_).

Will you accept my hand to pass them in review?....

     (_She gives her hand and they go up to the embankment. Hats come
     off, and everybody follows._)

                   CHRISTIAN (_going up to Cyrano_).

Now! speak quickly!

     (_As Roxane appears on the crest, the lances disappear in a salute;
     she bows._)

                          THE MEN (_outside_).

Hurrah!

                               CHRISTIAN.

What is your secret?....

                                CYRANO.

In case Roxane...

                               CHRISTIAN.

Well?

                                CYRANO.

Should speak to you of letters....

                               CHRISTIAN.

Yes, yes, I know!....

                                CYRANO.

Do not be silly enough to appear surprised....

                               CHRISTIAN.

Surprised by what?

                                CYRANO.

Oh! I must tell you.... The simplest thing in the world .... and I
happened to think of it only to-day, on seeing her. You have....

                               CHRISTIAN.

I have what?

                                CYRANO.

You have....written to her more often than you think.

                               CHRISTIAN.

How so?

                                CYRANO.

Well! I had undertaken to speak for you, and I interpreted your love.
Sometimes I wrote without saying to you: I'm writing!

                               CHRISTIAN.

Oh! you did?

                                CYRANO.

Yes, the simplest thing in the world, as I said!

                               CHRISTIAN.

But, since we have been hemmed in, how did you manage to....

                                CYRANO.

Oh!.... Before dawn I could pass through the lines....

                    CHRISTIAN (_folding his arms_).

Ah! another very simple matter, I suppose? And how many times a week did
I write?.... Twice?--Three times?--Four times?--

                                CYRANO.

More.

                               CHRISTIAN.

Every day?

                                CYRANO.

Yes, every day,--twice.

                      CHRISTIAN (_with violence_).

And this enraptured you, and the rapture was such that each day you
faced death....

             CYRANO (_noticing Roxane, who is returning_).

Hush! not in her presence!

     (_Exit rapidly, under his tent._)


                             _SCENE VIII._

            ROXANE, CHRISTIAN; _in the rear_ CADETS, _going
                    and coming_: CARBON _and_ GUICHE
                            _giving orders_.

                  ROXANE (_running up to Christian_).

And now, dear Christian!....

                  CHRISTIAN (_taking both her hands_).

And now tell me why, over impassable roads, why, through the ranks of
brutal soldiery, you joined me here.

                                ROXANE.

On account of your letters.

                               CHRISTIAN.

My letters?

                                ROXANE.

Yes, and it is your fault if I took so many risks. Your letters
intoxicated me. Ah! remember how many you wrote me, during this last
month, and all so beautiful!

                               CHRISTIAN.

What! Do you mean to say that for a few short love letters?....

                                ROXANE.

  Your letters, yes! My ardent love for you,
  Love passionate, was born that night of bliss
  When, from beneath my willing balcony,
  In accents that to both of us were new,
  A soul revealed itself to me....'twas yours....
  So that, each time your letters came, it seemed
  As if I lived those minutes once again,
  And, rapture-bound, I heard your voice itself,
  Those tender tones that twined around me then.
  So here am I! Penelope would not
  Have persevered in waiting labour if
  Ulysses could have written grandly so;
  But, daft as Helen, she, to join him, would
  Have flung away her tedious worsted balls.

                               CHRISTIAN.

  But....

                                ROXANE.

            Yes, I read and read, while every thrill
  Confirmed me yours. Each leaflet that I held
  Was like a petal wafted from your soul,
  Each word was one of love sincere and strong....

                               CHRISTIAN.

  Indeed, sincere and strong?--You felt it so?....

                                ROXANE.

  Oh! yes, so strongly!

                               CHRISTIAN.

                       And, Roxane, you came....

                                ROXANE.

  I came because.... O Christian, dearest conqueror,
  You'd bid me rise, if I should clasp your knees;
  So 'tis my soul that's at your feet. My soul
  You never can remove from reverence.
  I came to seek forgiveness (and the time
  Is meet, indeed, since death is near, perhaps!),
  Your pardon for--how frivolous I was!--
  Once loving you for beauty's sake alone.

                       CHRISTIAN (_frightened_).

  Roxane!

                                ROXANE.

            But later, dear, with growing sense,
  --A bird will hop before it learns to soar--
  I marked your soul outshining e'en your looks,
  And then I loved you more for both.

                               CHRISTIAN.

                                          And now?

                                ROXANE.

  You have, in short, yourself outshone yourself,
  And now I love you for your soul alone.

                               CHRISTIAN.

  Roxane!

                                ROXANE.

            Rejoice! What is a love we owe
  To passing gifts, to beauty doomed to fade?
  It's torture for an eager, noble heart.
  My thoughts of you recall no handsome face;
  Your beauty that, at first, had captured me,
  Now that my eyes are opened, strikes me not.

                               CHRISTIAN.

  Oh!

                                ROXANE.

       Doubt you not what victory is yours!

                               CHRISTIAN.

  Roxane!

                                ROXANE.

            I understand. Such love as this
  Is past belief.

                               CHRISTIAN.

                  'Tis not the love I seek.
  I wish to be belovèd simply for....

                                ROXANE.

  For what some others prized before to-day?
  Oh! let your heart make room for better love!

                               CHRISTIAN.

  Roxane, your former love was better.

                                ROXANE.

                                        Nay!
  'Tis now I love you better, most and well!
  'Tis what is really you that now I love,
  And I should love you still if you should cease....

                               CHRISTIAN.

  Oh! hush, Roxane.

                                ROXANE.

                       Yes, cease to look so grand.

                               CHRISTIAN.

  If I were homely?

                                ROXANE.

                             Even hideous!

                               CHRISTIAN.

  Roxane!....

                                ROXANE.

                The thought should give you joy profound.

                    CHRISTIAN (_in a husky voice_).

Yes....

                                ROXANE.

What troubles you?

                 CHRISTIAN (_gently pushing her off_).

Nothing. I have an order to give! One second, please....

                                ROXANE.

But....

        CHRISTIAN (_pointing to a group of Cadets in the rear_).

My love for you, my selfishness, has deprived these poor fellows of your
sweet company. Go smile to them a little, since they are about to
die.... Go!

                           ROXANE (_moved_).

How good you are, dear Christian!....

     (_She goes up to the Gascons, who respectfully surround her._)


                              _SCENE IX._

           CHRISTIAN, CYRANO: _in the rear_, ROXANE _speaking
                 with_ CARBON _and some of the Cadets_.

      CHRISTIAN (_calling out in the direction of Cyrano's tent_).

Cyrano!

                CYRANO (_coming out armed for battle_).

What is it? You are white as a ghost!

                               CHRISTIAN.

She loves me no more!

                                CYRANO.

How so?

                               CHRISTIAN.

You are the one she loves.

                                CYRANO.

Nonsense!

                               CHRISTIAN.

Now my soul is all she loves.

                                CYRANO.

Fiddlesticks!

                               CHRISTIAN.

I tell you it is so! You therefore are the one she loves,--and you love
her.

                                CYRANO.

I?

                               CHRISTIAN.

I know it!

                                CYRANO.

Well, it is true.

                               CHRISTIAN.

You love her madly.

                                CYRANO.

More than that.

                               CHRISTIAN.

Tell her so!

                                CYRANO.

No!

                               CHRISTIAN.

Why not?

                                CYRANO.

Look at my face!

                               CHRISTIAN.

She said she would love me even if I were homely!

                                CYRANO.

She really told you so?

                               CHRISTIAN.

She did!

                                CYRANO.

I am very glad she said so! But you must not believe anything so wild.
Do not lose your beauty, for then she would hate me too much.

                               CHRISTIAN.

That we shall see. Let her choose! Tell her all.

                                CYRANO.

No, no! Do not put me to such torture!

                               CHRISTIAN.

Would you have me destroy your happiness because of my good looks? That
would be too unjust!

                                CYRANO.

And I should ruin yours because I happen, by mere chance, to have the
gift of expressing.... that which no doubt you feel?

                               CHRISTIAN.

Tell her all, I say!

                                CYRANO.

You persist in tempting me. It is wrong!

                               CHRISTIAN.

I am tired of having a rival in myself!

                                CYRANO.

Oh! Christian!

                               CHRISTIAN.

Our marriage.... without witnesses.... quite secret, in fact, could be
annulled.... should we survive!

                                CYRANO.

How obstinate he is!....

                               CHRISTIAN.

Perhaps,....but I desire to be loved for myself,....or not at all!--But
enough!... I had better go see how things are progressing. I'll return
presently; meanwhile, speak, and let her prefer one of us two!

                                CYRANO.

It shall be you!

                               CHRISTIAN.

Well.... I hope so!

     (_he calls out_) Roxane!

                                CYRANO.

No, do not call her, please!

                         ROXANE (_running in_).

What is it?

                               CHRISTIAN.

Cyrano will tell you... something.... important....

     (_She runs up to Cyrano. Exit Christian._)


                               _SCENE X._

        ROXANE, CYRANO, _later_ LE BRET, CARBON OF HAUGHTY-HALL,
                 THE CADETS, RAGUENEAU, GUICHE, _etc._

                                ROXANE.

Something important?....

                         CYRANO (_bewildered_).

What! he is gone!.... (_to Roxane_)

                                          Oh, nothing!....
  he attaches--Oh! well, you must know him!--a great deal
  of importance to trifles!

                          ROXANE (_eagerly_).

He doubts, perhaps, the truth of what I said?.... I could almost see he
did not believe it!....

                   CYRANO (_taking her by the hand_).

But was what you said really true?

                                ROXANE.

Certainly. I would love him even.... (_she hesitates a second._)

                       CYRANO (_smiling sadly_).

You stop at the word.... in my presence?

                                ROXANE.

But....

                                CYRANO.

It will not hurt my feelings! You meant: Even if he were homely!

                                ROXANE.

Yes.... homely!

     (_Sound of musketry in the rear._)

                          CYRANO (_ardently_).

Abominably so?

                                ROXANE.

Yes!

                                CYRANO.

Disfigured?

                                ROXANE.

Yes, disfigured!

                                CYRANO.

Grotesque?

                                ROXANE.

Nothing can make him look grotesque.... to me!

                                CYRANO.

And then you would love him still?

                                ROXANE.

More, perhaps!

               CYRANO (_losing his self control, aside_).

Good God! It is true, perhaps, and happiness is there! (_to Roxane_).
Well, then.... Roxane.... listen!....

        LE BRET (_entering rapidly and calling in a low voice_).

Cyrano!

                       CYRANO (_turning around_).

What is it?

                                LE BRET.

Hush! (_whispers to him a few words._)

                   CYRANO (_dropping Roxane's hand_).

Great God!....

                                ROXANE.

What has happened?

                         CYRANO (_stupefied_).

It is all over!

     (_Sounds of musketry again._)

                                ROXANE.

What is it? Why all this firing?

     (_She goes up and looks beyond the embankment._)

                                CYRANO.

All over! I never can tell her!

                  ROXANE (_as if going to rush out_).

What is going on?

                      CYRANO (_restraining her_).

Nothing! nothing!

     (_Cadets enter bearing something which they conceal by forming
     around it a group that keeps Roxane at a distance._)

                                ROXANE.

What are these men here for?

                      CYRANO (_leading her away_).

Never mind them!....

                                ROXANE.

But what is it you were going to say before this disturbance?

                                CYRANO.

Going to say?.... Nothing. Oh! nothing, I swear it, Madam! (_Solemnly_)
I swear that the spirit of Christian and his soul were.... (_correcting
himself_) _are_ the greatest....

                                ROXANE.

You said: were!

     (_With a shriek_). Ah!.... (_she rushes back, pushing the men
     aside._)

                                CYRANO.

The end has come!

           ROXANE (_seeing Christian laid out in his cloak_).

Christian!

                         LE BRET (_to Cyrano_).

The first shot fired by the enemy!

     (_Roxane throws herself upon the body of Christian. Musketry again.
     Clash of arms. Shouts. Drums._)

               CARBON OF HAUGHTY-HALL (_sword in hand_).

The attack! to your arms!

     (_Followed by the Cadets he goes to the other side of the
     embankment._)

                         ROXANE (_in despair_).

Christian! Christian!

          THE VOICE OF CARBON (_from behind the embankment_).

Make haste there!

                                ROXANE.

Christian!

                                CARBON.

_Fall into line!_

                                ROXANE.

Christian!

                                CARBON.

_Measure.... match!_

     (_Ragueneau has rushed up bringing some water in a helmet._)

                      CHRISTIAN (_in dying tone_).

Roxane!....

             CYRANO (_quickly and in a low tone, in the ear
                of Christian, while Roxane, frantic, dips
                into the water of the helmet a piece of
                linen which she has torn from her breast_).

I told her all! and it is you she still loves!

     (_Christian closes his eyes._)

                                ROXANE.

What is it, my love?

                                CARBON.

_Ramrods.... high!_

                         ROXANE (_to Cyrano_).

He is not dead?....

                                CARBON.

_Open charge.... with teeth!_

                                ROXANE.

I feel, here against mine, his cheek getting cold!

                          CARBON (_outside_).

_Take aim!_

                                ROXANE.

A letter in his bosom! (_she opens the letter_) for me!

                           CYRANO (_aside_).

My letter!

                                CARBON.

_Fire!_

     (_Musketry. Cries. Noise of battle._)

             CYRANO (_trying to draw away his hand that is
                held by Roxane, who is on her knees_).

But, Roxane, I must join in the fight!

                      ROXANE (_holding him back_).

Stay just a little. He is dead, and you were the only one who really
knew him.

     (_She weeps softly._) Is it not true that he had an exquisite soul,
     a marvellous one?

                    CYRANO (_standing bareheaded_).

Yes, Roxane!

                                ROXANE.

That he was a thrilling poet, an adorable one?

                                CYRANO.

Yes, Roxane!

                                ROXANE.

A sublime spirit?

                                CYRANO.

Yes, Roxane!

                                ROXANE.

That he had a heart large and brave, too deep to be fathomed by the
crowd?

                           CYRANO (_firmly_).

Yes, Roxane!

        ROXANE (_throwing herself upon the body of Christian_).

And he is dead!

                CYRANO (_aside, as he draws his sword_).

And I to-day can but die, since, though she knows it not, it is for me
she is weeping over him!

     (_Sound of trumpets in the distance._)

            GUICHE (_reappearing on the embankment, hatless,
                wounded in the forehead; with a voice of
                thunder_).

It is the signal that was promised! the trumpets! our comrades come with
help and food! Hold fast a few minutes!

                                ROXANE.

On his letter blood .... and tears!

                  A VOICE (_outside the embankment_).

Surrender!

                              THE CADETS.

No!

              RAGUENEAU (_who has climbed upon the coach,
                  and is looking at the battle over the
                  embankment_).

We are lost!

               CYRANO (_to Guiche, pointing to Roxane_).

Carry her off! I will charge!

          ROXANE (_in dying tones, as she kisses the letter_).

His blood! His tears!....

      RAGUENEAU (_jumping off the coach and running toward her_).

She is fainting!

         GUICHE (_on the embankment, fiercely, to the Cadets_).

Steady, for your lives!

                          A VOICE (_outside_).

Lay down your arms!

                              THE CADETS.

Never!

                         CYRANO (_to Guiche_).

You have proved your valour, Sir! You can afford to fly (_pointing to
Roxane_) and save her!

          GUICHE (_runs to Roxane and takes her in his arms_).

So be it! Hold fast a few moments and we shall win the day!

                                CYRANO.

We'll hold to the death!

     (_In a voice of anguish, looking toward Roxane, whom Guiche and
     Ragueneau are carrying away senseless_).

Farewell, Roxane!

     (_Tumult. Cries. Wounded Cadets reappear and fall within the
     embankment. Cyrano, rushing to the fray, is stopped on the crest of
     the embankment by Carbon of Haughty-Hall, covered with blood._)

                                CARBON.

We are wavering! I have received two gun shots.

                  CYRANO (_shouting to the Gascons_).

Steady there! Hold fast, you rascals!

     (_to Carbon, holding him up_).

Have no fear! I have two deaths to avenge: Christian's and that of my
happiness!

     (_Both come down. Cyrano brandishes a lance to which is attached
     the handkerchief of Roxane._)

Float bravely on, you little flag of lace that is hers! (_He plants the
lance into the ground and cries to the Cadets_).

Fall upon them now! Crush them! (_to the fife player_) And you, strike
up!

     (_The fife plays. The wounded rise to their feet. The Cadets form a
     group around Cyrano and the little flag; others climb into and upon
     the coach, making it look like a small fortress._)

              A CADET (_coming up from the outside of the
                  embankment, backward, still fighting_).

They come! they come!

     (_Falls down dead._)

                                CYRANO.

We'll give them a salute!

     (_The embankment is at once occupied by a troop of the enemy, with
     large flags waving._)

Fire!

     (_General discharge._)

                   ORDER (_from the enemy's ranks_).

Fire!

     (_Most of the Cadets fall, either wounded or dead._)

               A SPANISH OFFICER (_taking off his hat_).

Who are these people dying so bravely?

                 CYRANO (_erect and proudly reciting_).

  Fair Gascony's cadets are they,
  With Carbon,--He of Haughty-Hall;
  They fight and lie without dismay,

     (_He rushes on to enemy, followed by a few surviving Cadets._)

  Fair Gascony's cadets....

_Fifteen years later, in 1655. The garden of the Convent of the Ladies
of the Cross, in Paris._

_Beautiful shade trees. To the left, the house. Wide porch on which
several doors open. In the centre of the stage, an enormous
overspreading tree standing alone in a sort of open circle. To the
right, first entrance, backed by high box-wood bushes, a semi-circular
stone bench._

_In the rear an avenue of chestnut trees leading up to fourth entrance,
right, where the door of the Chapel can be seen through the branches.
Beyond the avenue, lawns, other rows of trees, shrubbery and the sky._

_The Chapel has a small side door, from which starts, running down to
the right, first entrance, behind the box-wood bushes, a sort of
colonnade entwined with creepers rich in hues of gold and red._

_It is Autumn. The russet leaves of the trees are in bright contrast
with the green lawns, except the box-wood and yew-trees that form dark
spots here and there. Yellow leaves beneath the trees; fallen leaves
everywhere on the ground, on the porch and on the benches._

_Between the stone bench to the right and the tree in the centre, a
tapestry frame, and in front of it a chair. Baskets full of worsted
skeins and balls. On the frame, a piece of tapestry-work, unfinished._

_As the curtain rises, sisters are going and coming through the garden;
some are seated on the bench, on either side of an elderly sister.
Leaves are falling._


                               _SCENE I._

    MOTHER MARGARET, SISTER MARTHA, SISTER CLAIRE, _other_ SISTERS.

                 SISTER MARTHA (_to Mother Margaret_).

Sister Claire looked at herself twice in the mirror.

                 MOTHER MARGARET (_to Sister Claire_).

That was very wrong!

                             SISTER CLAIRE.

But Sister Martha pulled a plum out of the pie this morning; I saw her
do it.

                 MOTHER MARGARET (_to Sister Martha_).

Very wrong, indeed, Sister Martha!

                             SISTER CLAIRE.

A little bit of a look!

                             SISTER MARTHA.

A little bit of a plum!

                            MOTHER MARGARET.

I'll have to tell Mr. Cyrano.

                     SISTER CLAIRE (_frightened_).

Oh! please, do not, he would tease us!....

                             SISTER MARTHA.

.... Say that we are vain!....

                             SISTER CLAIRE.

.... Or great gluttons!....

                      MOTHER MARGARET (_smiling_).

But full of goodness.

                             SISTER CLAIRE.

Is it not true, Mother, that he has been coming here, every Saturday,
for the last ten years?

                            MOTHER MARGARET.

And more. Ever since his cousin, fourteen years ago, saddened the
whiteness of our caps with the darkness of her widow's veil, as would a
bird of sombre hue alighting 'mid a flight of brighter birds.

                             SISTER MARTHA.

And he alone can relieve with a ray of light the grief that she persists
in feeding.

                           THE OTHER SISTERS.

He is so entertaining!--It is fun when he comes!--He teases us!--He is
so kind!--We love him so!--And we make sweets for him!

                             SISTER MARTHA.

But he is not a very good Catholic!

                             SISTER CLAIRE.

We'll convert him!

                           THE OTHER SISTERS.

Assuredly, we will!

                            MOTHER MARGARET.

I forbid your tormenting him on that score, children. He might come here
less often?

                             SISTER MARTHA.

But.... dear Mother.... God....

                            MOTHER MARGARET.

Have no fear.... God knows him!

                             SISTER MARTHA.

But, every Saturday, as he enters, he says proudly: "Sister, like a bad
Catholic, I ate meat yesterday!"

                            MOTHER MARGARET.

Is that what he says? Well, the last time he came he had eaten nothing
whatever for two days.

                             SISTER MARTHA.

Mother!

                            MOTHER MARGARET.

He is very poor. Mr. Le Bret told me so.

                             SISTER MARTHA.

And no one assists him!

                            MOTHER MARGARET.

He is proud and would not accept assistance.

     (_Roxane is seen in the rear; she is in black, wearing the long
     veil of a widow. Guiche, grown older, but magnificently clad,
     accompanies her. They walk slowly, Mother Margaret rises._)

Come, it is time to get in.--Here is Madam Madeleine, with a visitor.

               SISTER MARTHA (_aside to Sister Claire_).

It is the Marshall--Duke de Grammont.

                             SISTER CLAIRE.

Yes, I think it is.

                             SISTER MARTHA.

He has not come to see her for months!

                             SISTER CLAIRE.

The court--the army--the world--keep him away, I suppose.

     (_Exeunt Sisters. Guiche and Roxane come down in silence, and stop
     near the tapestry frame. A pause._)


                              _SCENE II._

         ROXANE, DUKE DE GRAMMONT (_formerly Count de Guiche_);
                    _later_ LE BRET _and_ RAGUENEAU.

                                 DUKE.

And so you persist in remaining in this seclusion, uselessly lovely,
forever in mourning?

                                ROXANE.

Forever!

                                 DUKE.

Ever true to his memory?

                                ROXANE.

Ever!

                                 DUKE.

You have forgiven me?

                                ROXANE.

Yes! Since I am here.

     (_A pause._)

                                 DUKE.

And he was truly so?....

                                ROXANE.

You never really knew him!

                                 DUKE.

Probably!.... And his last letter lies on your heart always?

                                ROXANE.

Like a blessèd talisman it hangs on this ribbon.

                                 DUKE.

You love him even dead?

                                ROXANE.

  At times it seems as if he'd left me not,
  As if our hearts still beat as one, as if
  His love still coiled around me, strong, alive!

     (_Another pause._)

                                 DUKE.

Does Cyrano ever come to see you?

                                ROXANE.

Yes, often. He is a very dear old friend, and he brings me all the news.
He comes regularly, every Saturday. As the hour strikes, while I am at
work on my tapestry, I know, without even turning around to see, that he
is here, for I can hear his stick on the stone steps. If the weather is
fine, he sits under this tree, where his chair awaits him. He laughs at
what he calls my eternal work, relates to me the events of the week,
and....

     (_Le Bret appears on the porch._)

Why! here is Le Bret!

     (_to Le Bret, who has come down_).

And how is our friend?

                                LE BRET.

Not at all well.

                                 DUKE.

Oh! I'm sorry.

                          ROXANE (_to Duke_).

Le Bret exaggerates!

                                LE BRET.

All as I predicted: desertion and poverty!.... His epistles have made
him new enemies! He denounces mock nobility, mock piety, mock bravery,
plagiarism,--in fact everybody!

                                ROXANE.

But the fear of his wonderful sword holds them all in respect. They'll
never reach him.

                       DUKE (_shaking his head_).

Who knows?

                                LE BRET.

What I fear for him is not an assault; it is solitude, hunger, winter
stealthily entering his poor abode. These are the enemies that may lay
him low.--Each morning he buckles his belt a little tighter. His nose
has now the sallowness of old ivory. His wardrobe is reduced to one suit
of black.

                                 DUKE.

Ah! he at least is not a parvenu. So, do not pity him too much. He has
lived free from obligations and humiliating restraint.

                       LE BRET (_smiling sadly_).

Duke, Duke!....

                                 DUKE.

Yes, I know: I have everything, and he has nothing.... But I should very
much like to shake his hand.

     (_bowing to Roxane_). Farewell.

                                ROXANE.

I'll see you to the gate.

     (_The Duke bows to Le Bret, and goes, with Roxane, towards the
     house._)

                      DUKE (_stopping a moment_).

  I envy him at times. You see, Roxane,
  When we have had too much success in life,
  Although we've done no very wicked act--
  We feel within a thousand sickly stings
  Of self-reproach; their total is too small
  To constitute remorse, but large enough
  To keep us in a dull uneasiness.
  Thus ducal mantles sweep, as we ascend
  The steps of greatness, with their fringe of furs
  A rustling heap of withered sentiments,
  As now your sombre train, upon the porch,
  Draws in its folds a bunch of autumn leaves.

                         ROXANE (_ironically_).

You are in a very sentimental mood.

                               THE DUKE.

Alas! yes.

     (_as he is about to go out, abruptly_).

                                Monsieur Le Bret!

     (_to Roxane_).

By your permission, one word.

     (_to Le Bret in a low tone_).

                                It is true; no one would
  dare to attack your friend. But there are many who hate
  him, and somebody said to me, yesterday, at the Queen's
  reception: "This Cyrano is not unlikely to meet some day
  with an accident." Tell him not to be about too much.
  To be prudent.

                   LE BRET (_throwing up his arms_).

Prudent, he! But he is coming here to-day, and I must warn him, though I
doubt if that will do much good.

              ROXANE (_who has remained on the porch, to a
                  sister coming up to her_).

What is it?

                              THE SISTER.

Ragueneau wishes to see you, Madam.

                                ROXANE.

Let him in.

     (_Exit Sister._) (_to Duke and to Le Bret_).

              He comes to tell his woes.
  He started to be an author, but became in turn a chanter....

                                LE BRET.

A bath-keeper....

                                ROXANE.

An actor....

                                LE BRET.

A beadle....

                                ROXANE.

A barber....

                                LE BRET.

An archlute-teacher....

                                ROXANE.

To-day what can he have become?

                    RAGUENEAU (_entering rapidly_).

Oh! Madam!

            (_noticing Le Bret_). Oh! Sir!

                          ROXANE (_smiling_).

Tell your misfortunes to Le Bret. I shall be back presently.

     (_Exit Roxane, with the Duke, without listening to Ragueneau, who
     comes down toward Le Bret._)


                              _SCENE III._

                          LE BRET, RAGUENEAU.

                               RAGUENEAU.

After all, since you are here, Sir, it is just as well that she should
be kept in ignorance! I was on my way to see your friend, this
afternoon, when, as I was nearing his door, I saw him coming out. As I
was endeavouring to overtake him, and as he was turning the corner, a
window above him opened, and,--was it through accident? perhaps! a
lackey dropped upon him a heavy log of wood.

                                LE BRET.

Cowards!.... Abominable!

                               RAGUENEAU.

Our friend, Sir, our poet, lay there on the ground with a large hole in
his head!

                                LE BRET.

Is he dead?

                               RAGUENEAU.

No! but in what a state! I carried him up to his room... his room! You
should see what it is!

                                LE BRET.

He is in great pain?

                               RAGUENEAU.

No, Sir, he has not recovered his senses.

                                LE BRET.

You found a doctor?

                               RAGUENEAU.

Yes, one who was good enough to come.

                                LE BRET.

Unfortunate Cyrano!--We must break the news gently to Roxane.--And what
said the doctor?

                               RAGUENEAU.

He spoke of fever.... meningitis. Oh! if you saw him.... with his poor
head bandaged!.... Come quickly, Sir, there is nobody with him! It would
be death to him if he left his bed!

                LE BRET (_urging him toward the right_).

This way is shorter; through the Chapel!

             ROXANE (_appearing on the porch, and seeing Le
                Bret and Ragueneau running up the colonnade
                to the Chapel!_)

Monsieur Le Bret!

     (_Exeunt Le Bret and Ragueneau without answering._)

No doubt another of good Ragueneau's troubles.


                              _SCENE IV._

                ROXANE _alone, two_ SISTERS _a moment_.

  How beautiful these last September days!
  My sadness fain would smile. Spring's ardour oft
  Offends our grief, but Autumn chastens it.

     (_She sits down before her work. Two sisters sally from the house
     carrying a large armchair that they place under the tree._)

  Ah! here's the chair in which Cyrano sits.

                                (_Exeunt Sisters._)

The hour strikes.... he's coming.--Where are my skeins!--He's not here
yet? The first time he is late.... My thimble.... Here it is. Some
sister preaching to him, no doubt.

                              (_A pause._)

How thickly fall the leaves!....

     (_She removes some dead leaves from her work._)

Moreover, what could prevent his coming?

                      A SISTER (_from the porch_).

Monsieur de Bergerac.


                               _SCENE V._

           ROXANE, CYRANO, _and, one moment_, SISTER MARTHA.

                   ROXANE (_without turning around_).

Why did I worry so?

     (_She works.--Enter Cyrano, very pale, with his hat well over his
     eyes. Exit sister who announced him. He descends the steps slowly,
     with a visible effort to remain erect, leaning heavily on his
     stick._)

For the first time in fourteen years, you are late!

              CYRANO (_who has gained his chair and seated
                 himself, speaks in a cheerful tone, in
                 contrast with his looks_).

Yes, and, in truth, I boil with rage. I was delayed....

                                ROXANE.

By what, by whom?

                                CYRANO.

By an intruder.

                         ROXANE (_distraught_).

Some bore? But you got rid of him, or her.

                                CYRANO.

Yes. "Excuse me," said I, "but this is Saturday, and I have a weekly
engagement that nothing can prevent me from keeping. Return an hour
hence!"

                          ROXANE (_lightly_).

The person shall wait. I'll keep you here until evening.

                                CYRANO.

I may be compelled to leave you sooner.

     (_He closes his eyes and remains silent a moment. Sister Martha
     appears in the rear going to the Chapel. Roxane sees her, and
     nods._)

                         ROXANE (_to Cyrano_).

How is it you do not tease Sister Martha to-day?

                 CYRANO (_rapidly, opening his eyes_).

Tease? Of course!

     (_with affected severity_).

                       Sister Martha! Come here.

     (_Sister Martha goes up to him._)

Ha! ha! Your eyes are too fine to remain thus forever down!

                       SISTER MARTHA (_smiling_).

But....

     (_She notices his pale looks._)

Oh!

                  CYRANO (_aside, pointing to Roxane_)

Hush! It's nothing.

     (_aloud, in boastful tone_).

                         I ate meat yesterday! Friday!

                             SISTER MARTHA.

Yes, I know.

            (_aside_). That is the reason he looks so pale!

     (_to Cyrano rapidly and in a low tone_). Come to the refectory by
     and by. I want to make you taste some broth..... Will you come?

                                CYRANO.

Yes, yes, yes.

                             SISTER MARTHA.

Oh! you are very reasonable to-day.

                ROXANE (_who notices their whispering_).

Is she trying to convert you?

                             SISTER MARTHA.

Oh! nothing of the kind!

                                CYRANO.

It is a fact! You always have an abundance of saintly sermons, and
to-day, Sister, you are not preaching to me.

     (_with affected fury_).

Swords and muskets! I, too, shall astonish you! See here, I will permit
you....

     (_Affects to be thinking and to have found a good jest._)

Ah! this is something new.... to.... to pray for me, to-night, in the
chapel.

                                ROXANE.

Oh! oh! this is serious.

                          CYRANO (_laughing_).

Sister Martha is dumfounded!

                       SISTER MARTHA (_gently_).

I did not wait for your permission.

     (_Exit Sister Martha._)

     CYRANO (_returning to Roxane, who is leaning over her work_).

I verily believe there never will be an end to this task of yours.

                                ROXANE.

I am getting accustomed to this remark.

     (_Just then a few dead leaves fall on Roxane's work._)

                                CYRANO.

  Oh! withered leaves!

                  ROXANE (_looking at the landscape_).

                       Poor blondes of Venice hue,
  How fast they fall!

                                CYRANO.

                      They fall, but see how well!
  Their race is short, and still they sweetly show
  How beauty e'er recoils from rottenness:
  For, as they drop, they do not in their grace
  Appear to fall, but rather to alight!

                                ROXANE.

Unusually sad thoughts for you!

              CYRANO (_recovering his presence of mind_).

Sad? Not at all, Roxane!

                                ROXANE.

Come, let the dead leaves fall as they will....Better give me the news,
be my weekly gazette.

                                CYRANO.

Agreed!

                                ROXANE.

I'm listening.

           CYRANO (_getting paler and paler, as he struggles
              against pain_).

Saturday, the 19th, having over indulged in grape-jam from Cette, the
King was taken with fever; his indisposition was sentenced, for high
treason, to be twice lanced, and the royal pulse was relieved of
febricity![25] At the Queen's ball, on Sunday, seven hundred and
sixty-three candles of white wax were burned. Our troops have been
victorious, it is said, over those of John the Austrian; four sorcerers
have been hung! the little dog of Madam d'Athis was given....

                                ROXANE.

Monsieur de Bergerac, you may omit the details!

                                CYRANO.

Monday.... nothing. Oh! yes, Lygdamire took a new lover.

                                ROXANE.

Oh!

          CYRANO (_whose suffering is evidently increasing_).

Tuesday, all the Court was at Fontainebleu. Wednesday, the beauty
Montglat said to Count de Fiesque: No! Thursday, Mancini, Queen of
France,--or almost! the 25th, Montglat said to Fiesque: Yes; and
Saturday, 26th....

     (_His eyes close. His head falls upon his shoulder. Silence._)

              ROXANE (_surprised at hearing nothing more,
                  turns around, looks at him, and rises
                  very much frightened_).

Has he fainted?

     (_Runs up to him._) Cyrano!

                 CYRANO (_opening his eyes and speaking
                    somewhat indistinctly_).

What is it?.... Who?.... When?....

     (_He sees Roxane leaning over him, and, quickly securing his hat on
     his head, backs up into his armchair._)

                       No! no! I assure you, it is nothing.
  I am quite myself again.

                                ROXANE.

But allow me....

                                CYRANO.

It is the old wound I received at Arras.... that.... sometimes.... you
know....

                                ROXANE.

Dearest friend!

                                CYRANO.

But, it is nothing serious. Soon over.

     (_makes an effort to smile_).

Quite well again now.

                     ROXANE (_standing near him_).

We each of us have our wound: I, too, have one, ever smarting; I feel it
here, old though it be,

                         (_placing her hand on her breast_)

                                                             right here,
  beneath the time-worn letter on which can still be seen the
  trace of tears and blood!

     (_Dusk begins to come on._)

                                CYRANO.

His letter!.... Did you not say that some day, perhaps, you would allow
me to read it?

                                ROXANE.

What! you wish?.... his letter?....

                                CYRANO.

Yes.... I wish.... to-day....

                                ROXANE.

     (_handing him the sachet she carries suspended to her neck_).

Here it is!

                         CYRANO (_taking it_).

I may open?

                                ROXANE.

You may open and read!....

     (_She returns to her work, folds it up and arranges her worsteds._)

                          CYRANO (_reading_).

  "Roxane, farewell! The time...."

                    ROXANE (_stopping, astonished_).

                                      You read aloud?

                          CYRANO (_reading_).

  "Roxane, farewell! The time of death has come;
  This eve, I think, belovèd, is my last.
  My soul's still rich in unexpressèd love,
  And I must die! My dazzled eyes no more,
  My eyes for which you were...."

                                ROXANE.

                                           Why! how you read
  His lines!....

                         CYRANO (_continuing_).

          ".... for which you were a thrilling feast,
  No more will drink your ev'ry motion, dear.
  There's one that I recall, so truly yours,
  To smooth your hair, and I would cry aloud...."

                                ROXANE.

  How can you know?....

     (_Darkness comes on by degrees._)

                         CYRANO (_continuing_).

                        "....And now I cry, indeed:
  Farewell!...."

                                ROXANE.

                   You read as if....

                         CYRANO (_continuing_).

                                        ".... My dearest dear,
  My treasure...."

                                ROXANE.

                      Oh! that voice!

                         CYRANO (_continuing_).

                                          "My love!...."

                                ROXANE.

                                                    That voice!
  That voice.... I know I heard it once before!

     (_She passes behind him, leans over the chair, without his noticing
     her, and looks over the letter. Darkness increases._)

                         CYRANO (_continuing_).

  "My yearning heart has never left you once.
  And I am he, and Death will leave me he
  Who loved you, dear, beyond all measure, he...."

              ROXANE (_placing her hand on his shoulder_).

But how is it you still can read? Night has come.

     (_He shudders, turns, sees her near by, moves as if greatly
     alarmed, and hangs his head. Long silence. It is quite dark. She
     joins her hands, and speaks slowly:_)

And during fourteen years you have played this part of an old friend who
comes to amuse!

                                CYRANO.

Roxane!

                                ROXANE.

It was you.

                                CYRANO.

No, no, Roxane, you mistake!

                                ROXANE.

I should have felt it each time you said my name!

                                CYRANO.

It was not I!

                                ROXANE.

It was!

                                CYRANO.

I swear to you....

                                ROXANE.

Swear not, for now I understand your generous deceit. The letters were
yours....

                                CYRANO.

No!

                                ROXANE.

The dear and tender words were yours....

                                CYRANO.

No!

                                ROXANE.

That voice in the night was yours!

                                CYRANO.

I swear it was not!

                                ROXANE.

That soul was yours!

                                CYRANO.

I loved you not!

                                ROXANE.

You did!

                                CYRANO.

It was the other!

                                ROXANE.

You loved me!

                                CYRANO.

No!

                                ROXANE.

You did, for each of your denials is lower than the one before!

                                CYRANO.

  No, no, my dearest, no, I loved you not!

                                ROXANE.

  How many things are dead!.... how many born!....
  --Oh! through these years why were you silent thus,
  Since on these lines, not his by word or thought,
  The tears were yours?

                                CYRANO.

                           Because the blood is his!

                                ROXANE.

  Why then allow a silence that's sublime
  To break as now?

                                CYRANO.

                      Roxane, oh! why, indeed?

     (_Le Bret and Ragueneau enter on a run._)

  [25] Note.--Intentional affectation, like that of "his indisposition
       was sentenced, for high treason."


                              _SCENE VI._

                  _The same_, LE BRET _and_ RAGUENEAU.

                                LE BRET.

How imprudent! I was sure of it! He is here!

            CYRANO (_smiling and straightening himself up_).

Of course, I'm here!

                                LE BRET.

It is suicide, Madam, for him to have left his bed!

                                ROXANE.

Great God! But just now, then....this weakness?.... this fainting?

                                CYRANO.

Oh! by the way, I did not finish my weekly chronicle: ....and Saturday,
26th, one hour before dinner, Monsieur de Bergerac was assassinated in
the street.

     (_He takes off his hat, and his head is seen wrapped in bandages._)

                                ROXANE.

What did he say?--Cyrano!--his poor head!.... What have they done to
you?

                                CYRANO.

  "And in my heart a sword's ennobling point!"
  --So said I once!.... What mockery in fate!....
  And now I'm killed ignobly from behind,
  O'erpowered by a lackey with a log.
  I missed my life; my death's a failure too!

                               RAGUENEAU.

Oh! sir....Oh! sir....

                                CYRANO.

Good Ragueneau, grieve not so!....

                      (_Extends his hand to him._)

                                       And what are you
  doing now, my brother poet?

                    RAGUENEAU (_through his tears_).

I am the one who.... who snuffs the candles at Molière's.[26]

                                CYRANO.

Molière!

                               RAGUENEAU.

But I shall leave him to-morrow. For I am indignant!.... Yesterday he
gave _Scapin_, and I saw that he had taken from you a whole scene!

                                LE BRET.

Entire?

                               RAGUENEAU.

Yes, sir; the famous: "What the deuce was he doing?...."

                         LE BRET (_to Cyrano_).

Molière has robbed you!

                                CYRANO.

Hush! hush! he did well!....

     (_to Ragueneau_).

     The scene was very effective, was it not?

                         RAGUENEAU (_sobbing_).

Oh! sir, what a laugh! what a laugh! through the whole audience!

                                CYRANO.

  My life, you see, is all in this: I've been
  The one who prompts--and ever is forgot!

     (_to Roxane_).

  Do you recall the night when Christian spoke
  His love for you--beneath your balcony?
  The words were mine, and mine the fondest thoughts;
  But I remained below, unknown, in darkness, while
  Another went aloft to gather light and love!
  'Tis justice, and my dying breath approves;
  Molière has genius, Christian's beauty won.

     (_The chapel bell sounds. Sisters pass in the rear, going to
     evening service._)

  It's time for prayer; the bell that tolls is right!

                       ROXANE (_rising to call_).

  Come, Sister!

                      CYRANO (_restraining her_).

                Leave me not to call for help!
  On your return, you would not find me here.

     (_The sisters have entered the chapel, and the organ begins to
     play._)

  I yearned for harmony; and now it's come!

                                ROXANE.

  I love you, live!

                                CYRANO.

                    In fairy tales alone
  Can love dispel the curse of homeliness.
  You'd soon discover that I cannot change.

                                ROXANE.

  You've suffered....and through me!

                                CYRANO.

                                      Through you? Not so!
  I never knew a woman's gentleness.
  My mother found me homely. Sister, none;
  And as to lady-loves, they would have laughed
  At me. Through you, at least, I had a friend;
  Through you I've known the spell a gown can bring!

          LE BRET (_showing the moonlight through the trees_).

  Another friend of yours is there!

                    CYRANO (_smiling to the moon_).

                                             I see.

                                ROXANE.

  I loved but one, and here I lose him twice!

                                CYRANO.

  And now, Le Bret, I'll mount, and reach the moon,
  Although I've not completed that machine....

                                LE BRET.

  Oh! speak not thus!

                                CYRANO.

                      Why not? 'Tis there, I say,
  That I'll be sent to seek for paradise.
  How many souls I love are there in bliss!
  Good Socrates and Galileo too!

                         LE BRET (_indignant_).

No! no! this is too stupid, too unjust! Such a poet! A heart so big and
lofty! To die thus!.... To die!....

                                CYRANO.

There is Le Bret growling again!

                    LE BRET (_bursting into tears_).

My dearest friend!....

             CYRANO (_rising, with wildness in his eyes_).

Fair Gascony's Cadets are they.... The elementary mass.... Why!
yes!....--There is the rub....

                                LE BRET.

Alas! delirious!

                                CYRANO.

Copernicus said....

                                ROXANE.

Dreadful! dreadful!

                                CYRANO.

What the deuce was he doing, what the deuce was he doing in that
galley?....

      De Cyrano de Bergerac,
  Who compassed all and still was naught.

  But I must leave! I would not cause a wait.
  Your pardon. See! the moon sends down for me!

     (_A ray of light from the moon is on him. He falls back into his
     chair. The weeping of Roxane wakes him from his dreamy state. He
     looks at her and strokes her veil._)

  I would not have you weep a wit the less
  For Christian, who was all that's good and grand.
  But, when the hand of ice has laid me low,
  I would your weeds might have a double sense
  Of mourning: first for him....and then for me!

                                ROXANE.

  I swear to you....

             CYRANO (_shaking with fever, rises suddenly_).

                        No! never! In a chair!

     (_to those who advance to assist him_).

  No help!.... From anybody!....

     (_leaning back against the tree_).

                              .... But the tree!

     (_Silence._)

  It[27] comes!--I have already marble boots....
  And gloves of lead!....

     (_He straightens up._)

                         What matters?--Since It's here,
  I'll meet it standing and....

     (_draws his sword_)

                            ....with sword in hand!

                                LE BRET.

  Cyrano!

                          ROXANE (_overcome_).

             God!

     (_All fall back aghast._)

                                CYRANO.

           Ha! ha! I think it looks....
  It dares to look--the flat face--at my nose!

     (_Brandishes his sword._)

  What say you?....That it's useless?....Don't I know?
  But valiant hearts contend not for success!
  It's nobler to defend a hopeless cause!
  --Who are you all? I count a thousand....more!
  I know you now: my enemies of old!
  You're Falsehood!--

     (_Strikes the open air with his sword._)

                    Here!--Ha! ha! and Compromise,
  And Prejudice, and Cowardice!....

     (_He strikes._)

                                   Submit?
  No, never! Ah! here's Imbecility!....
  I know that, in the end, I must succumb,
  I dare you, though, and strike! and strike! and strike!

     (_Strikes right and left with his sword, and stops exhausted._)

  You take my all, the laurel and the rose!....
  Well, take them!.... But, in spite of you, there is
  A something that I bear along with me
  To sweep to-night with grandeur, as I pass,
  The threshold and the gates of heaven's blue;
  A something that's unsullied and is mine....
  Do what you will!

     (_Rushes forward, sword aloft._)

                          It is....

     (_Sword drops out of his hand. He staggers and falls into the arms
     of Le Bret and Ragueneau._)

         ROXANE (_leaning over him and kissing his forehead_).

                                 It is?....

         CYRANO (_opens his eyes, recognises her and smiles_).

                                          ....My plume![28]

  [26] Note.--An evident anachronism, since Molière did not open his
       Paris theatre until three years later (1658). Given, however, the
       deep knowledge of seventeenth century matters displayed
       throughout this drama, the anachronism must be intentional, the
       poet's object doubtless having been to embody the tradition
       according to which the "Qu'allait-il faire dans cette galère?" of
       Molière's "Fourberies de Scapin" (produced only in 1671) was
       taken from Cyrano de Bergerac's "Le Pédant Joué."

  [27] Note.--"It" here is Death (feminine in French). The personifying
       _he_ somewhat customary in English poetry, was set aside, and the
       _neuter_ gender was intentionally preserved, because, being more
       vague, it better represents the terror-striking _unknown_, and is
       more expressive of Cyrano's daring _contempt_ and repulsion for a
       loathsome _thing_. Cyrano, who put to flight one hundred men,
       could not be expected to fear a person, much less a
       personification.

  [28] Note.--See Introduction, Preface and Prefatory Triolets ("Le
       Panache").

ACT I

SCENE:  The stage is divided by an old wall, covered with vines
and flowers.  At the right, a corner of BERGAMIN's private park;
at the left, a corner of PASQUINOT's.  On each side of the wall,
and against it, is a rustic bench.
As the curtain rises, PERCINET is seated on the top of the wall.
On his knee is a book, out of which he is reading to SYLVETTE,
who stands attentively listening on the bench which is on the other
side of the wall.

SYLVETTE.  Monsieur Percinet, how divinely beautiful!

PERCINET.  Is it not?  Listen to what Romeo answers:  [Reading]
  "It was the lark, the herald of the morn,
  No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks
  Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east.
  Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day
  Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops:
  I must be gone"--

SYLVETTE.  [Interrupts him, as she listens.]  Sh!

PERCINET.  [Listens a moment, then]  No one!  And, Mademoiselle,
you must not take fright like a startled bird.  Hear the immortal
lovers:

  "_Juliet._  Yon light is not the daylight, I know it, I,
  It is some meteor that the sun exhales,
  To be to thee this night a torch-bearer,
  And light thee on thy way to Mantua:
  Therefore stay yet, thou need'st not to be gone.

  _Romeo._  Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death;
  I am content, so thou will have it so.
  I'll say, yon gray is not the morning's eye,
  'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;
  Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat
  The vaulty heaven so high above our heads:
  I have more care to stay than will to go:
  Come, death and welcome"--

SYLVETTE.  No, he must not say such things, or I shall cry.

PERCINET.  Then let us stop and read no further until to-morrow.
We shall let Romeo live!  [He closes the book and looks about him.]
This charming spot seems expressly made, it seems to me, to
cradle the words of the Divine Will!

SYLVETTE.  The verses are divine, and the soft air here is a divine
accompaniment.  And see, these green shades!  But, Monsieur
Percinet, what makes them divine to me is the way you read!

PERCINET.  Flatterer!

SYLVETTE.  [Sighing]  Poor lovers!  Their fate was cruel!
[Another sigh]  I think--

PERCINET.  What?

SYLVETTE.  Nothing!

PERCINET.  Something that made you blush red as a rose.

SYLVETTE.  Nothing, I say.

PERCINET.  Ah, that's too transparent.  I see it all: you are
thinking of our fathers!

SYLVETTE.  Perhaps--

PERCINET.  Of their terrible hatred for each other.

SYLVETTE.  The thought often pains me and makes me cry when I am
alone.  Last month, when I came home from the convent, my father
pointed out your father's park, and said to me:  "My dear child,
you behold there the domain of my mortal enemy, Bergamin.  Never
cross the path of those two rascals, Bergamin and his son Percinet.
Mark well my words, and obey me to the letter, or I shall cast you
off as an enemy.  Their family has always been at bitter enmity
with our own."  And I promised.  But you see how I keep my word!

PERCINET.  Did I not promise my father to do the same, Sylvette?
Yet I love you!

SYLVETTE.  Holy saints!

PERCINET.  I love you, my dearest!

SYLVETTE.  It's sinful!

PERCINET.  Very--but what can we do?  The greater the obstacles
to be overcome, the sweeter the reward.  Sylvette, kiss me!

SYLVETTE.  Never!  [She jumps down from the bench and runs off a
few steps.]

PERCINET.  But you love me?

SYLVETTE.  What?

PERCINET.  My dear child:  I, too, sometimes think of us and
compare you and me with those other lovers--of Verona.

SYLVETTE.  But _I_ didn't compare--!

PERCINET.  You and I are Juliet and Romeo;  I love you to despair,
and I shall brave the wrath of Pasquinot-Capulet and
Bergamin-Montague!

SYLVETTE.  [Coming a little nearer to the wall]  Then we love?
But how, Monsieur Percinet, has it happened so soon?

PERCINET.  Love is born we know not how, because it must be born.
I often saw you pass my window--

SYLVETTE.  I saw you, too!

PERCINET.  And our eyes spoke in silence.

SYLVETTE.  One day I was gathering nuts in the garden by the wall--

PERCINET.  One day I happened to be reading Shakespeare.  See
how everything conspired to unite two hearts!

SYLVETTE.  And a little gust of wind blew my scarf in your direction.

PERCINET.  I climbed to the wall to return it--

SYLVETTE.  [Climbing the wall again]  I climbed too!

PERCINET.  And since that day, my dear, I have waited at the same
hour, here by this wall; and each time my heart beat louder and
faster, until I knew by your soft laugh that you were near!

SYLVETTE.  Now since we love, we must be married.

PERCINET.  I was just thinking about that.

SYLVETTE.  [Solemnly]  I, last of the Pasquinots, do solemnly
pledge myself to you, last of the Bergamins.

PERCINET.  What noble recklessness!

SYLVETTE.  We shall be sung in future ages!

PERCINET.  Two tender children of two hard-hearted fathers!

SYLVETTE.  But who knows whether the hour is not at hand when our
fathers' hatred may end?

PERCINET.  I doubt it.

SYLVETTE.  I have heard of stranger things.  I can think of half a
dozen--

PERCINET.  What, for instance?

SYLVETTE.  Imagine that the reigning prince comes riding past some
day--I run to him and kneel, and tell him the story of our love
and of our fathers' hatred.  The prince asks to see my father and
Bergamin, and they are reconciled.

PERCINET.  And your father gives me your hand!

SYLVETTE.  Yes.  Or else, you languish, the doctor declares you
cannot live--

PERCINET.  And asks:  "What ails you?"

SYLVETTE.  And you answer:  "I must have Sylvette!"

PERCINET.  And his pride is then forced to bend.

SYLVETTE.  Yes.  Or else:  an aged duke, having seen my portrait,
falls in love with me, sends a 'squire to sue for my hand, and offers
to make me a duchess.

PERCINET.  And you say, "No!"

SYLVETTE.  He is offended, and some dark night when I am in the
garden, meditating, he springs forth out of the darkness!  I scream!

PERCINET.  And I lose not a second in springing over the wall,
dagger in hand.  I fight like a tiger, I--

SYLVETTE.  You lay low three or four men.  Then my father rushes
in and takes me in his arms.  You tell him who you are.  His heart
softens, he gives me to my savior.  Your father consents, for he
is proud of your bravery.

PERCINET.  Then we live together for years, happy and content!

SYLVETTE.  This is not at all impossible, is it?

PERCINET.  Someone's coming!

SYLVETTE.  [Forgetting herself]  Kiss me!

PERCINET.  [Kissing her]  This evening, at eight, then?  As
usual?  You will come?

SYLVETTE.  No.

PERCINET.  Yes!

SYLVETTE.  [Disappearing behind the wall]  Your father!  [PERCINET
jumps quickly from the wall.]

[Enter BERGAMIN.]

BERGAMIN.  Ah, ha, I find you here again, dreaming in this corner
of the park!

PERCINET.  Father, I love this old corner!  I adore this bench over
which the vines of the wall have so gracefully draped themselves.
See, what graceful arabesques these festoons make!  The air is
purer here.

BERGAMIN.  By the side of this wall?

PERCINET.  I love it!

BERGAMIN.  I see nothing lovable about it!

SYLVETTE.  [Aside]  He can't see why!

PERCINET.  But it is charming, all covered with ivy and creeper.
See here, what honeysuckle!  This hundred-year-old wall, with its
clinging vines, its constellations of flowers, looking through the
crannies, kissed by the summer sun, makes the bench a throne fit
for kings!

BERGAMIN.  Nonsense, you hare-brained youth!  Do you mean to tell
me that this wall has eyes?

PERCINET.  Ah, what eyes!  [Turns toward the wall.]  Of soft azure,
yet dazzlingly blue; let but a tear come to dim your brightness,
or a single kiss--

BERGAMIN.  But the wall hasn't eyes, you idiot!

PERCINET.  See this vine, though!  [He plucks part of the vine from
the wall and graciously presents it to his father.]

SYLVETTE.  [Aside]  How clever!

BERGAMIN.  How stupid!  But I know now what has turned your silly
head: you come here to read!  [SYLVETTE starts as she hears this.
PERCINET also shows signs of fear as his father pulls the book from
the youth's pocket.]  Plays!  [He drops the book in horror.]  And
verse!  Verse!  That's what has turned your head.  Now I see why you
talk about eyes and honeysuckle.  I tell you, to be useful, a wall
doesn't have to be beautiful.  I am going to have all this green
stuff taken away, and the bricks re-laid and the holes stopped up.
I want a white wall and a high one to keep the neighbors from
looking into our park.  I want no vines and honeysuckles.  Along
the top I'll sprinkle broken glass--

PERCINET.  Pity!

BERGAMIN.  No pity!  I insist on it!  Glass--all along the top of
the wall!  [SYLVETTE and PERCINET are in despair.  BERGAMIN sits
down on the bench.]  And now, I have something to say to you.  [He
rises and examines the wall.]  If the wall hasn't eyes, it may
possibly have ears?  [He is about to stand on the bench, when
PERCINET takes fright and SYLVETTE clings close to her side of the
wall, making herself as small as she can.  BERGAMIN decides not
to scale the wall, but motions to his son to do so.]  See whether
some curious listener--?

PERCINET.  [Climbing to the top and leaning over so that SYLVETTE
can hear him]  Till to-night!

SYLVETTE.  [Giving him her hand, which he kisses]  I'll come as
the clock is striking!  I adore you!

BERGAMIN.  [To PERCINET]  Well?

PERCINET.  [Jumping down--to his father]  No one!

BERGAMIN.  [Re-seating himself]  Well, then, my boy, I should like
to see you married.

SYLVETTE.  [Aside]  Oh!

BERGAMIN.  What's that?

PERCINET.  Nothing.

BERGAMIN.  I thought I heard a cry?

PERCINET.  [Looking into the air]  Some wounded bird, perhaps.

BERGAMIN.  I have given the matter my undivided attention, and have
chosen a wife for you.  [PERCINET whistles and walks away.]  I tell
you, I am in earnest and I intend to force you, if necessary.
[PERCINET continues whistling.]  _Will_ you stop that confounded
whistling!  The young woman is rich--she's a jewel!

PERCINET.  I want none of your jewels!

BERGAMIN.  I'll show you, you young insolent!

PERCINET.  [Grasping his father's cane, which is raised as if to
strike him]  Spring has filled the bushes with the songs of birds;
the brooklets accompany the love-notes of wild birds.

BERGAMIN.  Rascal!

PERCINET.  [Still holding the cane]  The whole world laughs and
sings farewell to April.  The butterflies--

BERGAMIN.  Ruffian!

PERCINET.  [As before]  Wing their way across the meadows, to make
love to the adored flowers!  Love--

BERGAMIN.  Villain!

PERCINET.  Love opens wide the heart of all nature.  And you ask
me to consent to a marriage of reason!

BERGAMIN.  Of course I do!

PERCINET.  [Passionately]  No, no, no, Father.  I swear by this
wall--which hears me, I hope--that my marriage will be more
romantic than any dreamed of in the most poetic of the world's love
stories!  [He runs out.]

BERGAMIN.  [Pursuing him]  Ah, let me catch you--!

SYLVETTE.  I can really understand now why Papa hates that odious
old man!

[Enter PASQUINOT, left.]

PASQUINOT.  Well, Mademoiselle, what are you doing here?

SYLVETTE.  Nothing.  Taking the air.

PASQUINOT.  Alone?  But, you silly girl, are you not afraid?

SYLVETTE.  Not in the least.

PASQUINOT.  Near this wall?  I forbade you to come near it!  You
see that park over there?  That belongs to my mortal enemy!

SYLVETTE.  I know it, Father dear.

PASQUINOT.  Why, here you are exposed to any insult, any--if those
rascals knew that my daughter were walking alone in this park--
Brr!  It makes me shiver to think of!  I'm going to have the wall
repaired, and erect a huge iron grill on top of it.

SYLVETTE.  [Aside]  He'll never do it--it would cost too much!

PASQUINOT.  Now go into the house--quick!  [She goes out, PASQUINOT
glowering at her.]

BERGAMIN.  [Heard from the other side of the wall, as he enters]
Take this note at once to Monsieur Straforel.

PASQUINOT.  [Running to the wall and climbing to the top of it]
Bergamin!

BERGAMIN.  [Doing likewise]  Pasquinot!  [They embrace.]

PASQUINOT.  How are you?

BERGAMIN.  Pretty well.

PASQUINOT.  How's your gout?

BERGAMIN.  Better.  And how is your cold?

PASQUINOT.  Still troubles me, devil take it!

BERGAMIN.  Well, the marriage is arranged!

PASQUINOT.  What?

BERGAMIN.  I heard everything--I was hidden in the bushes.  They
adore each other!

PASQUINOT.  Bravo!

BERGAMIN.  We must bring matters to a head!  [He rubs his hands.]
Ha, ha!  Now we can do as we had planned--

PASQUINOT.  Yes, and tear down the wall.

BERGAMIN.  And live together.

PASQUINOT.  Joining our properties.

BERGAMIN.  By marrying our children.  But I wonder whether they
would be so anxious if they knew we wished it?  A marriage arranged
beforehand is not so tempting to two young children so romantic as
ours.  That is why we kept our own wishes a secret.  I felt sure
that after they had been separated--Sylvette in the convent,
Percinet at school--they would thrive on their secret love.  That
is how I came to invent this hatred of ours.  And you even doubted
its success!  Now all we have to do is to say Yes.

PASQUINOT.  But how can it be done?  Remember, I've called you a
scoundrel, fool, idiot--

BERGAMIN.  Idiot?  Scoundrel was sufficient.

PASQUINOT.  Now what pretext--?

BERGAMIN.  Your daughter herself has given me an inspiration.  This
evening they are to meet here at eight.  Percinet comes first.  At
the moment Sylvette appears, mysterious men in black will emerge
from the shadows and start to carry her off.  An abduction!  She
screams, then our young hero gives chase, draws his sword--the
ravishers pretend to flee--I arrive on the scene, then you--your
daughter is safe and sound.  You bless the couple and drop a few
appropriate tears; my heart is softened.  Tableau.

PASQUINOT.  A stroke of genius.

BERGAMIN.  [Modestly]  Yes--I think it really is.  Look--see that
man coming?  It's Straforel, the bravado whom I wrote to a few
minutes ago.  He is to superintend the abduction.

[STRAFOREL, in an elaborate swordsman's costume, appears at the
back of BERGAMIN's park, and swaggers down-stage.]

BERGAMIN.  [Descending from the wall and bowing low to STRAFOREL]
Allow me to introduce you to my friend Pasquinot.

STRAFOREL.  [Bowing]  Monsieur!  [He raises his head and sees no
PASQUINOT.]

BERGAMIN.  [Pointing to PASQUINOT on the crest of the wall]
There, on the wall!--Now, my dear master, does my plan meet with
your approval?

STRAFOREL.  It does.  It is most simple.

BERGAMIN.  You must act quickly, you understand?

STRAFOREL.  And say nothing!

BERGAMIN.  A make-believe abduction and stage-fight with swords.

STRAFOREL.  I understand perfectly.

BERGAMIN.  You must have skilful swordsmen--I can't have my boy
hurt.  He is my only child!

STRAFOREL.  I will see to that myself.

BERGAMIN.  Good.  In that case, I shall fear nothing.

PASQUINOT.  [Aside to BERGAMIN]  Ask him the price?

BERGAMIN.  For an abduction, Maestro, how much do you charge?

STRAFOREL.  That depends, Monsieur, on the kind you wish; we have
them at all prices.  In an affair of this kind, however, nothing
should be spared.  If I were in your place, I should have a
first-class abduction.

BERGAMIN.  [Surprised]  Then you have many classes?

STRAFOREL.  Indeed I have.  I have the ordinary vulgar abduction
in a cab, with two men dressed in black--that's rarely used;  the
daylight abduction, the midnight abduction;  the pompous abduction
in a court carriage, with powdered servants--wigs are extra--with
mutes, negroes, brigands, musketeers, anything you like!  The
abduction in a post-chaise, with two, three, four, five, horses,
ad lib.;  the discreet and quiet abduction, in a small carriage--
that one's rather lugubrious;  the rollicking abduction, in which
the victim is carried away in a sack;  the romantic abduction in a
boat--but a lake is necessary!--the Venetian abduction, in a
gondola--ah, you have no lagoon!  Moonlight abduction, or the
abduction on a dark and starless night--those moonlight abductions
are quite the style, though they are a little dear!--Besides these,
there is the abduction by torch-light, with cries and screams, and
clash and shock of arms;  the brutal abduction, the polite
abduction;  the classical one with masks;  the gallant abduction to
the accompaniment of music;  but the latest, most stylish, gayest of
all, is the sedan-chair abduction!

BERGAMIN.  [Scratching his head--aside to PASQUINOT]  Well, what
do you think?

PASQUINOT.  Hm, what do you?

BERGAMIN.  I think that we should do everything in the best possible
way, no expense spared.  Let us give our young romancers something
they'll not soon forget.  Let's have it with masks, dark mantles,
torches, music, and a sedan-chair!

STRAFOREL.  [Taking notes]  A first-class, then, with all extras.

BERGAMIN.  That's it.

STRAFOREL.  I shall return soon.  [To PASQUINOT]  Remember,
Monsieur, to leave open the door of your park to-night.

BERGAMIN.  Very well, it shall be done.

STRAFOREL.  [Bowing]  My compliments.  [Turning to go]  One
first-class--with extras.  [He goes out.]

PASQUINOT.  The honest man, he went without telling us the price!

BERGAMIN.  Everything is arranged.  Now we'll live together, after
demolishing the wall.

PASQUINOT.  And in winter we'll have but one hearth and home!

BERGAMIN.  Our dearest wishes are about to be realized!

PASQUINOT.  And we'll grow old together!

BERGAMIN.  Dear old Pasquinot!

PASQUINOT.  Dear old Bergamin!  [They embrace.  SYLVETTE and
PERCINET enter, from each side of the stage and, seeing their
fathers embrace]

SYLVETTE.  Oh!

BERGAMIN.  [Aside to PASQUINOT]  Your daughter!

PERCINET.  Oh!

PASQUINOT.  [Aside to BERGAMIN]  Your son!

BERGAMIN.  [Aside to PASQUINOT]  We must pretend to fight!  [Their
embrace is transformed into a struggle.]  Rascal!

PASQUINOT.  Fool!

SYLVETTE.  [Pulling her father's coat-tails]  Papa!

PERCINET.  [Doing the same with his father]  Papa!

BERGAMIN.  Let us be!

PASQUINOT.  He insulted me!

BERGAMIN.  He struck me!

PASQUINOT.  Coward!

SYLVETTE.  Papa!

BERGAMIN.  Thief!

PERCINET.  Papa!

PASQUINOT.  Bandit!

SYLVETTE.  Papa!!  [SYLVETTE and PERCINET finally succeed in
separating the fathers.]

PERCINET.  [Dragging his father away]  Go in now, it's late.

BERGAMIN.  [Trying to go to the wall again]  I can't control
myself.  Just let me--!  [PERCINET takes him out.]

PASQUINOT.  [Also trying to return to the wall]  I'll kill him!

SYLVETTE.  [Dragging PASQUINOT out]  The air is so damp!  Think
of your rheumatism!  [They go out.]

[Little by little it grows dark.  For a moment the stage is empty.
Then, in PASQUINOT's park, enter STRAFOREL and swordsmen, musicians,
and torch-bearers.]

STRAFOREL.  I see one star already.  The day is dying.  [He places
his men about the stage.]  Stay there--you there--and you there.
The hour is near.  You will see, as the clock strikes eight, a
figure in white enter on this side.  Then I whistle--[He looks at
the sky again.]  The moon?  Splendid!  Every effect is perfect
to-night!  [Examining the costumes of his band]  The capes and
mantles are excellent.  Look a little more dangerous, over there!
Now, ready?  [A sedan-chair is brought in.]  The chair over there
in the shade.  [Seeing the negroes who carry the chair]  The
negroes are good!  [Speaking at a distance]  Torches, there, you
understand you are not to come until you receive the signal?  [The
faint reflection of the torches is seen at the back of the stage,
through the underbrush.  Enter the musicians.]  Musicians?  There--
at the back.  Now, a little distinction and life!  Vary your poses
from time to time.  Stand straight, mandolin!  Sit down, alto!
There.  [Severely to a swordsman]  You, first mask, don't look so
harmless--I want a villainous slouch!  Good!  Now, instruments,
play softly--tune up!  Good--tra la la!  [He puts on his mask.]

[PERCINET enters slowly from the other side of the stage.  As he
speaks the following lines, the stage becomes darker, until at the
end, it is night.]

PERCINET.  My father is calmer now.  The day is dying, and the
intoxicating odor of the elders is wafted to me; the flowers close
their petals in the gray of the evening--

STRAFOREL.  [Aside to the violins]  Music!

[The musicians play softly until the end of the act.]

PERCINET.  I tremble like a reed.  She is coming!

STRAFOREL.  [To the musicians]  Amoroso!

PERCINET.  My first evening meeting--I can scarcely stand!  The
evening breeze sounds like the fluttering of her dress.  Now I
can't see the flowers, but I can smell them.  Ah, this great tree,
with a star above it--Music?  Who--?  [A pause.]  Night has come.
[After another pause, a clock strikes eight in the distance.
SYLVETTE appears at the back of her park.]

SYLVETTE.  The hour has struck.  He must be waiting.

[A whistle is heard.  STRAFOREL rises in front of SYLVETTE, and
torch-bearers appear in the background.  SYLVETTE screams.  The
swordsmen seize and put her into the sedan-chair.]

SYLVETTE.  Help!  Help!

PERCINET.  Great Heavens!

SYLVETTE.  Percinet, they are carrying me off!

PERCINET.  [Leaping to the wall]  I come!  [When he reaches the
top of the wall, he draws his sword, jumps down on the other side,
and engages four or five swordsmen in combat.  They flee before
him.]  There, and there, and there!

STRAFOREL.  [To the musicians]  Tremolo!

[The violins now play a dramatic tremolo.]

STRAFOREL.  Per Bacco, he's the devil, that child!  [PERCINET now
engages STRAFOREL in a duel.  STRAFOREL, after a few thrusts, puts
his hand to his breast.]  I--I'm mortally wounded!  [He falls.]

PERCINET.  [Running to SYLVETTE, who sits in the sedan-chair]
Sylvette!  [He kneels to her.]

SYLVETTE.  My savior!

PASQUINOT.  [Entering]  Bergamin's son!  Your savior?  Your
savior?  I give you to him!

SYLVETTE and PERCINET.  Heavens!

[BERGAMIN now appears on his side of the wall.]

PASQUINOT.  [To BERGAMIN, who is seen on top of the wall]
Bergamin, your son is a hero!  Let us forget our quarrels, and make
these children happy!

BERGAMIN.  [Solemnly]  I hate you no more!

PERCINET.  Sylvette, don't speak loud:  I know I am dreaming.  But
don't wake me!

BERGAMIN.  Our hatred is ended in the marriage of our dear ones.
[Indicating the wall]  Henceforth let there be no Pyrenees!

PERCINET.  Who would have believed that my father could change so!

SYLVETTE.  I told you everything would turn out happily!  [While
the lovers go up-stage with PASQUINOT, STRAFOREL rises and hands
a folded paper to BERGAMIN.]

BERGAMIN.  [Aside]  What is it?  This paper--your signature?  What
is it, if you please?

STRAFOREL.  [Bowing]  Monsieur, it's my bill!  [He falls down
again.]


Curtain


*     *     *     *     *

ACT II

SCENE:  The same, except that the wall has disappeared.  The benches
which were formerly against it are removed to the extreme right
and left.  There are a few extra pots of flowers and two or three
plaster statues.  To the right is a small garden table, with chairs
about it.

As the curtain rises, PASQUINOT is sitting on the bench to the
left, reading a paper.  BLAISE is at the back, busy with his rake.

BLAISE.  So the notary comes to-night, Monsieur Pasquinot?  It is
pleasant, now that the wall is down, and you living together this
past month.  It was high time, I'm thinking.  The little lovers
must be happy!

PASQUINOT.  [Raising his head and looking about]  So you like it
without the wall, Blaise?

BLAISE.  The garden is superb!

PASQUINOT.  Yes, my property has increased a hundred per cent!
[Poking a tuft of grass with his foot]  Have you watered the
grass?  [Furiously]  You have no business doing that during the
day!

BLAISE.  But Monsieur Bergamin told me to!

PASQUINOT.  Ah, I see!  He seems to think that the more grass is
watered the better it becomes.  Well, take those plants out of the
green-house.  [As BLAISE begins arranging plants which he gets from
the green-house--just off-stage--enter BERGAMIN at the back.]

BERGAMIN.  [Watering some flowers from a large watering can]  Dear
me, these plants never get enough water!  [To a tree]  Hey there,
old man, you never get enough to drink, do you?  There's for you!
[Laying down the watering can, he looks about him with
satisfaction.]  Yes, it is better now.  Very pretty--those statues
there are a decided improvement.  [Catching sight of PASQUINOT]
How are you?  [No answer.]  How are you?  How are you?  [PASQUINOT
raises his head.]  Well?

PASQUINOT.  My friend, why ask that?  We see each other all the time!

BERGAMIN.  Oh, very well.  [Seeing BLAISE arranging the plants]
_Will_ you take those plants back?!  [BLAISE, not knowing what to
do, takes them back immediately.  PASQUINOT raises his eyes, shrugs
his shoulders, and then resumes his reading.  BERGAMIN walks back
and forth, and finally sits down near PASQUINOT.  There is a pause.]
I used to come here every day, in silence--

PASQUINOT.  [Laying aside his paper]  I, too--it was most amusing!

BERGAMIN.  And our secret!

PASQUINOT.  The very danger was amusing.

BERGAMIN.  And the things we had to say of each other--!

PASQUINOT.  Very amusing.--Bergamin?

BERGAMIN.  Pasquinot?

PASQUINOT.  Something's lacking now.

BERGAMIN.  The idea!  [After a moment's reflection]  Yes, I agree
with you.  Funny--are you losing your sense of the romantic?  [He
looks at PASQUINOT and says, aside]  His waistcoat often lacks a
button!  It's disgusting!  [He rises and walks back and forth.]

PASQUINOT.  [Looking over his paper--aside]  He looks like some
immense beetle.  [He pretends to be reading as BERGAMIN passes him.]

BERGAMIN.  [Aside]  See the ridiculous way he reads!  [He whistles
as he walks away up-stage.]

PASQUINOT.  [Aside]  Whistling!  Oh, Heavens!  Don't do that,
whistling makes me nervous.

BERGAMIN.  [With a smile]  Remember the mote in your neighbor's
eye.  You, too, get on my nerves sometimes.

PASQUINOT.  I?

BERGAMIN.  You tell the same story twenty times a day.

PASQUINOT.  Why, I--

BERGAMIN.  And when you sit down you swing your foot like a
pendulum.  At meals you roll your bread in a most disgusting manner.

PASQUINOT.  Ha, you take me to task for my irritating mannerisms!
But let me tell you, you are no less unpleasant.  You are ridiculous
and thoroughly selfish.  I know now what the trouble is: the wall--
with it, we were happy, now we don't live at all.

BERGAMIN.  We didn't do this for ourselves, did we?

PASQUINOT.  No, we did not!

BERGAMIN.  It was for our children.

PASQUINOT.  For our children, yes.  Let us therefore suffer in
silence, and regret our former liberty.

BERGAMIN.  Sacrifice is the lot of parents.

[SYLVETTE and PERCINET appear at the left, up stage, arm in arm.]

PASQUINOT.  Sh--the lovers!

BERGAMIN.  [Looking at them]  See them!  How they love each other!
Like the old pilgrims of love, they return each day to the sacred spot.

[The lovers, who have meantime disappeared, re-appear on the
opposite side of the stage, and come down toward the old men.]

PASQUINOT.  If they are talking as they usually do, their
conversation will be well worth listening to!

[BERGAMIN and PASQUINOT retire behind a tree.]

PERCINET.  I love you.

SYLVETTE.  I love you.  [They stop.]  Here is the famous spot.

PERCINET.  Yes.  He fell here, that big fellow, pierced to the heart.

SYLVETTE.  There was I, like Andromeda.

PERCINET.  And I was Perseus!

SYLVETTE.  How many were there against you?

PERCINET.  Ten!

SYLVETTE.  Oh, there were twenty at least, not counting the big
leader.

PERCINET.  Or thirty--there must have been!

SYLVETTE.  Tell me once more how it was accomplished?

PERCINET.  They fell--like cards in a row!

SYLVETTE.  Our story should be put into a poem!

PERCINET.  It shall be.

SYLVETTE.  How I love you!

PERCINET.  I adore you!

SYLVETTE.  A realized dream.  How my heart beats!  I would never
think of marrying a commonplace little husband picked out by my
father!

PERCINET.  Indeed?

SYLVETTE.  No, no, not the way husbands are usually given to young
girls.

PERCINET.  No, _you_ would never have thought of marrying the son
of your father's best friend.

SYLVETTE.  [Laughing]  Indeed not.  Have you noticed how our
fathers have lately--?

PERCINET.  Yes, like two dogs.

BERGAMIN.  [Aside]  Hm!

PERCINET.  And I know the reason why.  This new arrangement is not
the best thing for their property.  Our fathers are very good
people, you know, but they haven't much soul, and our brilliant
adventure rather throws them into the shade--

PASQUINOT.  [Aside]  How's that?

SYLVETTE.  You see, they are fathers of celebrated lovers.  Poor
fathers, how they have been deceived!

PASQUINOT.  [Aside]  Ha, ha!

PERCINET.  Yes, fate has been with us!

BERGAMIN.  [Aside]  Ha, ha!

SYLVETTE.  And to-night the marriage-contract is to be signed!

PERCINET.  I must have musicians.

SYLVETTE.  Then go quick.

PERCINET.  I fly!

SYLVETTE.  [Calling him back]  I'll take you as far as the gate.
[They go up-stage, arm in arm.]  We are at least as great as the
most celebrated lovers.

PERCINET.  We shall take our place with Romeo and Juliet!

SYLVETTE.  Aminta and her shepherd.

PERCINET.  Pyramus and Thisbe.

SYLVETTE.  And so many others!  [They disappear, but their voices
are heard outside.]

Voice of PERCINET.  Francesca and Paolo.

Voice of SYLVETTE.  Petrarch and Laura.

[BERGAMIN and PASQUINOT emerge.]

PASQUINOT.  See how well your plan has succeeded!  Our children
are quite mad, thanks to you!

BERGAMIN.  Your daughter, with her famous abduction, is most
aggravating.

PASQUINOT.  Your son thinks he is a hero.  He gets on my nerves.

BERGAMIN.  But the worst of it all is that they think we are two
idiotic old fools whom they have deceived.  I don't like it at all.

PASQUINOT.  Why didn't you think of it before, wise man?  I'm going
to tell them everything.

BERGAMIN.  No, please don't do that--at least not until after the
signing of the contract.  Let us not say a word until then.

PASQUINOT.  Very well.  But meantime, here we are caught in the
net of your own making.

BERGAMIN.  But my dear friend, you admired the plan!

PASQUINOT.  A fine plan, in truth!

[SYLVETTE enters gaily, with flowers in her hand.  She waves to
PERCINET in the distance, then comes down-stage.]

SYLVETTE.  Good-day, Papa.  Good-day, Father-in-law to-be!

BERGAMIN.  Good-day, daughter-in-law to-be!

SYLVETTE.  My, my, what a bad humor you are in!

BERGAMIN.  It's Pasquinot's fault--he--he--

SYLVETTE.  [Waving her flowers in BERGAMIN's face]  Sh!  Please
don't quarrel.  Of course, I understand, you can't behave quite as
old friends, and you like to quarrel a little, in a friendly way--

BERGAMIN.  Of course, our hatred was so great!

SYLVETTE.  A mortal hatred, too!  When I think what you've said
about Papa--oh, dear!  I used to sit by the wall and hear every
word!  And to think you never once suspected that I came there to
meet Percinet--

PASQUINOT.  [Ironically]  Ah, I--

SYLVETTE.  We came every day at the same hour.  [To BERGAMIN]
Ha, ha, I can still hear Percinet telling you that he was going to
marry--"most romantically"!  And he kept his word!

BERGAMIN.  [Put out]  Really? And do you think that if I had
wished--?

SYLVETTE.  Now, now, now!  I know lovers' dreams are always
realized, and that fathers who are mortal enemies always end by
falling into each other's arms.

PASQUINOT.  Oh, let me laugh!

SYLVETTE.  But we proved it!

BERGAMIN.  I could say something--

SYLVETTE.  What?

BERGAMIN.  Nothing!

SYLVETTE.  [To BERGAMIN]  You seem changed.  What do you mean?

BERGAMIN.  I mean--

PASQUINOT.  Why, with one word, we could--  [Aside]  I can't tell
her!  [He walks up-stage two or three steps.]

SYLVETTE.  Well, if you have nothing to say, why not keep still?

PASQUINOT.  [Angrily]  Keep still?  Nothing to say?  Do you
imagine that everything just happened?  How do you think people
could come into my park through the iron gates?

BERGAMIN.  Do you imagine for one instant that young ladies are
carried off like that nowadays?

SYLVETTE.  Do I--?  What are you saying?

BERGAMIN.  That will do!  It is high time you knew the truth.  I
tell you, the victory was on the side of the old men!

SYLVETTE.  But--

PASQUINOT.  In old plays the father was always the dupe.  Nowadays,
we do the duping!  Would either of you have loved the other if you
had been told to do so?  No.

SYLVETTE.  Then perhaps you suspected--?

PASQUINOT.  Of course we did.

SYLVETTE.  Our meetings?

BERGAMIN.  I heard you every time!

SYLVETTE.  But the benches?

PASQUINOT.  We put them there on purpose.

SYLVETTE.  The duel?

BERGAMIN.  A trick--prepared beforehand.

SYLVETTE.  The bravadoes?

PASQUINOT.  Actors!

SYLVETTE.  Then my abduction--?  It was all a joke!

BERGAMIN.  [Searching in his pocket]  Joke?  Here's the bill!

SYLVETTE.  [Snatching the bill from him]  Give it to me!  [She
reads]  "Straforel, Confidential affairs:  One abduction, setting
and scenery--for purposes of bringing about a marriage--"  Oh!
"Eight assistants at five francs a head; eight masks--"

BERGAMIN.  [To PASQUINOT]  I think we told her too soon!

SYLVETTE.  [Continuing]  "One sedan-chair, with porters; latest
style, with red trimmings--"  [Laughing, she throws the bill on the
table.]

PASQUINOT.  Then she isn't angry?

SYLVETTE.  [Graciously]  A charming idea!  But, truly, Monsieur
Bergamin, do you think I love Percinet merely because of your trick?

PASQUINOT.  She takes it very well.

BERGAMIN.  [To SYLVETTE]  You're not offended?

PASQUINOT.  Are you going to tell Percinet?

SYLVETTE.  Oh, no.  Men are so stupid!

BERGAMIN.  Very sensible.  But I had an idea--  [Taking out his
watch]  Now we must see about the contract.  [Offering his hand
to SYLVETTE]  We are still good friends?

SYLVETTE.  Of course!

BERGAMIN.  [Turning about once more before he goes out]  You don't
blame me, do you?

SYLVETTE.  [Sweetly]  Not in the least!  [BERGAMIN and PASQUINOT
go out.  As they leave, SYLVETTE bursts into a rage.]  How I hate
that Monsieur Bergamin!

[Enter PERCINET.]

PERCINET.  Still here?  Ah, I see; you did not want to leave this
sacred spot--

SYLVETTE.  [Sitting on the bench to the left]  Outrageous!

PERCINET.  There is where you saw me, like Amadis, put to flight
thirty of the ruffians!

SYLVETTE.  No: ten!

PERCINET.  [Going to her]  Dearest, what is the matter?  Are you
troubled?  Your eyes are not so bright as they were.  I know!
This marvelous place makes you sad sometimes.  Are you sad because
our balcony--our Verona balcony--is destroyed?

SYLVETTE.  [Impatiently] Oh, dear!

PERCINET.  But does not the wall still exist in our memories?  That
wall which cradled our love--

SYLVETTE.  [Aside:]  Will he never end!

PERCINET.  You remember not long ago, you said our story should
be put into a poem?

SYLVETTE.  Yes?

PERCINET.  Well, I have occasionally written verses.

SYLVETTE.  Are you going to write our story?

PERCINET.  Listen to this; I thought it out when I was walking.
"The Fathers who are Mortal Enemies."  First canto--

SYLVETTE.  Oh!

PERCINET.  [Ready to declaim]  Er--

SYLVETTE.  Oh!

PERCINET.  What is the matter?

SYLVETTE.  I imagine I am too happy--I'm nervous--I don't feel
well.  [She bursts into tears.]  I'll be well in a moment.  Let me
be!  [She turns her back and hides her face in a handkerchief.]

PERCINET.  [Surprised]  I'll leave you for a moment.  [Aside]
On a day like this, it's only too natural--  [He goes to the right,
sees the bill on the table, takes a pencil from his pocket, and
sits down.]  I'll just jot down those lines.  [He picks up the
bill, and starts to write; notices the writing and reads aloud]
"I, Straforel, having pretended to be killed by a sword-thrust from
a foolish young blade, hereby render account for torn clothes and
wounded pride: forty francs."  [Smiling]  What is it?  [He
continues reading to himself, and his smile dies away.]

SYLVETTE.  [Wiping her eyes]  He _would_ fall from the clouds if
he knew!  I must be careful!

PERCINET.  [Rising]  Well, well, well!

SYLVETTE.  [Going toward him]  What is it?

PERCINET.  [Hiding the bill]  Nothing.  [Aside]  Now I see why
the body was never found!

SYLVETTE.  [Turning around to show PERCINET her dress]  You've
said nothing about my dress to-day?

PERCINET.  [Preoccupied]  Blue is not becoming.  I always prefer
you in pink.

SYLVETTE.  [Aside]  What is the matter?  Can he have found out?
[She looks toward the table.]  The bill?  [She runs to the table.]

PERCINET.  What are you looking for?

SYLVETTE.  Nothing.--Now let me hear your poem.

PERCINET.  No.

SYLVETTE.  Please!

PERCINET.  No.

SYLVETTE.  But I want to hear it.

PERCINET.  The verses are not good.

SYLVETTE.  Oh!  [Aside]  I think he knows!

PERCINET.  [Aside]  I think she knows!

BOTH.  [Each to the other]  _You_ know!?  [After a pause, they
laugh.]  Ha, ha, ha!

PERCINET.  Isn't it funny?

SYLVETTE.  Very.

PERCINET.  We were made to play a farce--our fathers were the best
of friends all the time!

SYLVETTE.  Good neighbors.

PERCINET.  I'll warrant they are cousins, too!

SYLVETTE.  [Bowing]  I am about to marry my cousin!

PERCINET.  My cousin!

SYLVETTE.  How nice and respectable!

PERCINET.  Classic!

SYLVETTE.  Of course, I had dreamed of a marriage more--but it is
comforting to know that our love coincides with our--duty!

PERCINET.  And the material interests of our fathers.

SYLVETTE.  An excellent marriage, in short: a marriage of
convenience!  And our poor idyl!

PERCINET.  Gone.

SYLVETTE.  Gone!  So I'm the good little girl of the family!

PERCINET.  And I the obedient little son!  But it was only as Romeo
that I appealed to you!

SYLVETTE.  Well, you are no longer that!

PERCINET.  And do you think you are Juliet?

SYLVETTE.  Now you're bitter.

PERCINET.  And you cynical.

SYLVETTE.  If you were ridiculous, is it my fault?

PERCINET.  I at least had a partner!

SYLVETTE.  I, too!  Poor Blue Bird, you are beautifully plucked!

PERCINET.  [Bitterly]  A pre-arranged abduction!

SYLVETTE.  Farce, all of it!

PERCINET.  And I your savior!  All our poetry was bought and paid
for.  Our beautiful bubble is now a tiny fleck of soap.  Farewell,
Shakespearean lovers--we have nothing in common with you!

SYLVETTE.  Nothing!

PERCINET.  In place of a divine drama, we played an infamous parody.

SYLVETTE.  Our nightingale was a sparrow!

PERCINET.  And the immortal wall a punch-and-judy theater.  We were
the puppets, worked by our fathers.

SYLVETTE.  But how much more ridiculous we should be if we loved
each other less than we do!

PERCINET.  We must now love more than ever.

SYLVETTE.  But we do--we adore--

PERCINET.  The word is not a bit too strong.

SYLVETTE.  Love can console us.  Can it not, my treasure?

PERCINET.  Certainly, my jewel.

SYLVETTE.  Good-bye then, my dearest.

PERCINET.  Good-bye, my darling.

SYLVETTE.  I shall dream of you, my heart.

PERCINET.  And I of you.

SYLVETTE.  Good-night.  [She goes out.]

PERCINET.  So this is how I have been treated!--  But who is this?
See the long moustaches--I don't know him--

[STRAFOREL enters and walks majestically toward PERCINET.]

STRAFOREL.  [With a profound bow]  I have come to collect a small
bill.

PERCINET.  Are you an upholsterer?

STRAFOREL.  Run along, young man, and tell your papa I am waiting
for him.

PERCINET.  What is your name?

STRAFOREL.  My name is Straforel.

PERCINET.  [With a start]  He?!  This is too much!

STRAFOREL.  [Smiling]  Then you know, young man?

PERCINET.  [Throwing the bill in STRAFOREL's face]  Wretch!  It
was you!

STRAFOREL.  It was, Per Bacco!

PERCINET.  I have you at last.

STRAFOREL.  The people you kill, you see, are in the best of health.

PERCINET.  [Drawing his sword and making a pass at STRAFOREL]
You will see!

STRAFOREL.  [Parrying with his arm, like a fencing-master giving a
lesson]  Hand high!  Foot out!  Monsieur, at your age, you should
know better than that!  [He takes the sword from PERCINET with his
naked hand, and returns it as he bows.]  What, are you stopping
your fencing-lesson so soon?

PERCINET.  [Exasperated, as he takes back the sword]  I'm going
away.  Here I am treated like a child.  I shall have my revenge.
I am going to seek my romance--true romance: love-affairs, duels,
and--Ah, Don Juan, I will scandalize your ghost!  I will elope with
actresses!  [He dashes out, brandishing his sword.]

STRAFOREL.  Very well, but who is going to pay me?  [Looking in
the distance]  Stop there!  Here's someone else.

[Enter BERGAMIN and PASQUINOT, their hair and clothes ruffled, as
if they had been fighting.]

PASQUINOT.  [Readjusting his clothes and holding BERGAMIN's wig]
Here's your wig!

BERGAMIN.  And here's yours!

PASQUINOT.  After this, you can't imagine I'll--?

BERGAMIN.  I would no more live with you now than--

[Enter SYLVETTE.]

PASQUINOT.  My daughter!--Say nothing about this!

SYLVETTE.  [Throwing her arms about her father's neck]  Papa, I
can't marry Percinet!

[Enter the NOTARY and four WITNESSES.]

BERGAMIN.  The witnesses!  The devil!

WITNESSES.  What--?

STRAFOREL.  [In the midst of the tumult]  My bill!  Who is going
to pay me?  Ninety pistoles!

[Enter the GUESTS and three FIDDLERS, who play.]

BERGAMIN.  What's all this?  The guests?  Music?

[The FIDDLERS continue their minuet.]

STRAFOREL.  [To BERGAMIN]  Well?

BERGAMIN.  See Pasquinot.

STRAFOREL.  [Reading]  "For the purpose of bringing about a
marriage--"

BERGAMIN.  Well, there is to be no marriage!  Therefore I owe you
nothing!

[Enter BLAISE.]

STRAFOREL.  [To PASQUINOT]  But, Monsieur--

PASQUINOT.  What?  Pay you now that it is broken off!

BERGAMIN.  [To whom BLAISE has just whispered]  My son--run away?

SYLVETTE.  Run away?

STRAFOREL.  Well!  Well!

BERGAMIN.  Quick, follow him!  [He runs out, followed by the NOTARY
and the WITNESSES.]

SYLVETTE.  Gone!

STRAFOREL.  [Coming down-stage]  Why can't I straighten all this
out?

SYLVETTE.  This is too much!  [She goes out, followed by PASQUINOT.]

STRAFOREL.  Straforel, my son, if you want your ninety pistoles,
you must patch up this marriage!  [He goes out.  The three FIDDLERS,
left alone, continue their minuet, as the curtain falls.]

ACT III

SCENE:  The scene is the same except that the wall is being
rebuilt.  Bricks and sacks of plaster lie about.

As the curtain rises, the MASON is seen at work with his trowel.
His back is turned to the audience.  BERGAMIN and PASQUINOT, each
on his own side of the wall, watch the progress of the work.

The MASON.  [Singing at his work]  Tra la la--

BERGAMIN.  These masons are so slow!

PASQUINOT.  Good!

BERGAMIN.  How he slaps the mortar!

PASQUINOT.  There goes another brick!

[The MASON sings a number of trills.]

PASQUINOT.  Sings well, but works very slowly!  By to-morrow the
wall will be at least two feet high!

BERGAMIN.  I'm impatient to see it higher!

PASQUINOT.  What is that you say, Monsieur?

BERGAMIN.  I was not addressing you.  [A pause.]  What do you do
evenings after dinner?

PASQUINOT.  Nothing--and you?

BERGAMIN.  Nothing.  [Another pause.  They bow and walk about
again.]

PASQUINOT.  [Stopping]  Any news from your son?

BERGAMIN.  No--he is still away.

PASQUINOT.  He will return soon:  his money will surely give out.

BERGAMIN.  Thank you.  [They bow again, and walk.]

PASQUINOT.  Now that the wall is being built again, Monsieur, I
should be glad to see you from time to time.

BERGAMIN.  Thank you.  Perhaps I shall come.  [They bow.]

PASQUINOT.  Tell me, now, will you play _piquet_?

BERGAMIN.  I beg your pardon--I don't know--

PASQUINOT.  I invite you!

BERGAMIN.  To tell the truth, I prefer _besigue_--

PASQUINOT.  Then come at once.

BERGAMIN.  [Following PASQUINOT, who goes out]  You owe me ten
sous from the last time.  [Turning round]  Work hard, mason!

The MASON.  Tra la la la la!

PASQUINOT.  Beautiful voice!  [They disappear.]

[When they are gone, the MASON turns round, and takes off his hat:
he is STRAFOREL.]

STRAFOREL.  Now for the work of reconstruction!  [He sits down on
the row or two of bricks.]  The young man is still off on his quest
for adventure and romance.  Life must be giving him a splendid bath
of disillusion.  I can see him as he returns, his tail between his
legs.  Now I am working on Sylvette--she, too, will soon be cured.
[He takes a letter from his pocket and puts it in the hollow of a
tree-trunk.  SYLVETTE appears at the back.]  It's she!  Now to work!

SYLVETTE.  [Looking anxiously about]  Not a soul.  [She lays her
muslin scarf on the bench to the left.]  Will the letter be there
to-day as usual?  [She goes toward the tree.]  Every day some
gallant has left one for me.  [She thrusts her hand into the
hollow.]  Ah, here is my mail!  [She takes the letter, opens it and
reads.]  "Sylvette, heart of marble, this is the last letter you
will find in this tree.  Why have you not answered me?"  Ah, what
style!  "The love that gnaws at my vitals!"  Monsieur Percinet has
gone forth into the great world, and he is right.  I shall do as
he has done.  How can I possibly stay here and die of ennui?  Now
let him come, I am ready to fly with him!  I almost love him already!

STRAFOREL.  [Rising from his work, and in a voice of thunder]
Here am I!

SYLVETTE.  [Screaming]  Help!  Percinet!  Man, not another step!

STRAFOREL.  [Gallantly]  Why this hostile attitude?  I am the man
whose letter you love, I am he whose words have had the honor of
pleasing you, and upon whose love you just called.  Come, fly with
me!

SYLVETTE.  [Not knowing what to do]  Man!

STRAFOREL.  You think I am a mason?  Charming!  Know, then, that
I am the Marquis D'Astafiorquercita.  My heart is languishing for
you, I seek to color my drab existence with a few pigments from
your own.  I must travel--but with you.  That is why I have
penetrated into your garden, disguised as a mason!  [He throws off
his workman's clothes and hat, and appears in a dazzling costume.
His wig is powdered and his moustache bristles.]

SYLVETTE.  Monsieur!

STRAFOREL.  I learned your story from a man named Straforel.  I
felt at once a mad, unreasoning love for the victim of that
unfortunate affair.

SYLVETTE.  Marquis!

STRAFOREL.  Don't be afraid of me.  That fellow who played the
trick on you--I killed him!

SYLVETTE.  Killed him!

STRAFOREL.  With a single blow!

SYLVETTE.  Monsieur!

STRAFOREL.  I understand you, you who have never been understood.
You want romance, do you not?  Romance at any price?

SYLVETTE.  But, Marquis--

STRAFOREL.  To-night we elope!

SYLVETTE.  Monsieur!

STRAFOREL.  We shall go away, never to return.

SYLVETTE.  Monsieur!

STRAFOREL.  My dream is realized.  You consent!  To-night!  If your
father objects, so much the worse for him!

SYLVETTE.  Monsieur!

STRAFOREL.  Let them follow us--I know how to deal with pursuers.
In some far land, at last, we shall live happily in a little cottage!

SYLVETTE.  But I--

STRAFOREL.  For I am poor.  I have nothing.  We shall live on bread
soaked in sweet tears!

SYLVETTE.  But, I tell you--

STRAFOREL.  We shall thrive on misfortune--with you I shan't care
for anything else.  A tent, perhaps--

SYLVETTE.  A tent?

STRAFOREL.  Of nothing at all--just the stars!

SYLVETTE.  Oh, I--

STRAFOREL.  Why, you're trembling--possibly you don't want to go
so far away?  Then we shall hide somewhere--

SYLVETTE.  But, Monsieur, you are mistaken!

STRAFOREL.  Let people say what they will!

SYLVETTE.  Good Heavens!

STRAFOREL.  I shall spend every moment of my time telling you how
I love you!

SYLVETTE.  Monsieur--

STRAFOREL.  Ours shall be a long life of poetry.  And I shall be
furiously jealous!

SYLVETTE.  Monsieur--

STRAFOREL.  Are you afraid now?

SYLVETTE.  Heavens, what a lesson for me!

STRAFOREL.  Ha, now you look like a little boarding-school miss.
Tell me, shall we fly together, or shall I go alone?

SYLVETTE.  Monsieur--

STRAFOREL.  I understand.  I see you are strong: we shall go
together.  I shall throw you across my saddle.  No sedan-chair--
they are used only in make-believe abductions!  I return soon!
[He goes up-stage.]

SYLVETTE.  Monsieur, let me tell you--

STRAFOREL.  I must get my horse and my mantle!

SYLVETTE.  [Deeply distressed]  Monsieur!!

STRAFOREL.  [With a sweeping gesture]  We shall travel from land
to land.  My dream at last.  I shall return and take you away,
never to return!

SYLVETTE.  [Gasping]  Never to return!

STRAFOREL.  You shall live by the side of your adored one, by the
side of him who loved you before he set eyes on you.  [As he is
about to leave, she falls onto the bench, and he says aside]  It's
now time for you, Percinet!  [He goes out.]

SYLVETTE.  [Opening her eyes after a moment]  Monsieur le marquis--
No, not across the saddle, please.  I couldn't do that!  Please,
please let me stay home.  I _am_ a little boarding-school miss!
Why--he's gone!  Marquis!  Heavens, what an awful dream!  [Another
pause, then she rises.]  Romance?  Was it not romance that you
craved not so long ago?  It has come, and are you afraid?  Love,
stars, a cottage.  Yes, I did want it--but only a little--like
seasoning in a stew!  This is too much--I couldn't stand it.  [The
sun is setting.  SYLVETTE takes up her scarf, which she had left
on the bench, and puts it over her head.]  Who knows whether--?

[PERCINET appears.  He is in rags, and his arm is in a sling.  He
looks ill, and can scarcely walk.]

PERCINET.  [Not seeing SYLVETTE]  I have had nothing to eat since
yesterday--I can hardly walk.  I'm not proud now!  I want no more
adventures.  [He sits down on the wall.  His hat falls from his
eyes, and reveals his identity.  SYLVETTE sees him.]

SYLVETTE.  You?!  [He rises, and stands looking at her.]  What has
happened to you?  Can it be--?

PERCINET.  [Piteously]  It can!

SYLVETTE.  [Wringing her hands]  Heavens!

PERCINET.  I resemble somewhat the prodigal son, do I not?  [He
totters.]

SYLVETTE.  You can't stand up!

PERCINET.  I am so tired.

SYLVETTE.  [Looking at his arm, with a cry]  Wounded!

PERCINET.  Can you pity the ungrateful?

SYLVETTE.  [Severely]  Only fathers kill fatted calves.  Still,
that wounded arm?

PERCINET.  Oh, I assure you it's not serious.

SYLVETTE.  But what have you been doing, Monsieur Vagabond, all
this while?

PERCINET.  Nothing very creditable, Sylvette.  [He coughs.]

SYLVETTE.  You are coughing?

PERCINET.  Walking the damp roads at night.

SYLVETTE.  What strange clothes you have!

PERCINET.  Mine were stolen, and the thieves left me these.

SYLVETTE.  [Ironically]  How many fortunes did you find?

PERCINET.  Sylvette, please say nothing about that.

SYLVETTE.  You must have scaled many a balcony?

PERCINET.  [Aside]  I nearly broke my neck once!

SYLVETTE.  Guitar in hand!  And what nocturnes and serenades you
must have sung!

PERCINET.  Which earned for me more than one bucket of water!

SYLVETTE.  But I see you have been wounded in a real duel?

PERCINET.  It came near being mortal.

SYLVETTE.  And now you return to us--?

PERCINET.  Thoroughly worn-out.

SYLVETTE.  Yes, but you have at least found romance and poetry?

PERCINET.  No--I was seeking afar what was here all the time.
Don't make fun of me: I adore you!

SYLVETTE.  Even after our disillusion?

PERCINET.  What difference does that make?

SYLVETTE.  But our fathers played an abominable trick on us.

PERCINET.  What of it?  What I feel in my heart is real.

SYLVETTE.  They pretended to hate each other.

PERCINET.  Did we pretend that we loved?

SYLVETTE.  The wall was a punch-and-judy theater--you said so
yourself.

PERCINET.  I did, Sylvette, but it was blasphemy.  Ah, wall, you
gave us a  divine setting, with moonlight and stars, flowers and
vines, the four winds for music, and Shakespeare for prompter!
Yes, our fathers made us go through the motions, but it was Love
that made us speak: _it_ pulled the strings!

SYLVETTE.  [Sighing]  That's true, but we loved because we believed
it was wicked!

PERCINET.  And it was!  Only the intention counts, and thinking we
were guilty, we were!

SYLVETTE.  Really?

PERCINET.  Really, my dear, we were infamous.  It was wrong of us
to love.

SYLVETTE.  [Seating herself beside him]  Very wrong?  [She changes
her tone, as she rises and goes away.]  Still, I wish the danger
had been a little more real.

PERCINET.  It _was_ real, because we believed it so.

SYLVETTE.  No:  my abduction, like your duel, was false.

PERCINET.  Was your fear false?  If you were afraid then, it was
as if you were really being abducted.

SYLVETTE.  No, the dear remembrance is gone.  All those masks and
torches, the soft music, the duel; it is too cruel to think that
Straforel prepared it all.

PERCINET.  But who prepared the spring night?  Was that Straforel?
Did he also sprinkle the sky with stars?  Did he plant roses, did
he create the gray of evening and the blue mists of night?  Did he
have anything to do with the rising of that huge pink star?

SYLVETTE.  No, of course--

PERCINET.  Was it his doing that we were two children of twenty,
on a spring night, and that we loved each other?  We loved, that
was the charm--all the charm!

SYLVETTE.  All the--?  That's true, yet--

PERCINET.  A tear?  Am I then--forgiven?

SYLVETTE.  I have always loved you, my poor dear.

PERCINET.  At last I have you again!  [He takes SYLVETTE's scarf
and plays with it.]  What beautiful shades and lights in this
gorgeous satin.

SYLVETTE.  What satin?

PERCINET.  Oh, nothing!  Nothing!

SYLVETTE.  But it's only muslin!

PERCINET.  [Kneeling and kissing her hand]  No, it is everything!

SYLVETTE.  [Falling into his arms]  See?  I know now that poetry
and romance are in the hearts of lovers; they have nothing to do
with other things.

PERCINET.  That is true, Sylvette.  I have seen what ought to be
poetry and romance, but it wasn't--to me!

SYLVETTE.  And what was prepared for and arranged beforehand was
real, though it was contrived for us by others.

PERCINET.  We can weave realities on a false frame.

SYLVETTE.  How foolish we were to seek elsewhere for romance, when
it was our own hearts!

[STRAFOREL appears, followed by the two fathers, and shows them
SYLVETTE and PERCINET in each other's arms.]

STRAFOREL.  Ah!

BERGAMIN.  My son!  [He embraces PERCINET.]

STRAFOREL.  Now do I get my money?

PASQUINOT.  [To his daughter]  Do you love him?

SYLVETTE.  Yes.

STRAFOREL.  [To BERGAMIN]  Shall I have my money?

BERGAMIN.  You shall.

SYLVETTE.  [Trembling as she hears STRAFOREL's voice and recognizes
it]  But--that--voice--the Marquis D'Asta--fior--

STRAFOREL.  [Bowing] --quercita.  Yes, my dear Mademoiselle.  'Tis
Straforel.  Pardon my excessive zeal.  I have at least taught you
how tiresome and hollow and useless real adventures are.  You
might, like this young man, have had your share, but I allowed you
to see them in prospect through the magic-lantern of my imagination.

PERCINET.  What is this?

SYLVETTE.  [Quickly]  Nothing, nothing.  I love you!

BERGAMIN.  [Pointing to the wall]  And to-morrow we shall knock
down these few rows of bricks!

PASQUINOT.  Yes, away with it!

STRAFOREL.  No, let us finish it; it is indispensable.

SYLVETTE.  [Gathering them all about her]  Let us say no more
about it!
