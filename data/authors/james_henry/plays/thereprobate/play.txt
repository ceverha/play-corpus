ACT FIRST 



Whitsuntide. The drawing-room at Mr. Bonsor's villa at 
Hampton Court. Wide double doors, across the upper angle on 
the right, open from the hall and other parts of the house. Half 
way down on the right a door to the adjacent rooms. On the left, 
far up, at the other angle, a wide French window, open to the lawn. 
Further down on the left the door to the library. A table with 
drawers and several objects upon it somewhat to the left, near the 
front. More to the right a table for a tea-tray. To the right, below 
the lower door, a tall cabinet. The room old-fashioned but cheerful, 
comfortable but slightly severe. Plenty of chintz and mahogany ; 
wall-paper, hung with steel-engravings, of 1850. An old bachelor's 
house ; the whole aspect ugly. 

Enter Cubit and Mrs. Freshvillb from the hall, he backing down a litttle 
before her as if she may be forcing her way. Mrs. Freshvillb smart and 
showy, with hair conspicuously "golden." 

CUBIT. 

Certainly, ma'am, you may come in ; but Captain 
Chanter's positively not in the house. 

MRS. FRESHVILLB. 

Where then ts Captain Chanter ? 

CUBIT. 

He may have gone up to town. 



196 THE REPROBATE 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

For what purpose ? 

CUBIT. 

I haven't the least idea. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Is there any one in the house who has an idea ? 

CUBIT. 
Oh yes — lots of them ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, looking at him a moment. 

They must be rubbish. Any women ? 

CUBIT, vague and slightly shocked. 

Women, ma'am? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Petticoats. All men ? 

CUBIT, clearer. 

Two men and a boy. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, looking round her, taking everything in. 

What sort of a boy ? 

CUBIT. 

In buttons — to do the knives. 



ACT FIRST 197 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Oh that sort ! They're a fraud ! (Seeing Pitt Brunt at 

the open window, through which Brunt steps in from the lawn.) WhO S 

this person ? 

£nter Pitt Brunt. 
CUBIT, announcing. 

Mr. Pitt Brunt ! 

PITT BRUNT, coming down ; privately to Cubit, while Mrs. Fresiiville 
seats herself aft the right of the table on the left. 

Who's that person ? 

CUBIT. 

No idea, sir ! 

Exit Cubit to the hall. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 
I'm waiting — I'm awfully tired. 

PITT BRUNT, in a modified boating-suit, with a double eyeglass, very 
neat and deliberate, and slightly hesitant and puzzled. 

A — ^tired of waiting ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Not yet — in your company ! Been on the river ? 

PITT BRUNT. 
I put in an hour each day. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

/ used to put in hours — the dear old river ! 



198 THE REPROBATE 

PITT BRUNT. 
It's hygienic — if you're moderate. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

I airCt moderate ! I never was ! 

PITT BRUNT. 

It's best, you know, to be safe. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, looking at him an instant, wliile he smiles com- 
placently ; then rising suddenly. 

Do you think you are ? 

PITT BRUNT, startled a little, retreating a step, then smiling at her again. 

I'm not very sure ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, laughing. 

If you were, I'd do for you ! Are you staying in the 
house ? 

PITT BRUNT. 

No — ^are you ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 
Till I've done what I've come for. (Then abrupt, familiar. 

What have you come for ? 

PITT BRUNT. 

I put in an hour each day. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Here too ? Why, you must have a time-table ! 



ACT FIRST 199 

PITT BRUNT. 
My life is thoroughly organised. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Mine is deliciously irregular. 

PITT BRUNT. 

Ah, but you're not in the House ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, vague. 

What house ? 

PITT BRUNT. 

The House of Commons ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Do you mean you are ? 

PITT BRUNT. 

I sit for Blackport. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

At your ridiculous age ? 

PITT BRUNT, with dignity. 

My constituents have never inquired it. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

That's the sort of people I like ! Where are such ducks 
to be found ? 

PITT BRUNT. 

On the banks of the Smutt, in the extreme north. I 
meet them there, I address them, in a day or two; 



200 THE REPROBATE 

but in' the meantime I'm spending the Whitsuntide 
recess at Teddington. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

And what are you doing at Teddington ? 

PITT BRUNT. 

I'm reading. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Reading what ? 

PITT BRUNT, after an hesitation 

Everything ! 

Re-enter Cubit from' the hall. 
CUBIT. 

Mr. Bonsor has come in, sir. 

PITT BRUNT. 
And Miss Amber ? 

•CUBIT. 

Not arrived. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, to Cubit, as he waits. 
You may go. (Exit Ct- bit to the hall. To Pitt Brunt, as he takes up 
his hat to follow him.) YoU may not ! (Then as Bru.nt puts down 

his hat.) Who in the world^s Miss Amber ? 

PITT BRUNT. 

Mr. Bonsor's niece. 



ACT FIRST 201 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 
And who in the world's Mr. Bonsor ? 

PITT BRUNT, surprised at the question. 

The master of this house. One of my strongest sup- 
porters. He has interests at Blackport — I look after 
them. I have interests here — 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, interrupting. 

And he looks after them ! Tit for tat ! Is he married ? 

PITT BRUNT. 

Not yet. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

There's always time ! What's his age ? 

PITT BRU^^T, hesitating. 

He's getting on ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

And are you 1 

PITT BRUNT. 

Remarkably well ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Remarkably well married ? 

PITT BRUNT. 

Not married at all ! I mean I'm getting on. 



202 THE REPROBATE 

MRS. FRESHVILLE 

I'm glad to hear it Is she good-looking ? 

PITT BRUNT. 

Who, madam ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE 

Mr. Bonsoi^s niece. 

PITT BRUNT. 

I should use a still stronger expression. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Always use the strongest there is ! Is she one of your 
interests here ? 

PITT BRUNT, smiling. 

The greatest ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

And Mr. Bonsor looks after it ? 

PITT BRUNT. 

He desires our union. 

MR&amp; FRESHVILLE. 

" Union " is tame. Where is she to arrive from ? 

PITT BRUNT. 

From the continent, where she has spent most of her 
life, and where — in Germany, six months ago — I was 
so fortunate as to make her acquaintance. 



ACT FIRST 203 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, to herself. 

Germany ? Then it's not she / (To brunt.) Isn't there 
another woman ? 

PITT BRUNT, with simpering ardour. 

There's no other woman ! 

MR&amp; FRESHVILLE. 

For you — I see ! But for him ? 

PITT BRUNT. 

For whom ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, checking herself, reconsidering. 

Never mind whom ! (As she looks about her she suddenly spies, on 
the table on right, a roll of unfinished embroidery, on which she pounces. 

Holding it up.) Whose uutidiuess is that ? 

PUT BRUNT, looking at it with his glasses. 

That embroidery ? Perhaps it's Mrs. Doubleday's. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

And who on earth is Mrs. Doubleday ? 

PITT BRUNT. 

A lady in the house. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, with a little vindictive shake of the embroidery, 
which she clutches. 

Then I've got her ! Rich ? 



204 THE REPROBATE 

PITT BRUNT. 
Five thousand a year. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Good-looking ? 

PITT BRUNT, after an instant, 

I should use a still weaker expression. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, promptly suggestive. 

Hideous ? 

PITT BRUNT, hesitating again. 

Fat. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

And old — horribly old ? (Pressing.) How old ? 

PITT BRUNT, thinking. 

She's getting on. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE 

She ought to be ashamed of herself! Whereas her 
husband ? 

PUT BRUNT, grave. 

Beneath the sod. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, gay. 

Like mine ! What then is she doing here ? 

PITT BRUNT. 

Spending a month. 



ACT FIRST 205 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 



With a bachelor ? 

PITT BRUNT. 
They have a common object. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

What sort of object ? 



A child. 

Hers? 

His! 

Mr. Bonsor's? 



PITT BRUNT. 
MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

PITT BRUNT. 
MRS. FRESHVILLE. 



PITT BRUNT, with a somewhat scandalised movement of repudiation. 

Mr. Doubleday's — ^the son of his first marriage. This 
lady, the stepmother, is one of the joint guardians. As 
Mr. Bonsor is the other, they have often to meet. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

How old is the child ? 

PITl BRUNT. 

He's getting on, 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

You seem all to be getting on ! 



2o6 THE REPROBATE 

PITT BRUNT. 
He's about thirty. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Then why the deuce guardians ? 

PITT BRUNT. 

It's a pecuHar case — he's vicious. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Stuff— I don't believe it ! 

PITT BRUNT. 

There are such men. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

You should give them their head ! 

PITT BRUNT. 

Doubleday can't be trusted. He requires the iron hand 
— and he knows it 1 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

I see — like my young man ! 

PITT BRUNT, vague. 

Yours ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

He requires it — and he knows it. But I forgot — -you 
don't ! 



ACT FIRST 207 

PITT BRUNT. 
Permit me then to retire. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 
Send me the butler ! (Exit Pitt Brunt to the hall. Unfolding the 
embroidery, she looks at it a moment.) HideOUS ! the WOrk of an 

Ugly woman. Never mind, it's evidence ! (Roiling the 

embroidery up with dedsion, she thrusts it into her pocket.) I See my 

way. No warning a pounce ! (Seeing Cubit, she extracts her 

purse from a small smart reticule which she carries on her arm, and takes a gold 
coin from it. Re-enter Cubit from the hall. Having put the reticule upon the 
table on the left and the purse into her pocket, she hands the coin to Cubit.) 

Can you change me that ? 

CUBIT, with the sovereign, mystified. 

IVe only sixpence. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, taking the sixpence which Cubit has produced. 

Sixpence will do. 

CUBIT, still more mystified. 

And the rest ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, significant, with something very like a wink. 

Enjoy the rest ! 

CUBIT, to himself, gleefully, while he promptly pockets the sovereign. 

Nineteen-and-six ? What a rum tip ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Vm awfully thirsty. Is there any place near ? 



2o8 THE REPROBATE 

CUBIT. 
/ could give you something — for the money ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE 

The money's for something else — the money's to hold 
your tongue. 

CUBIT. 

Hold it to the Captain ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE 

Don't mention me — see ? 

CUBIT. 

I see. But who'll hold Mr. Brunt's ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

I'm already his secret : I feel I am ! Good-bye. 

CUBIT. 

I could throw in a glass of sherry. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

I loathe sherry. I'm coming back. 

CUBIT. 

Let me show you the place. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, motioning him back 

I always find the place ! Don't attract attention ! - 

Exit Mrs. FRESHVILLE to the hall. 



ACT FIRST 209 

CUBIT, alone, looking after her. 

It'll be a near thing if you don't ! Fd remark her any- 
where ! (Perceiving her reticule on the table.) HuUo ! haS she 
left me another souvenir ? (Taking up the reticule and hesitating 

while he looks at it.) Shall I go after her ? No — I'll give it 
to her when she comes back. (Sniffing at it.) My favourite 

scent what-dO-yOU-Call-*era ! (Startled, seeing Mr. BoNSOR, and 

inunediately dropping the reticule on the table.) Oh ! 

Enter Mr. Bonsor by the lower door on the right. 
MR. BONSOR, who has seen his movement. 

To whom does that article belong ? 

CUBIT. 

I was just wondering, sir. 

MR. BONSOR. 

Is your nose your organ of wonder ? I seem myself to 
become aware of the recent presence of a female. 

CUBIT. 
A lady who has just gone, sir. 

MR. BONSOR. 

Gone where ? 

CUBIT. 

No idea, sir. 

MR. BONSOR. 

What did she want ? 

CUBIT. 

She didn't seem to know ! 

VOL. II p 



2IO THE REPROBATE 

MR. BONSOR 
To whom was her visit presumably addressed ? 

CUBIT. 

Couldn't make out, sir ! cxo himseit) Nineteen-and-six ! 
WhatTlArgo? 

MR BONSOR. to himseU; strode 

To Paul ? (To Cubit.) Did she make no observation ? 

CUBIT. 

She observed that she'd come back. 

MR BONSOR. to himsel£ 

Is he at it again? cto Cubit.) When may we expect her ? 

CUBIT. 

Really can t say, sir ; but when she comes — 

MR. BONSOR 

Let me instantly know. (Looldng for a moment, with his glasses, 
without approaching it, at the reticule which Cubit has restored to its place on 
the table on the left.) Let me examine that object. (Cubit pre- 
sents him with the reticule, which, while Cubit holds it, he continues, without 
touching it, to look at in the same way.) Ruby VClvCt ? Ostcn- 

tatious. 

CUBIT. 

Slightly scented, sir. Shall I remove it ? 
MR. BONSOR. 

Not offensive. You may leave it (After cubit has again 

placed the reticule on the table.) Where is MrS. Doublcday ? 



ACT FIRST 211 

CUBIT. 
Visiting the palace, sir. 

MR. BONSOR. 

Again ? She visited the palace yesterday. 

CUBIT. 

Great historical interest, sir. Often spend an hour there 
myself. 

MR. BONSOR, in his reflections. 

Not alone, I suppose. 

CUBIT, hesitating an instant, smiling. 

Usually with a companion, sir. 

MR. BONSOR, aloof. 

I'm not interested in your companions. I allude to 
Mrs. Doubleday. 

CUBIT. 

Beg your pardon, sir. Her companion would probably 
be the Captain. 

MR. BONSOR. 

I thought Captain Chanter was to go to London. 

CUBIT, smiling. 

/ didn't, sir. He was out with her yesterday. 

MR. BONSOR, struck, prompt. 

Was he ? (Then dry.) I didn't ask you to watch their 
movements. Is Mr. Paul with them ! 



212 THE REPROBATE 

CUBIT. 

They don't take him, sir. He might watch their move- 
ments ! 

MR. BONSOR, to himself. 

It's the time to watch his! (ToCubxt.) Where is Mr. 
Paul? 

CUBIT. 

In the library, sir. 

MR. BONSOR. 
Then call him immediately. 

CUBIT, without moving. 

I might call him all day, sir — he would never be able 
to come. 

MR. BONSOR. 

What's the matter with him ? 

CUBIT. 

He's locked in. Mrs. Doubleday has the key. 

MR. BONSOR. 

Oh yes, I forgot ! (Feeling in his pocket.) I Carry duplicates. 

(Producing a key and giving it to Cubit.) Let him OUt. 
CUBIT, to himself. 

One would think he was a domestic animal ! 

Exit Cubit, with the key, to the library. 
MR. BONSOR, alone, taking up the reticule. 

A mysterious female, with a meretricious appendage? 



ACT FIRST 213 

Why not state her business? I hate anything under- 
hand. (Trying to open the bag.) Confound the Catch ! 
(Opening it.) A photOgraph ? (Taking one out of the bag.) Merci- 
ful powers — it's Paul ! What fresh connection has he 
formed, with all our safeguards? And what's this 
written on the back ? " Dudley — to his Nina ! " She's 
his Nina, of course, but why is he her Dudley? Has 
he an alias — like a burglar ? What dreadful revelations ! 
Shall I confront him with this ? No, I'll conceal it — 

I'll confer with my associate. (SUps the photograph into his breast- 
pocket ; thrusts the reticule into the cabinet on the right. Enter Paul Doublb- 
DAY, from the library, with a book in his hand. To himself, seeing him.) 

Dudley ! 

PAUL. 

Oh, Mr. Bonsor, is this a book I may read ? 

MR.^ BONSOR, with the book. 

The Experience of Life? Decidedly not — it doesn't 
sound safe ! 

PAUL. 

Shall I put it back ? 

MR. BONSOR. 
By no means. (Looking at him strangely.) Fil pUt it back ! 

Have you perused any portion of it ? 

PAUL. 

Not a word — I waited to ask you. 

MR. BONSOR. 

Then how have you been occupied ? 



214 THE REPROBATE 

PAUL, mdancholy. 

I haven't been occupied ! 

MR BONSOR, significant. 

We must occupy you ! 

PAUL. 

Do, Mr. Bonsor — I so want to fill the hours ! 



MR. BONSOR. 

You say that in a tone — 



PAUL, conciliatory, explanatory. 

The tone of conviction, Mr. Bonsor! I've tried to 
speak of it to Mamma, but Mamma is occupied. 

MR. BONSOR. 

The occupation we shall propose for you is not the same 
as that which now engrosses your mamma. 

PAUL. 

Oh, yes — I don't mean f/uif/ 

MR. BONSOR. 

It's comparatively legitimate — for Mrs. Doubleday. 

PAUL. 
Yes, and it must be so jolly ! (Then on a movement of Mr. 

Bonsor's, quick.) When it is legitimate ! 



ACT FIRST 215 

MR. BONSOR. 
When it is we may perhaps concede that ! But there 
are cases in which it isn't. I needn't remind you that 
you've forfeited — 

PAUL, with a sigh. 

Oh, I know what I've forfeited ! 

MR. BONSOR. 

I needn't remind you that our confidence in you isn't all 
that we could wish. 

PAUL, genuinely meek. 

You do remind me, Mr. Bonsor. 

MR. BONSOR. 

Occasionally, perhaps — for it's indispensable. 

PAUL. 

Yes — it's indispensable ! 

MR BONSOR. 

Such an occasion has now presented itself. If I just 
sent for you, it's to call your attention to the propriety 
of another sacrifice. 

PAUL, pleading. 

Another, Mr. Bonsor? 

MR. BONSOR. 

I count upon you to make it. 



2i6 THE REPROBATE 

PAUL, palling himself together. 

Well— 111 make it ! 

MR. BONSOR. 

You know our system — your mother's and mine. 
(Complacent.) The more sacrifices you make, the easier it 
is to make 'em ! 

PAUL. 

They come very easy now, Mr. Bonsor. 

MR. BONSOR. 

The present occasion will perhaps be something of a 
test. 

PAUL. 

There's no test, Mr. Bonsor, that I shrink from ! 

MR. BONSOR, still more complacent. 

You perceive then the success of our system ! 

PAUL, virtuous, like a prize pupil. 

It works, Mr. Bonsor — in perfection ! 

MR. BONSOR 

There's a young lady about to arrive here. 

PAUL. 

Yes, Mr. Bonsor. 

MR. BONSOR. 

My niece, Miss Amber, who has been living abroad. 
She has come to spend three months with me — I've 
very particular views for her. What I want you to 



ACT FIRST 217 

understand is that I look to you not to interfere with 
them. 

PAUL. 

Tell me what they are, Mr. Bonsor, and I will regulate 
myself accordingly. 

MR. BONSOR. 

I don't see my way to describe them to you correctly as 
anything but matrimonial. 

PAUL, with continued docility. 

You wish me to marry her ? 

MR. BONSOR, shocked. 

Not for worlds ! I wish you to do the very opposite. 

PAUL, vague. 

The very opposite ? Make up to her without intentions ? 

MR. BONSOR. 

Not make up to her at all ! She's guileless — she's 
fresh — she's pure. Let her remain so ! 

PAUL. 

You mean that I'm not to speak to her ? 

MR. BONSOR, stern. 

Never — till she speaks to you, (To himself.) Dl take care 
she doesn't ! 

PAUL, following closely. 

Then I may answer her ? 



2l8 THE REPROBATE 

MR. BONSOR. 
With extreme reserve. 

PAUL, as if learning his lesson. 

With extreme reserve. Is she possessed of — a — 
personal attractions ? 

MR. BONSOR. 

Unfortunately. 

PAUL, with intense assent. 

Unfortunately ! 

MR. BONSOR. 
Fortunately you are not ! 

PAUL, with intenser assent. 

Fortunately ! — And is her future husband ? 

MR. BONSOR. 

Her future husband is that rising young star of his 
party, Mr. Pitt Brunt. 

PAUL, precipitate. 

Oh, he's not beautiful ! 

MR. BONSOR, pointed. 

No, but he's good ! 

PAUL, checked, humiliated. 

Yes — that's everything ! 



ACT FIRST 219 

MR. BONSOR. 
IVe sent him to the station to meet Blanche. 

PAUL, alert, hi spite of himself. 

Is her name Blanche ? 

MR. BONSOR, severe. 

Youll have no occasion to pronounce it ! (Looking at his 
watch.) I'm also expecting your mother's return. 

PAUL, somewhat rueful. 

So am /, Mr. Bonsor ! 

MR. BONSOR, significant. 

She forgets herself ! 

PAUL, reassuring, yet ominous. 

Oh, she'll remember me ! 

MR. BONSOR. 
I hope so ! You constitute, in her absence, a responsi- 
bility of which I feel the weight ! (Deliberating.) I don't 
quite know what to do with you. 

PAUL, passive. 

Whatever you like, Mr. Bonsor ! 

MR. BONSOR, significant. 

There are many things to consider. 



2ao THE REPROBATE 

PAUL. 
Shall I return to the library ? 

MR. BONSOR, dubious, taking up the book given him by Paul and turning 
over a page or two. 

Not till I've weeded it out ! (Tosses down the book as if with a 
ense of contamination.) 

PAUL, suggestive. 

Mamma sometimes keeps me in her room. 

MR. BONSOR, considering. 

Tm afraid that ground is forbidden me. (Austere.) I 
never enter your mother's apartment. 

PAUL. 

Mightn't you put me in yours ? 

MR. BONSOR. 

That ground would be forbidden her^ should she have 
occasion to visit you. 

PAUL. 

She sometimes confines me in my own little room. 

MR. BONSOR. 

Your own little room's the best place for you. I'll ring 
for Cubit to convey you there. 

PAUL, angelic. 

Let me ring ! (Rings.) May I come down to tea ? 



ACT FIRST 221 

MR. BONSOR. 

I don't know that today it will be advisable. 

PAUL, venturing to plead. 

I'm uncommonly thirsty, Mr. Bonsor. 
MR. BONSOR. 

We're acquainted with some of the aberrations of your 
thirst — which it is one of the leading features of our 
system to keep under control. 

PAUL. 

Dear Mr. Bonsor, tea isn't an aberration ! (Seeing cubit.) 
Here it is ! 



Re-enter Cubit at the lower door on the right, followed by a footman 
with a tea-tray. 



CUBIT, to Mr. Bonsor. 

Tea, sir. 

MR. BONSOR. 

Put it down. (The footman deposits the tray and retires. While he is 
doing so Blanche Amber appears, unperceived by the others, at the open 

window, on the lawn.) And take Mr. Paul to his room. 

Enter Blanche Amber. 
BLANCHE, precipitate, to Cubit. 

Oh, I say — please don't! 

MR. BONSOR, startled, meeting and embracing her. 

Dearest child ! Where's Pitt Brunt ? 



222 THE REPROBATE 

BLANCHE. 
I left him behind — I came across the lawn. We walked 
from the station — my maid has my things. 

CUBIT, annottodng, as Pitt Brunt appears at the window 

Mr. Pitt Brunt ! 

Re-enter Pitt Brunt, from the lawn. 
PITT BRUNT, sUghtly dignified and injured, to Blanchb. 

I should have been glad to pursue my explanation. 

BLANCHE, laughing. 

Pursue it — but don't pursue me 1 

MR. BONSOR, to Brunt. 

You can pursue everything here. 

BLANCHE, who has been looking at Paul. 

Oh, not all at once, please ! 

MR. BONSOR, cheerful. 

There'll be plenty of time ! 

PITT BRUNT, hopeful. 

Plenty of time ! 

MR. BONSOR. 

Delighted to welcome you at last, Blanche. 

BLANCHE. 

So happy to arrive, at last, dear uncle, and to be already 
(looking round her) SO charmed With your surroundings ! 



ACT FIRST 223 

CUBIT, to Mr. BoNSOR 

Beg your pardon, sir — am I to remove Mr. Paul ? 

BLANCHE, smiling, to Mr. Bonsor. 

Won't you let me plead for him ? 

PITT BRUNT, to Paul. 

Oh, how d'ye do, Doubleday ? I didn't notice you ! 

PAUL, ingenuously delighted, privately to Pitt Brunt. 

Miss Amber does ! 

BLANCHE, privately to Mr. Bonsor. 

Forgive my rash interference — Mr. Brunt has told me 
all about him. 

MR. BONSOR. 
It was to warn you in time. (To Cubit.) Mr. Paul will 
first have his tea. 

BLANCHE, approaching the tea-tray. 

And mayn't I have mine ? 

MR. BONSOR. 
Won't you have, after your journey, something more 
invigorating — a glass of wine ? 

CUBIT. 

I've brought wine, sir. (Mr. Bonsor signifies to Cubit that nothing 
more is wanted, on which Cubit goes out by lower door on the right.) 

BLANCHE, to Paul, seeing him approach the tea-table. 

Will you give me a glass of wine ? 



224 THE REPROBATE 

Paul, at this darts in silence to the decanter and, filling a glass, hands it to 
Blanche. While he is in the act of doing so enter Mrs. Doubleday from 
the hall, perceiving with visible horror what b taking place. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, with loud abruptness. 

Paul ! 

PAUL, with a startled jump, letting his wine-glass fall. 

Mamma ? 



MRS. DOUBLEDAY, to herself, coming down. 

Drinking — with a woman ! 

MR. BONSOR, to Mrs. Doubledav. 

My niece has arrived from Germany. (To Blanche.) My 
amiable friend Mrs. Doubleday. (Mrs. doubleday, without 

shaking hands, greets Blanche with a distant and majestic curtsey.) 

BLANCHE, after returning her salutation very much in the same way, to 
Pitt Brunt, who, having seized from the agitated Paul the decanter and 
another glass, approaches her obsequiously. 

Amiable ? I don't believe it ! 

PITT BRUNT, pouring out wine. 

An exemplary woman. 

BLANCHE. 

I detest exemplary women ! 

PITT BRUNT, reprehensive. 

Oh, Miss Amber ! 

BLANCHE. 

And also exemplary men ! 



ACT FIRST 225 

PITT BRUNT. 
You are paradoxical ! Let me give you a glass of wine ! 

BLANCHE. 

Thank you — iVe changed my mind. (Seeing that PAu^ after 

his accident with the wine-glass, has poured out a cup of tea.) But 1 11 

have a cup of tea. 

Paul, taking the invitation, darts to her with the cup. Enter at the same 
instant from the hall Captain Chanter. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Paul! 

PAUL, startled, jumping as before, and all but letting the cup drop. 

Mamma ? 

CHANTER, rushing forward and catching the cup. 

Saved ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, seated down on the left. 
Then bring it to me I (Chanter brings her the tea.) 

MR. BONSOR, mtroducing. 

Captain Chanter — Miss Amber ! 

BLANCHE, after nodding gaily at Chanter, who has bowed to her. 

I seem dangerous to the glass and china ! 

CHANTER, gallant, with his hand on his heart. 

Not only, I take it, to such fragile objects ! 

VOL. II Q 



226 THE REPROBATE 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Captain ! 

CuANTBK Teeis round and talks to her. Pitt Bkunt meantiine has gqoe back 
to the tea&gt;table and exchanged his decanter and glass for a cup of tea, with 
which he returns to Blanche. Mr. Bonsor, going up, has poured out a 
cup of tea and administered it, as it were, to Paul, who stands helpless 
and ruefuL 

PITT BRUNT, with the cup, to Blanche. 

Let pt€ serve you. 

BLANCHE. 

Don't think me very capricious if I change my mind 
again. (To Mr. Bonsor.) I think what I really and truly 
want is to go to my room. 

MR. BONSOR. 

Let me instantly conduct you. 

PITT BRUNT, to Blanche. 

Let m€ wait for you here. 

MR. BONSOR, to Pitt Brunt. 

You're to stay to dinner, you know. 

PITT BRUNT. 

I've brought my things. 

MR. BONSOR. 

Cubit will show you where to dress. 

PITT BRUNT, at the door to the hall to Blanche, whose back is turned. 

Auf Wiedersehen ! 

Exit Pitt Brunt. 



ACT FIRST 227 

MR. BONSOR, to Mrs. Doubleday. 

Shall I find you hexe in ten minutes ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. appealing to Captain Chantbs. 

In ten minutes ? 

CHANTER, looking at his watch and smiling ; to Mr. Bonsor. 

Say a quarter of an hour ! 

MR. BONSOR. 

A quarter of an hour. (He opens the lower door on the right for 
Blanche, who, during the appeal to Mrs. Doubleday, has passed round and 
paused an instant before Paul, whom she looks at sympathetically and a trifle 
strangely ; a movement, a passage between them, observed by Mrs. Doubleday.) 

BLANCHE, at the door, to Mrs. Doubleday, smiling. 

Excuse me ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 
Don't mention it ! (Exeunt Blanche and Mr. Bonsor.) Paul ! 

PAUL, who has his eyes fixed musingly on the door ; startled. 

Yes, Mamma ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Go to your room. 

PAUL. 

Mayn't I come down to dinner ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, after consideration. 

On the understanding that you sit by me, 

CHANTER, protesting tenderly. 

Then, dear lady, whom shall / sit by ? 



228 THE REPROBATE 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, privately, warning. 

Hush — before him ! (To Paul.) Go ! 

PAUL. 

Yes, mamma. 

Exit Paul, submissive, to the hall. 
MRS. DOUBLEDAY, looking on the table. 

Where in the world's my embroidery ? 

CHANTER, helping her to look. 

Your embroidery ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

It was here — it's gone. 

CHANTER, gallant. 

If I had seen it I should doubtless have purloined it — 
treasure-trove ! But I really haven't seen it 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. glancing about. 

I should prefer you to see it. 

CHANTER, pleading. 

Not just now, you know — I want aU your attention. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

You've had it these three hours. 

CHANTER. 

Three hours were not enough — for all I had to say ! 



ACT FIRST 229 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Yet you spoke with eloquence. 

CHANTER. 

Say indeed with passion — with all the ardour of a 
sentiment long repressed, bursting forth in a flood ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

And I followed you with natural embarrassment. 

CHANTER. 

With nothing more natural than embarrassment ? With 
no indulgence for my faults, with no encouragement for 
my hopes ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

I must consider — I must consult. 

CHANTER. 

Consult with me I It's just for that I offer myself! 
Didn't you tell me, moreover, that you would answer 
me in this place ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

IVe immense responsibilities. 

CHANTER. 

It's for the way you discharge them that I revere you. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

They've quite worn me out. What's left is — what you 
see. 



230 THE REPROBATE 

CHANTER. 
What I see is the most charming creature in England — 
a woman the picture of whose rich maturity is but the 
voluminous record of her extraordinary virtue. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

I believe I've done my duty — but the burden has been 
heavy indeed. 

CHANTER. 

Let me take it on my shoulders ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Wait till you know what it has been in the past, to 
judge what it may be in the future. 

CHANTER, smiling. 

In the future we shall be two. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Say, alas, we shall be three ! 

CHANTER. 

Oh, if you count that way we shall be four. We 
mustn't forget dear Bonsor. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Never — he has been everything to me. 

CHANTER, dubious. 

Everything ? 



ACT FIRST 231 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

In my interminable martyrdom. 

CHANTER. 

Hell always be at his post. There's no fear of his ever " 
marrying ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

There never was. He's impervious to female charms. 

CHANTER, smiling. 

That makes one more comfortable. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Oh, I haven't thought of conquest — I've thought only 
of my daily round. Mr. Bonsor will* accuse me of 
deserting him. 

CHANTER, argumentative, cogent. 

You reinforce him ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

I certainly shouldn't look at you unless I thought you 
were good. 

CHANTER, self-complacent. 

I do try to be good. The best of us can only try. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

And not all who try succeed. You do. 

CHANTER, simpering. 

Very kind of you to have noticed it. 



232 THE REPROBATE ; 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

That's why I shrink from telling you everything. 

CHANTER. 

To the pure all things are pure ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

So I've had often to say to myself — in the atmosphere 
of Paul's propensities. 

CHANTER. 

It has left you unspotted. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. anxious. 

Will it leave you so ? That's the question that haunts 
me now. 

CHANTER. 

Just try me and see ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

You know, then, in a general way, the task I accepted 
on the lamented death of Mr. Doubleday. 

CHANTER. 

To watch over the product of his earlier union. You 
may be said to have watched. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 
Night and day — it was a sacred trust. His earlier union 
had been a blunder. 



ACT FIRST 233 

CHANTER. 



He didn't know you. 



MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

He couldn't. I was scarcely born. 

CHANTER. 

If you had been you'd have been saved — 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

This crashing legacy? It's not improbable. But I 
came too late. 

CHANTER. 

Not too late to save Paul. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Have I saved him ? That remains to be seen ! His 
mother, alas, was — indelicate ! 

CHANTER. 

There are such women ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

She was a person of some appearance; but she was bold. 

CHANTER. 

Yet not unattractive 1 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

There were persons who thought so ; but don't ask for 
details. 



234 THE REPROBATE 

CHANTER. 
I know you well enough to know it would be useless. 
But even without them I can judge of the blood that 
flows in PauFs veins. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Heredity, heredity ! My husband's favourite expression. 
He saw it bear dreadful fruit. 

CHANTER. 

From the child's earliest years ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Almost in the cradle. * Fortunately he was on the look- 
out. 

CHANTER, impulsive. 

Poor old chap ! (Then prompt.) I mean Paul ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

It's indeed his misfortune even more than his fault. 
But it was to the advantage of every one when the fatal 
fountain of such dangers at last ceased to flow. My 
predecessor succumbed — to the last penalties of im- 
propriety; and Mr. Doubleday, after a considerable 
interval, did what he could to repair his original error. 

CHANTER. 

He married a faultless being. 



ACT FIRST 235 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

That's what he was so good as to pronounce me. Un- 
happily his compensation was not so complete as I could 
have wished. I presented him with a second son, who, 
alas, didn't live. . 

CHANTER. 

If he had, he too would have been faultless. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Heredity again ! It was then that we looked in the 
face — that we sadly but heroically accepted — our re- 
sponsibilities to our little incumbrance: not with the 
vain hope of making him what his brother would have 
been, but with that of repressing his inchnations. 

CHANTER. 

And in some degree you succeeded ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Till his twentieth year. Then they burst forth. 

CHANTER, pressing. 

What did he do ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, hesitating, scrupulous. 

Can I safely tell you ? 

CHANTER. 

To the pure all things are pure ! 



236 THE REPROBATE 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Suppose I should communicate a taint ? 

CHANTER. 

I must get accustomed to my danger. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

One does. Paul disappeared. 

CHANTER. 

How did he manage it ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

By the assistance of another person. 

CHANTER 

What description of person ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

The lowest description. A singer, from the "Waterloo." 

CHANTER. 

The Waterloo? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

The name of a popular music-hall. You don't know 
such things — but IVe had to learn them ! Ifer name 
was Nina. 

CHANTER, startled. 

Nina ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Did you ever see her ? 



ACT FIRST 237 

CHANTER. 
Dear me, no ! (To himself.) Nina ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

They went to Paris. 

CHANTER, impulsive, inadvertent. 

That's the best place ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, surprised. 

What do you know about it ? 

CHANTER, on his guard. 

One can't help hearing. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

/ can't, but you should ! We pursued him, we had a 
hunt! and, after unspeakable anxieties and incredible 
efforts, we finally ran him to earth. 

CHANTER with increasing interest. 

Where was he ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

In sumptuous apartments — steeped to the lips in vice. 
He had given the rein to his passions. 

CHANTER, breathless. 

All of them ? 



238 THE REPROBATE 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Without exception. He had changed his name, he had 
waxed his moustache, he had overdrawn his account. 

CHANTER. 

Then you arrived just in time. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

To take him home. We took him. 

CHANTER. 

Did he kick? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

He was prostrate, he couldn't deny it. 

CHANTER. 

No, poor fellow, he does own up ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Our only mercy. He sees himself as he is. Well he 
may, when he killed his father. 

CHANTER, startled. 

Do you really mean — ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

I mean that my husband died of the scandal. But in 
his last hours he cut me out my work. 

CHANTER. 

To keep hold of Paul ? 



ACT FIRST 239 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

To prevent a recurrence. 

CHANTER. 

And youVe prevented it ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

With the help of Mr. Bonsor, whom, as my husband's 
oldest and dearest friend, he appointed, as it were, my 
joint-supervisor. A childless widow with an ample pro- 
vision, I had command of my time, and an equally child- 
less bachelor with an equally adequate fortune, Mr. 
Bonsor had command of his. WeVe given it all to our 
work, we've had no other life. 

CHANTER. 

It's time to have another now. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Sometimes — when I falter — I think so. 

CHANTER. 

You've done so much. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

We've reduced it to a science. To act on the slightest 
symptom. 

CHANTER. 

To cry " Fire ! " on the first puff of smoke ! 



240 THE REPROBATE 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

If we SO much as sniff it, we turn on the hose. We 
flood the whole place. 

CHANTER. 

So that Paul lives, as it were, under water. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

It has taught him to swim, it has made him amphibious. 
We organise his hours; we regulate his thoughts; we 
control his imagination. We're intensely particular, for 
instance, about his reading. Nothing that treats of the 
passions. 

CHANTER. 

That cuts it down ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

We cut it down. We cut everything down. We allow 
him no pocket-money. 

CHANTER: 

None at all ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Sixpence a day. 

CHANTER. 

You can't be very bad on that ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

You can be very good ! He gives it to the poor. We 
allow him no tobacco, no wine, and no female ac- 
quaintance. 



ACT FIRST 241 

CHANTER. 
What then do you allow him ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Nothing. To such a nature everything's an opportunity. 
He reports himself at fixed hours, and, as you know, I 
rarely leave his side. 

CHANTER. 

Yes, I had a job to get you off. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

I locked him up. 

CHANTER. 

But he got out. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Mr. Bonsor must have taken the responsibility. Four 
times a year we spend a month here — for Mr. Bonsor to 
do his part 

CHANTER. 

He seems to do it very well. 

MRS. POUBLEDAY, dubious. 

Mr. Bonsor requires to be kept up. He shouldn't have 
invited that girl. 

CHANTER. 

Oh, 111 look after i^dr/ 

VOL. II R 



242 THE REPROBATE 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Don^t take the trouble, Fll look after her ! Now you 
see my life. 

CHANTER. 

To see it is to admire it ; but there's one thing I don't 
understand 1 Paul's healthy, hearty, independent — 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

He's still an infant. 

CHANTER. 
An infant of thirty ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

By the terms of his father's will. He doesn't come of 
age till he's forty ; unless before that, in the exercise of 
our discretion, if it seems to us finally safe, we anticipate 
a little, we put him in possession. 

CHANTER. 

He could break such a will in an hour ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

It would never occur to him — he takes our view. 

CHANTER. 
Very obliging of him ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

I do him justice — he repents. He's afraid of his 
passions. 



ACT FIRST 243 

CHANTER, as if with the deliberate resolve to face, courageously, consider- 
able exposure. 

Well, I ain't ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, anxious, ominous. 

Are you sure they're riot contagious ? 

CHANTER. 

I'll set him the example of mine. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 
Yours ? 

CHANTER. 

I've only one — it's for you ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

You're almost irresistible — but think it well over! 
(Seeing Mr. bonsor.) Here's Mr. Bonsor, for one of our 
regular councils, which we never postpone. (Re-enter Mr. 

Bonsor from the lower door on the right. Waving Captain Chanter toward 

the Ubrary.) Think it over and over ! 

CHANTER, at the door of the library. 

Coquette ! 

Exit Captain Chanter. 
MR. BONSOR. 

On what are you inviting him so peculiarly to brood ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

My peculiar position. 



244 THE REPROBATE 

MR. BONSOR. 
What has he got to do with it ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. modest. 

That he must confide to you himself. 

MR. BONSOR. 

Mrs. Doubleday, you've a bad conscience ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, with spirit. 

Not worse than you ought to have ! 

MR. BONSOR. 

I'm not straying into languid by-paths — I'm not thinking 
of a sacrifice to Hymen. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Of marriage ? You think of nothing else but that girl's ! 

MR. BONSOR. 

Well, if Tm a victim of duty, I'm also Blanche's uncle. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

And if rm a victim of duty, I'm also — (Checking herself 

as if from delicacy.) 

MR. BONSOR. 

Not the Captain's aunt — though you might be ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

There's something you might be, Mr. Bonsor: a little 
more correct in your figures ! 



ACT FIRST 245 

mr: BONSOR. 
This is not a time to recriminate — it's a time for har- 
monious action. (Taking the photograph fiom hb pocket) Look 

at that ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, with the photograph. 

Paul! 

MR. BONSOR. 

Dudley ! 

. MRS. DOUBLEDAY, looking at the back. 

Nina ! 

MR. BONSOR. 

She's here ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, horrified. 

Here? 

MR. BONSOR. 

Come back for him ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

After all these years ? 

MR. BONSOR. 

They've been wasted ! She was here an hour ago — she 
may return at any moment. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Prevent her — head her off! 

MR. BONSOR. 

Shall I see her alone ? 



246 THE REPROBATE 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. dabious. 

No, that won't do ! FU see her ! 

MR. BONSOR. 

Such a person ? It's indecorous. Fll see her ! 

Exit Bfr. BoMSOS rapidly to the hall. 
MRS. DOUBLEDAY, with the photograph in her hand. 

He's too proper by half; he needn't accuse me! 

CTceati the photograph on the table and goes qoiddy to the door of the library, 
where she calls.) Captain ! (Then as Chantkr reappears: re-enter 

Captain Chantsr.) She's come back ! 

CHANTER. 

Who's come back ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Nina! 

CHANTER, bounding in. 

Nina? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

We must double the guard ! 

CHANTER, to himself, excited, alarmed. 

Heavens ! if it's my Nina ? (To Mrs. doubleday.) Where 
is she ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Mr. Bonsor's gone to look. 

CHANTER, nervous, starting to go up. 

17/ go to look ! 



ACT FIRST 247 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, commanding. 
Captain ! (As Chanter comes down again.) You'll Stay here. 
(Indicating the table.) Thcrc's his photOgraph. 

CHANTER, taking the photograph. 
And where's hers ? (Tosses the photograph back.) 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, struck. 

Why should you want it ? 

CHANTER, rueful. 

True — when we have the reality ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

I'll turn the key in Paul's door ! 

CHANTER, looking at his watch. 

You must dress for dinner. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 
His room is next to mine. (Then with sudden seductiveness.) 

Now do you want me ? 

CHANTER, ardent. 

More than ever, beloved ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, giving himlier hand to kiss. 

Then take me ! 

Chanter seizes it and kisses it with an air of rapture, on which Mrs. Double- 
day, snatches it away and goes out hastily to the hall. Re-enter Cubit by 
the lower door on the right. 



248 THE REPROBATE 

CUBIT. 

I've put out the embroidered waistcoat, sir. 

CHANTER, to himseU; agitated. 

Embroidered by Nina's hand ! 

Exit Captain Chantxs by the lower door od the right. 
CUBIT, alone. 

Does he know she was here ? has he seen what she left ? 
Where is that elegant object ? (Seeing blanchx ambbk at the 

window.) Her^S an elegant object ! (Renter Blanche, dressed 

for dinner, from the lawn.) Quite comfortaUe in your room, 
Miss? 

BLANCHE. 

Perfectly, thank you ! 

CUBIT, looking at his watch. 

Dinner in ten minutes. 

BLANCHE. 

I'm quite ready. (Exit Cubit to the haiL) What sociable 
servants ! (At the table on the left.) But what dreary books ! 

(Taking up one.) The Experience of Life} (Turning it over.) 

Improving ! (Flinging it down.) I hate improvement ! The 

usual photographs ? (Takmg up the photograph of Paul.) Ah, 

no, not quite ! Poor Mr. Paul — in all his impropriety ! 

What a history ! He is handsome ! (Turning over the photo- 
graph.) But why "Dudley"? Some wild pet name! 
How romantic ! And who's " Nina " ? (Musing while she 
looks again at Paul's image.) Some great lady, perhaps, whose 
head he has turned — her pet name ! Is she handsome ? 



ACT FIRST 249 

(With h«r eyes for a moment on the picture.) I hopC DOt ! (Seeing 
Paul, who has appeared at the window, she is so startled that, as he comes in 
and down, she slips the photograph, to prevent his seeing it, precipitately, in- 
stinctively into her pocket. Enter Paul Doublbdav from the lawn ; shyly, 
hesitatingly, tentatively, as if his pretext has suddenly failed him. He is not 
dressed for dinner. He comes doMm, however, with a visible mixture of impetu- 
osity and caution, which gives him an odd air that makes Blanchb appear to 
wonder, with sudden amusement, what is the matter with him.) Ar6 yOU 

looking for anything ? 

PAUL, panting a little. 

No, thank you ! — I mean 1 am/ 

BLANCHE. 

Anything that was on that table ? 

, PAUL, looking vaguely and as if a little surprised. 
Nothing that was on that table. (Seeing Tke Experience of Life.) 

Not that book — I mayn't touch it 

BLANCHE. 

The Experience of Life ? Don't — it's dreadfully slow ! 

PAUL, surprised. 

It's too fast for me ! Have you any books ? 

BLANCHE, thinking. 

Any books ? 

PAUL. 

Any safe ones. They're all impossible here. 

BLANCHE. 

Impossibly dull ? 



2SO THE REPROBATE 

PAUL. 
Impossibly lively ! They excite a train of thought. 

BLANCHE. 

In this good house — ^my uncle's ? 

PAUL. 

I mean for me. But I'm not like others — I'm so easily 
upset ! 

BLANCHE, looking at him an instant with compassitMiate assent and interest. 

Ah, yes — I know ! 

PAUL, struck- 

You know already ? 

BLANCHE. 

My uncle has mentioned it. 

PAUL, with a sigh of resignation. 

Yes, he always mentions it ! 

BLANCHE. 

And Mr. Pitt Brunt had hinted — 

PAUL, with a flash of spirit. 

Mr. Pitt Brunt ? I'd thank him not to hint ! 

BLANCHE. 

He spoke of it kindly — he's sorry for you. IVe* a 
charming book upstairs — a railway novel. 



ACT FIRST 251 

PAUL, with a sigh of renunciation. 

Ah, railway novels won't do ! Quite forbidden ! 

BLANCHE, with the same compassion. 

They do keep you short ! 

PAUL, making every concession. 

They have to, you see. (After an instant.) My propensities, 
you know. 

BLANCHE, grave, impressed. 

Are they so awfully marked ? 

PAUL. 

With big black numbers— one, two, three ! 

BLANCHE, wondering 

Three ? 

PAUL. 

Oh, there are more than that! But don^t ask me to 
count. 

BLANCHE. 
Not for the world. (Then after an instant, smiling.) Fll COUUt ! 

PAUL. 

As you see them appear ? You'll get tired ! 

BLANCHE. 

They don't appear — it seems to me — in your appear- 
ance ! 



252 THE REPROBATE 

PAUL. 
Ah, the very worst of them is my duplicity ! But if you 
know I'm not naturally good, you must also know that I 
at least struggle to be. 

BLANCHE. 

Why, I do that myself! 

PAUL. 

Yes, but you don't fall. I invariably do. I did just 
now, at my window. 

BLANCHE, Uughiog. 

You don't mean you fell out of it ! 

PAUL. 

That would have hurt me less. No. I looked at you — 
I looked at you in the garden. 

BLANCHE. 
Oh yes, I went down there — I had finished dressing. 

PAUL. 

/hadn't — but I unblushingly gazed at you. 

BLANCHE 

I didn't see you — I was admiring the garden. It's very 
lovely. 

PAUL, explosive. 

Never so lovely as with you in it ! 



Oh, Mr. Doubleday 



ACT FIRST 253 

BLANCHE. 

! 



PAUL. 

See how bad I am ! After I had stared a few moments 
I came straight down — I followed you in here. 

BLANCHE. 

But how does that " hurt " you ? 

PAUL. 

It excites a train of thought. 

BLANCHE, laughing. 

Like the railway novels ? Thank you ! 

PAUL. 

Mr. Bonsor gave me a tremendous caution. 

BLANCHE. 

So he did me ! 

PAUL. 

And I gave him a tremendous pledge. 

BLANCHE. 

Well, I didn^t ! 

PAUL. 

Oh, you're free — because you're good ! 

BLANCHE. 

It's better to have passions and control them. 



254 THE REPROBATE 

PAUL. 
That's just what I didn't do — ^when I came down here ! 

BLANCHE, after an instant. 

Was it a passion that brought you ? 

PAUL. 

I don't know what to call it. Miss Amber. It was an 
emotion not to be controlled ! See, I'm getting worse ! 



BLANCHE. I 

You must pull up — you must recover yourself ! 

PAUL. 

I shall try to do so presently ; but, before I begin, let 
me say this one thing, which was really, I think, the 
idea that made me break my vow ! I want you to 
understand my reserve. 

BLANCHE, smiling. 

I don't see your reserve, Mr. Doubleday ! 

PAUL, quickly, reassuring. 

You will in a moment ! Then please remember this, 
that if I don't speak to you it's because I'm forbidden, 
and if I don't look at you, it's because I'm afraid. 

BLANCHE. 

What are you afraid of? 

PAUL. 

I'm afraid of myself 1 



ACT FIRST 255 

BLANCHE, impressed, taking it very seriously. 

You live, then, in such terror? 

PAUL. 

Not quite in terror, perhaps, but in very grave anxiety. 
I never know what I may do next ! 

BLANCHE, smiling. 

You frighten me a little ! 

PAUL. 

Oh, now that IVe explained, I shall again put on the 
mask ! 

BLANCHE, sighing. 

The tragic mask ! 

PAUL. 

Not even that : the expressionless ! 

BLANCHE. 

Well, if you mayn't express, / may ! 

PAUL, a little ironic. 

Mustn't you first ask Pitt Brunt ? 

BLANCHE. 

Never ! He has no passions. 

PAUL. 

Yes, he has an easy life of it. 



256 THE REPROBATE 

BLANCHE. 

He talked to me just now about the Bill of 'S6, I 
attach no importance to the Bill of '86 ! 

PAUL, vacue. 

You think it didn't go far enough ? 

BLANCHE. 

Mr. Brunt says it went too far ! 

PAUL. 

He always thinks everything Moes. That is doubtless 
the danger ! 

BLANCHE, sympathetic. 

It's the danger that makes the hero ! 

PAUL. 

Oh, rm not a hero ! I'm too often beaten ! 

BLANCHE, with pity and curiosity. 

The enemy's so strong ? 

PAUL 

Overwhelming, Miss Amber ! 

BLANCHE. 
It makes your problem wonderfully interesting — your 
situation intensely dramatic. I should like immensely 
to help you ! 

PAUL. 

How can you ? 



ACT FIRST 257 

BLANCHE. 
By fighting at your side. 

PAUL. 

In the thick of the fray ? You'd be scandalised ! 

BLANCHE. 

Ah, not so easily ! I can understand temptation — I 
can allow for it 1 

PAUL. 

What do you know about it ? 

BLANCHE, after an instant, quite exalted. 

IVe felt it ! 

PAUL. 

But always resisted ! 

BLANCHE, after another hesitation, in the same way. 

Not always ! 

PAUL, with vehemence. 

Ah, don't undermine me ! 

BLANCHE. 

Not for the world — ^but I must look the enemy in the 

face ! (Seeing Pitt Brunt.) SilcnCC ! 

Re-enter Pitt Brunt from the hall and stands looking an instant from 
Blanche to Paul. 

PITT BRUNT, to Paul. 

You're not dressed for dinner ? (As if with the habit of setting a 

superior example.^ I am ! 

VOL. 11 S 



25« THE REPROBATE 

PAUL. 
Oh, yoiire good ! But HI dress now. 

Exit Paui. to the haU. 
BLANCHE, with slight irony, to Pitt Bsumt. 

Yes — ^you're faultless ! 

PITT BRUNT, much gratified. 

Delighted to hear it from you^ Miss Amber ! 

BLANCHE. 

You wouldn't be if you knew (Pauses, as she turns away, with 

a vague shrug.) 

PITT BRUNT. 

If I knew what ? 

BLANCHE. 

That I can enter into — every aberration ! 

PITT BRUNT, shocked. 

Every one ? 

BLANCHE, reconsidering. 

Well, most ! (Pointing at the door on the left.) What's in there ? 

PITT BRUNT. 

The library. 

BLANCHE. 

I'll look at the books. 

PITT BRUNT. 

They're perfectly unobjectionable. 



ACT FIRST 259 

BLANCHE. 
So much the worse ! 

Exit Blanche to the library. 
PITT BRUNT. 

Awfully paradoxical, but awfully charming ! 

Re-enter, from the hall, Mrs. Frbshville accompanied by Cubit. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. to Cubit. 

Don't announce me go away ! (Cubit bows obsequiously and 

exit to the hall. To Brunt, familiarly.) Dinner-time, eh? 

PITT BRUNT, surprised. 

Do you dine with us ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

No, but I suppose fu does, doesn't he ? 

PITT BRUNT, freshly mystified. 

Again, madam, I'm in doubt — 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

No matter — / ain't ! 

PITT BRUNT. 

You're very mysterious, but it's attractive ! Whoever the 
gentleman is, he's dressing. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, looking about her for her reticule. 

ril dress him ! Where's my bag ? 



26o THE REPROBATE 

PITT BRUNT. 
Your bag ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

I forgot it here — it contains treasures. Please produce it. 

PITT BRUNT. 

Dear madam, how shall I produce it ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

By finding it. I must have it. Look for it. 

PITT BRUNT, glancing about. 

I am looking ; I don't see it ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Look more. Go and ask the butler. 

PITT BRUNT. 

I usually ring — for a servant. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

/ don't — I pounce. Try pouncing. 

PITT BRUNT, amused. 

I often try it in the House ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Then " go for him *' — there's a dear ! 

PITT BRUNT. 
Oh, if you put it fAaf way — ! 



ACT FIRST 261 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, smiling. 

I'll put it any way you like ! 

PITT BRUNT. 

You're more and more mysterious ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Not when you know me ! 

PITT BRUNT, after an instant. 

I should be glad to make time to know you. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, gay. 

Naughty man ! what would the young lady say ? (Then as 
he protests.) First see about my bag. 

PITT BRUNT, graUfied. 

I'll see about it. 

Exit Pitt Brunt to the hall. 
MRS. FRESHVILLE, alone. 

The member for Blackport ? There's more in him than 
meets the eye ! (Then in another tone.) They assemble here 
for dinner ? Then for my gentleman ! (As she sees Chanter.) 
As large as life — in my old waistcoat ! 



Re-enter Captain Chanter by the lower door on the right ; stopping short, 
transfixed, appalled. 



CHANTER. 
Nina ? Horrors ! (Then with a quaver of dismay as she simply stands 
before him unmistakable and imperturbable.) What doeS this mean ? 



262 THE REPROBATE 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Can't you imagine? 

CHANTER. 

Nothing so awful ! Go away ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Not without youy my duck. I've come for you ! 

CHANTER, more and more alarmed. 

You're mad — ^you're wicked — ^you're indecent ! They'll 
all be here ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Then you can present me ! That's what I've waited for. 

CHANTER. 

You've waited ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

All the afternoon. 

CHANTER. 

And who has seen you ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Only one or two, as yet; but the rest shall have the 
treat. 

CHANTER, scared, helpless, going up to look out and commg down. 

Nina, do you want to crush me ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Yes, to small pieces. And to pick them up and keep 
them. 



ACT FIRST 263 

CHANTER. 

Keep them in a mortuary urn — youVe killing me ! How 
did you get here ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

The same way as you, I suppose. By the aid of my wits. 

CHANTER. 

Your wits are remarkable, but theyVe sadly misled you. 
You've taken a fatal step ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 
Fatal, no doubt (whipping out the roU of tapestry she has appropriated in 

the first scene) to the perpetrator of this ! 

CHANTER. 

Vou took it ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

To convict you. The last link in the chain ! 
CHANTER. 

Give it back to me ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

To give back to /ter? Let her give you back first 

(Then tossing the tapestry away.) FaUgh ! 

CHANTER, distracted. 

They're coming ! Let me meet you somewhere else ! 



264 THE REPROBATE 



MRS. FRESHVILLE, ; 

At the altar, Captain Chanter — to-morrow ! 

CHANTER- 

Make an appointment with me — we'll talk it over ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

We'll talk it over now — it'll save time. 

CHANTER. 

I can't — I'm faint ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

I've no doubt you are ! 

CHANTER. 

For want of food ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Doesn't she give you enough — with the fortune you're 
hunting so hard ? Come with me and you shall have 
plenty ! 

CHANTER. 

There's no such person as you suppose ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Then why are you so afraid she'll see me ? 

CHANTER. 

There are ladies here, but they're innocent — ! 



ACT FIRST 265 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

I don't suspect them all — one will do ! 

CHANTER. 

Who poisoned your mind ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

You, and your flagrant bad faith; your unnatural ab- 
sences and your still more unnatural explanations. So 
I sent for the doctor. 

CHANTER. 

You do run up bills ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

I sent for two or three. They had a consultation and 
found out what was the matter. 

CHANTER. 

I could have told you for nothing ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

They put their finger on the place ! 

CHANTER, blank. 

What place ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

This place ! They followed you ; they tracked you. 

CHANTER. 

Detectives ? (Reproachful, bantering.) Oh, bad Nina ! • 



266 THE REPROBATE 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

They showed me the way ! I took it. 

CHANTER, with his hand ftimbling in his pocket, going up again and coming 
down, irresolute, desperate, on pins and needles. 

Then what'll you take now ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Nothing, thanks : I had something at the inn ! 

CHANTER. 

What can I do for you ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Redeem your solemn vow — make me your wedded wife ! 

CHANl ER, stands for an instant thinking, covering his face with his hands. 

Meet me then — ^to-morrow. Ill come up to town. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 
With the ring in your hand ? 

CHANTER. 

And bells on my toes — all the jewelry you want ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

My wants are limited to a plain gold circle. And you 
needn't come up to town — I shall be here. 

CHANTER. 

If you don't allow me my freedom of action, how can I 
square her? 



ACT FIRST 267 

MRS. FRESH VI LLE. 

Allow me mine. Fll square her ! 

CHANTER. 

Don't you see that if you make a scene — ? (Checks himself, 

listening.) 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Well, if I make a scene ? 

CHANTER. 

Why, I'm nowhere ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Well, / ain't — so it doesn't matter ! But I don't mind 
giving you an hour now — for I flatter myself I've got 
you ! 

CHANTER, frightened, as she is going up. 

Don't go that yf3iy — wait ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 
Wait here? 

CHANTER, still more alarmed. 
No, wait there I (Pushing her to the lower door on the right.) Don't 

come out till we've gone to dinner ! 

Exit Mrs. FRESHVILLE, hustled out ; on which Chanter turns, deeply agitated, 
to meet Mrs. Doubleday. Re-enter Mrs. Doubleday from the hall, dressed 
for dinner. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Where's Mr. Bonsor? 

CHANTER. 

I haven't seen him. 



268 THE REPROBATE 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Still looking for that woman ? 

CHANTER, vague, on his gnanL 

That woman ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Why, Paul's dreadful connection. 

CHANTER. 

Oh yes ! (To himseu:) I wish she u*cre Paul's ! (Thinks an 

instant.) Perhaps she is I (Then breathless with the happy thought.) 

That photograph ! — she must be ! (Exultant.) Saved ! 

Re-enter Mr. Bonsor from the hall, dressed for dinner. 
MRS. DOUBLEDAY, to Mr. Bonsor. 

Did you see her ? 

MR. BONSOR. 

No, I hunted — but I had to dress. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

She'll come back — we'll catch her ! 

CHANTER, nervous. 

Oh, let's have dinner first ! 

MR. BONSOR. 
Where are the young people ? 

CHANTER, impatient, seeing Blanchb. 

Here's one of them — that's enough ! 

Re-enter Blanche Amber from the library. 



ACT FIRST 269 

MR. BONSOR. 
And Where's Pitt Brunt ? 

BLANCHE. 
And Where's Mr. Paul ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, reminded, cUpping her hand to her pocket 

The key's in my other dress — I quietly locked him in. 

BLANCHE, smiling. 

He must have escaped — he was here ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, alarmed. 

Here? 

BLANCHE. 

Ten minutes ago. 

MR. BONSOR, to Mrs. Doubledav, severe. 

You quietly locked him out ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Mercy — where is he then ? 

Re-enter Cubit from the hall. 
CUBIT, to Mr. BoNSOR. 

Dinner, sir. 

CHANTER, pressing, catching Mrs. Doubledav by the arm and hurrying 
her up to the hall. 

It doesn't matter — come ! 

Exeunt Captain Chanter and Mrs. Doubledav, and, hurrying after them, Mr. 
BoNSOR and Blanche. As Cubit is about to follow, re-enter Pitt Brunt 
from the lawn. ' . . •

PITT BRUNT, resentful 

IVe looked for you everywhere. 

CUBIT. 

Doing my 'air, sir. 

PITT BRUNT 

Where's that lady ? 

CUBIT, blank, giving it up. 

Showed herself out I 

PITT BRUNT. 

But Where's her bag ? 

CUBIT. 

No connection with the luggage, sir. 

PITT BRUNT, mystified. 

I give it up ! 

Exit Pitt Brunt to the hall. 
CUBIT, alone, glancing about him. 

Where is the blessed bag ? A liberal reward — (Pauses 

as he sees Mrs. Fresh villb.) 

Re-enter Mrs. Frbshvillb by the lower door on the right. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, giving Cubit, in a business-like way, as soon as she 
sees him, another sovereign with which she has already provided herself. 

Add that ! 



ACT FIRST 271 

CUBIT, with the sovereign. 

Sixpence back, ma'am ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

No — ^keep it ! 

CUBIT. 

For silence, ma'am ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

For anything you like ! 

CUBIT, to himself. 

Thirty-nine and six ! 

Exit Cubit to the hall. Re-enter Paul Doubleday from the garden. 
MRS. FRESHVILLE, before seeing Paul. 

But my reticule — with the dear old photo ? (Then as Paul 
appears.) Gracious powers — the original ! 

PAUL, staring, amazed, coming down. 

Nina?

Dudley !

busily hunting for something, lifting up one object after the other. 
Enter Cubit from the halL 

CUBIT. 
Did you ring, sir ? 

MR. BONSOR. 

Yes, I want a photograph — a photograph of Mr. Paul. 

CUBIT. 

Delighted to have him took, sir. 

MR. BONSOR. 
He has been " took," unfortunately ; and the result, which 
was placed upon this table yesterday, by Mrs. Double- 
day, has been surreptitiously removed. 

CUBIT. 

Never put my hand to anything, sir. 

MR. BONSOR. 
I wish you'd put your head ! I want Captain Chanter. 



ACT SECOND 273 

CUBIT. 
His photograph, sir? 

MR. BONSOR. 

His presence. 

CUBIT. 

Here it is, sir. 

Enter Captain Chanter from the haU ; to which exit Cubit. 
MR. BONSOR, opening drawers, to Chanter. 

Did you appropriate that photograph — the one Mrs. 
Doubleday showed you ? 

CHANTER, embarrassed. 

Oh, the picture of Paul ? 

MR. BONSOR. 

The picture of Dudley ! It has irrecoverably vanished. 

CHANTER. 

I put it back on the table. (To himself.) Nina recovered 
it? 

MR. BONSOR. 
Then who can have taken it ? 

CHANTER, thinking. 

Dudley ! 

MR. BONSOR. 

The record of his shame ? 

VOL. II ' T 



274 THE REPROBATE 

CHANTER, prompt. 

To cancel his shame. 

MR. BONSOR, severe. 

There must be no cancelling ! 

CHANTER. 

To annihilate the proof. 

• MR. BONSOR. 

There must be no annihilation. We'll get it back. 

CHANTER. 

ril get it back ! Perhaps youVe already heard from 
Mrs. Doubleday that IVe accepted onerous functions. 

MR. BONSOR. 

It was precisely on the subject of those functions that I 
desired to converse with you. Mrs. Doubleday has 
imparted to me her project of a second union. 

CHANTER. 

I hope you don't regard it as a defection. It doubles 
the guard ! 

MR. BONSOR, with dignity. 

The guard has hitherto been adequate. 

CHANTER. 

How can you say so in the face of our present alarm ? 



ACT SECOND 275 

MR. BONSOR, still with dignity. 

It's very good of you to share it ! 

CHANTER. 

I feel strongly that you require relief. 

MR. BONSOR, virtuous. 

IVe never asked for it I 

CHANTER. 

You're a Stoic — you're a hero ! But remember that 
Mrs. Doubleday's essentially a woman. 

MR. BONSOR. 

It's just what I've endeavoured to forget ! 

CHANTER. 

Such endeavours are vain — I never make them. 
(Looking at his watch.) Mrs. Doubleday's late — I'm waiting. 

MR. BONSOR. 

What are you waiting for ? 

CHANTER. 

To take Paul over. 

MR. BONSOR, blank. 

Over where ? 

CHANTER. 

To receive him from her hands. She commits him to 
me — ceremonially. 



276 THE REPROBATE 

MR. BONSOR. 
They're preparing, then, for the ceremony. 

CHANTER, grave. 

I've been preparing too. 

MR. BONSOR. 

In what manner ? 

CHANTER. 

By meditation. We hope youll assist at it. 

MR. BONSOR 

I'll not refuse to show you that I appreciate your 
singular zeal. The more so that it's manifested in a 
critical hour. 

CHANTER. 

It was just the crisis that appealed to me ! 

MR. BONSOR. 

Are you ready to meet it ? 

CHANTER. 

With your inspiring confidence ! 

MR. BONSOR, after an instant. 
You have it ! (They shake hands solemnly ; then Mr. Bonsor looks at 

his watch.) She must be decking him for the solemn rite. 

CHANTER. 

With ribbons and garlands ? 



ACT SECOND 277 

MR. BONSOR. 
With sackcloth and ashes. 

CHANTER, impatient. 

I want to get at him ! 

MR. BONSOR. 

It's my individual conviction that he has been got at ! 

CHANTER. 

You allude to last evening ? 

MR. BONSOR. 

While we were at dinner. Just after the member for 
Blackport had taken his place among us, we were 
startled by the sound of a remarkable concussion. It 
seemed to proceed from the drawing-room. 

CHANTER. 

Which we all invaded — to find it didn't. 

MR. BONSOR. 

All except Blanche. One of the parties to the encounter 
had already vanished, but Paul was on the spot 

CHANTER. 

Declaring — ^when examined — that he hadn't laid eyes 
on any one. 

MR. BONSOR. 

It's the first time, remarkable to say, that he has ever 
told an untruth. 



278 THE REPROBATE 

CHANTER. 
Are you sure it ts an untruth ? 

MR. BONSOR. 

He was pale, agitated, unnatural. 

CHANTER. 

He didn't wish to compromise the lady ! 

MR. BONSOR. 

Hadn't she compromised him ? 

CHANTER. 

He has* no character to lose. But the question shall 
be probed to the bottom. 

MR BONSOR. 

Please probe it ! 

Re-enter Cubit from the hall. 
CUBIT, announcing. 

Mr. Pitt Brunt ! 

Enter Pitt Brunt from the hall. 
MR. BONSOR. 

Have you brought your luggage ? 

PITT BRUNT. 

It consists mainly of my quotations — twenty volumes 
of Hansard. 



ACT SECOND 279 

CHANTER. 

Your quotations must be singularly copious ! 

MR. BONSOR, to Chanter. 

He will contribute to those of posterity. (To Cubit.) 
Arrange the twenty volumes. 

PITT BRUNT, to Cubit. 

Chronologically ! 

Exit Cubit to the hall. 
MR. BONSOR, to Chanter. 

The member for Blackport is to meet his electors. 

PITT BRUNT. 

I'm writing my speech — and trying it on Mr. Bonsor. 
CHANTER. 

I hope itil be a comfortable fit. Ill not interfere with 
the process. 

Exit Captain Chanter by the lower door on the right. 
MR. BONSOR, to Brunt. 

It will save time to have you in the house. And then 
there's another reason. 

PITT BRUNT, as Blanche appears. 
Here's the other reason ! (Enter Blanche Amber from the hall 
with a railway novel in her hand.) Good moming. I've COme tO 

Stay ! 



28o THE REPROBATE 

BLANCHE. 
I'm very happy, this morning, to feel that that's just 
what I've done ! 

PITT BRUNT. 
Isn't it a remarkably interesting house ? 

BLANCHE. 

Fascinating ! (Mr. Bonsok and Pitt Bruht look at each other, and 
Rlanchs conadcn a moment the cover of her railway noveL Then she speaks 

ahmptiy.) Dear uncle ! (Holding out her hook.) Is that im- 
proper ? 

MR. BONSOR, with the hook, looking at the cover with his glasses. 

A lady and gentleman, engaged-^ 

BLANCHE. 

Oh, they're not engaged ! 

PITT BRUNT, interested. 

What are they doing ? 

MR. BONSOR. 

Embracing ! (DuWous, disapproving, while he still looks,) If they're 
not engaged — 

PITT BRUNT. 

They ought to be ! (To blanche.) Every one who isn't 
ought to be. 

BLANCHE. 

From a sense of duty ? Tm afraid I've no conscience. 
(To Mr. BoNsoR.) May I lend that book to Mr. Paul ? 



ACT SECOND 281 

MR. BONSOR, looking at her severely over his glasses. 

The question exemplifies your deficiency ! 

^ PITT BRUNT. 

You may lend it to me, 

BLANCHE, taking the book back. 

You wouldn't understand it ! 

MR. BONSOR. 

YouVe got your Hansard. 

Re-enter Cubit from the hall. 
CUBIT, to Brunt. 

I think IVe set them straight, sir. 

MR. BONSOR. 

Chronologically ? 

CUBIT, blank an instant. 

No, sir, on their sides. 

MR. BONSOR, to Brunt. 

Go and see. 

PITT BRUNT, smiling to Blanche. 

I must make them sit up ! 

Exit Pitt Brunt to the hall. Exit Cubit. 
MR. BONSOR. 

He makes the House ! 

BLANCHE, tossing down her book. 

Isn't he supposed to know anything f 



282 THE REPROBATE 

MR. BONSOR, who has taken up the book. 

The member for Blackport ? 

BLANCHE. 

The prisoner of Chillon ! 

MR. BONSOR. 

He's supposed to know too much ! The harm's done, 
but we endeavour to prevent its spreading. (He goes to the 

cabinet on the right, opens it and, seeing Mrs. Frbshvillb's reticule, which he 
has put away there, considers an instant, and then, as if with a hsq&gt;py thought, 
plumps the booklnto it. To himself.) JuSt do for her / 

BLANCHE, who has not seen this proceeding ; musing, objecting. 

He seems after all to do nothing ! 

MR. BONSOR. triumphant. 

What did he do last night ? 

BLANCHE. 
I haven't the least idea. (Then after an instant.) But I 

should like to help you ! 

MR. BONSOR, suspicious. 

Everyone would like to " help " me ! 

BLANCHE. 

You must double the guard ! 

MR. BONSOR. 
That's what they all say ! 



ACT SECOND 2S3 

BLANCHE. 
It shows there's something in it ! 

MR. BONSOR. 
There may be something in it, but it's not what I sent 
for you for. 

BLANCHE, turning away with a groan. 

Ah, dear uncle, I know what you sent for me for ! 

MR. BONSOR. 

The member for Blackport's the Idol of the North ! 

BLANCHE. 

The idol should remain in his temple. 

MR. BONSOR, indignant. 

What would the House do without him ? 

BLANCHE. 

Perhaps it would wake up ! 

\ 

MR. BONSOR. 

The House is his temple 1 He's the young man of the 
hour. 

BLANCHE. 

Do you mean of the dinner-hour ? 

MR. BONSOR. 

There's not a question of the day that he has not made 
his own.

Well, dear uncle, as Fm not the question of the day — 

MR. BONSOR. 

You would none the less have your appointed place. 
His private life would be worthy of his public 

BLANCHE. 

But should / be worthy of his private ? 

MR. BONSOR. 

Let him read you his momentous speech. 

BLANCHE. 

Is it very long? 

MR. BONSOR. 

Not yet ; but it will be. It's growing fast. 

BLANCHE, smiling. 

Then I'll take it when it's little, (in another tone.) But, all 
the same, I'm interested in Mr. Paui&gt; 

MR. BONSOR, disconcerted. 

"Interested"? 

BLANCHE. 

I regard him as an object of charity. 

MR. BONSOR. 

Why so ? His wants are provided for ! 



ACT SECOND 285 

BLANCHE. 
There are wants and wants. Why not let him have — 

MR. BONSOR, as she pauses, thinking. 

Let him have what ? 

BLANCHE. 

One's scraps of leisure — one's ideas of life. 

MR. BONSOR. 

He's not a person for you to meet on a social basis. 

BLANCHE. 

Oh, I want to approach him in a missionary spirit. 

MR. BONSOR. 
You won't convert him. 

BLANCHE. 

Perhaps not. (Smiling.) But I'll clothe him ! 

MR. BONSOR. 

That is the first proper step ; but have you the material ? 

BLANCHE, laughing. 

Yards and yards and yards ! 

Re-enter Captain Chanter from the lower door on the right. 
CHANTER. 

Have they come ? 



286 THE REPROBATE 

MR. BONSOR. 
They've come. 

Enter Mrs. Doubleday and Paul from the hall while Blanche and 
Chanter converse. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, perceiving this. 

Captain ! (Chanter instantly quits Blanche and comes to her, a move- 
ment which leaves Paul exposed. As Blanche moves a little nearer to Paul 
Mrs. Doubleday resumes.) Paul ! 

PAUL, startled, coming down to her. 

Mamma ? 

Re-enter from the hall Pitt Brunt, with several volumes of Hansard under 
one arm and a portfolio under the other. 

PITT BRUNT, to Mr. Bonsor. 

May I work in the library ? 

MR. BONSOR, assenting. 

My niece will assist you. 

PITT BRUNT. 

Oh, Miss Amber ! 

MR. BONSOR. 

She's eager to listen to your speech. 

PITT BRUNT. 
She shall t (Then looking round complacently at the company.) 

Perhaps you'd all like to listen. 



ACT SECOND 287 

PAUL, very prompt. 

Mamma, would it be safe for me f 

PITT BRUNT, smiling. 

It wouldn't if you had to reply to me ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

He's never allowed to reply ! 

CHANTER, to Brunt. 

An arrangement is pending by which I shall henceforth 
answer for him. But I'm afraid that, for the present, 
we must occupy ourselves exclusively with this arrange- 
ment. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Before we enter upon it, I beg Mr. Bonsor to mention — 

MR. BONSOR, blank, while she pauses as if from delicacy. 

To mention — ? 

CHANTER. 

The nature of the connection about to be formed. 

BLANCHE, eager. 

Matrimonial ? 

PAUL, struck, echoing. 

Matrimonial ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, with reprobation. 

Paul! 



288 THE REPROBATE 

BLANCHE, wondering. 

Is that not the nature of the connection ? 

MR. BONSOR. with reprobation. 

Blanche ! 

BLANCHE, to Paul, snuling. 

But it must be either one thing or the other, musn't it ? 

PAUL. 

Fm never allowed to reply. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

You will therefore receive without comment — 

MR. BONSOR, as she hesitates. 

As / have done — 

CHANTER. 

The news of your mother's intended marriage — 

BLANCHE, as he hesiutes. 

To Captain Chanter, Fm sure. 

PAUL, struck, precipitate. 

The Captain ? — By jingo ! 

MR. BONSOR, privately, to Mrs. Doublbday. 

He hadn^t taken it in ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

We never crossed the line. 



ACT SECOND 289 

MR. BONSOR. 
It excites a train of thought. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

That was just our scruple. 

MR. BONSOR. 

He thinks it reheves him. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, emphatic. 

It doesn't ! 

PITT BRUNT, gay, to Mrs. Doubledav. 
I'm sorry for Mr. Bonsor ! (To Mr. Bonsor, summarily prcsentbg 
the Hansards in a pile.) JuSt take theSC. 

MR. BONSOR, vague, but receiving the Hansards. 

What am I to do with them ? 

PITT BRUNT, prompt. 

Verify. 

MR. BONSOR. 

Csin*t you verify? 

PITT BRUNT. 

I must give my attention to Miss Amber. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Miss Amber had better give hers to us / 

BLANCHE. 

With pleasure, Mrs. Doubleday.

MR&amp; DOUBLEDAY. 

To see Paul committed. 

PAUL, alarmed. 

Committed ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Vm going to make you over. 

PAUL, rueful. 

YouVe been trying that all my life ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

This time I shall succeed. I deliver you to the 
Captain. 

CHANTER, passing between Mrs. Doubleoay and Paul. 

I beg to acknowledge receipt ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, to Paul. 

You're to look up to him as youVe looked up to me, 

CHANTER. 

I become, as it were, your second mother. 

MR. BONSOR. 

As IVe been, as it were, your second father ! 

PAUL,^ resigned, bewildered. 

I seem to have plenty of relations ! 



ACT SECOND 291 

BLANCHE. 
Shouldn't you like a sister thrown in? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

The fkmily is quite large enough ! (Privately to Chanter.) 
I wanted her to take it in ! 

CHANTER. 
She shall take it in ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, who has extracted a small coin from herportemonnaie. 

Let me hand you this. 

CHANTER, with the coin, vague. 

Sixpence ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

His allowance. 

CHANTER. 

It doesn't pass through his hands ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

We apply it to some benevolent object. 

CHANTER, pocketing the sixpence. 

It shall be devoted to a worthy one ! 

MR. BONSOR, to Chanter. 

You'll find your place no sinecure. 

CHANTER, virtuous. 

No — but Mrs. Doubleday will breathe ! 



392 THE REPROBATE 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Not yet — I disseminate the news. 

CHANTER. 

You rush up to London ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

I rush to my writing-desk. 

Exit Mrs. DouBLEDAY to the halL 
PITT BRUNT, to Mr. Bonsor. 

I sent the others to your room. 

MR. BONSOR. 

Most kind of you.

MR. BONSOR, going up.

PITT BRUNT. 
You're forgetting these. (Takes and presents again those he has 

brought in.) Twenty in all. 

MR. BONSOR, impressive, to Blanche, as he takes the pile in his two anns. 

The Idol of the North ! 

Exit Mr. Bonsor to the hall with the books. 
PITT BRUNT, gracious, opening the door of the library to Blanche. 

He's ready to mount his pedestal 



ACT SECOND 293 

BLANCHE. 

Do you want me to hold it while you get on ? 

PITT BRUNT, smiling. 

It won't run away ! 

BLANCHE. 

I wish you would ! 

PITT BRUNT, arch, at the door of the library. 

For you to run after me ? 

Exit Pitt Brunt. 

CHANTER, looking from Blanche to Paul a moment, then refleaing, 
deciding and taking two half-crowns out of his pocket. 

Let me hand you this ! 

PAUL, with the money, surprised. 

Five shillings ? 

CHANTER. 

Your allowance. 

PAUL. 

Four and sixpence too much ! 

CHANTER. 

I change the system — I increase the sum ! 

PAUL, helpless, appealing. 

What shall I do with it ? 

CHANTER, gay, cynical. 

Whatever you like 1 



394 THE REPROBATE 

BLANCHE, looldDg from Paul to CHAimK ; then resoliitdy, as if with a 



Captain Chanter, will you leave me a moment with Mr. 
Paul? 

CHANTER. 

Do you want to rifle him ? 

BLANCHE 

I want to advise him ! 

CHANTER. 

As much as you like ! 

Exit Captain Chanter by the lower door on the right. 

PAUL, amazed, quite irandalisrd, looking after Chantek while he puts the 
money in his waistcoat-pocket. 

I can't look up to him I 

BLANCHE, laughing. 

He inspires me with positive reverence ! 

PAUL. 

Mamma wouldn't have left me with you ! 

BLANCHE. 

I wouldn't have asked her ! 

PAUL. 

Mr. Bonsor wouldn't have done it either ! 

BLANCHE. 
I wouldn't have asked him 1 



ACT SECOND 295 

PAUL. 
You knew your man, eh ? 

BLANCHE. 
I divined him ! 

PAUL. 

You just took a shot I 

BLANCHE. 

You see it succeeded 

PAUL. 
Yes, isn't it awful ? 

BLANCHE. 
Ah, don't say that when I'm fighting at your side ! 

PAUL. 
Thanks — ^but you do undermine me ! 

BLANCHE. 
Why, if I asked him to go it was on purpose to prop 
you up. 

PAUL. 

It's just when you prop me, you know, that I seem 
most to come down 1 

BLANCHE. 

Don't think of me as a mere young lady ; think of me 
as an invalid's attendant — as a doctor — as a district 
nurse. 



296 THE REPROBATE 

PAUL. 
A sort of sister of charity, eh ? 

BLANCHE. 

Yes, but not in the least of a strict order. 

PAUL. 

Strict orders are issued to me daily ! 

BLANCHE. 
Oh, I shall be easy with you, for I know you're in trouble. 

PAUL, anxious, looking round. 

Indeed I am in trouble ! 

BLANCHE. 

Your wild past comes back to you. 

PAUL. 

It came back last night. But it only stayed a minute. 

BLANCHE. 

Such minutes must be wonderful ! 

PAUL. 

They do upset one ! 

BLANCHE. 

They make you feel you live ! 

PAUL. 

Yes, but in the tomb of my reputation. 



ACT SECOND 297 

BLANCHE. 
Ah, you're not buried ; your tomb is open to the sky. 
You see the sun and the stars ; you feel the wind and 
the weather h 

PAUL. 

The wind and the weather very much, Miss Amber. I 
shouldn't wonder if I were taking cold ! 

BLANCHE 

What of that? You won't, at least, have vegetated! 

(Then as she goes.) / shall ! 

PAUL. 

Where are you going ? 

BLANCHE. 

To study to be a cabbage ! 

PAUL. 
Well, It's simpler 1 

BLANCHE. 

Oh, I shall be simple. I should say the penny kind ! 

PAUL. 
Meanwhile I must continue the struggle. 

BLANCHE. 
Yes, till you can fight no more ! 

PAUL. 

And when I can fight no more ?

PAUL, who has receded to the door of the library, looking at her in 
melandioly cwitemplation. 

Nina 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, stopping short in the middle of the stage 

No hug for Nina ? 

PAUL, checking her with his finger to his lips. 

When we hug they hear it ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Did they hear it last night ? 

PAUL. 
Distinctly. They rushed in. Fortunately you had 
rushed out. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Yes, my boy, you did bundle me ! 



ACT SECOND 299 

PAUL. 

How did you get in now ? 

MRa FRESHVILLE. 

The same way as before. Fve bought the butler. 

PAUL. 

Cubit must be rather expensive ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

A pound a visit. 

PAUL. 

It comes pretty high. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

About the same as a high-class doctor. But, my dear 

child, I consider you worth it ! (Looking at him a moment.) 

You do look so fresh ! 

PAUL, uneasy, distressed. 

Nina, I beg you not to allude to my appearance ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Why should you be ashamed of it ? You look awfully 
young. 

PAUL. 

\feel awfully young ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Taken care of yourself, eh ? 



30Q THE REPROBATE 

PAUL. 
I should say, rather, I have been taken care of ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Well, / haven't ! How do / look ? 

PAUL. 

You look like somebody else. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 
You think I've a different type ? 

PAUL. 

Haven't you got different hair ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Oh yes ; it used to be red 

PAUL. 

My dear, it used to be black ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Oh, black, was it ? Red the year before. But your's, 
darling, is the same ! 

PAUL. 

My hair may be the same, Nina, but everything else is 
changed. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 
Yes, everything does change, Dudley ! 



ACT SECOND 301 

PAUL. 
One's very name, to begin with. I'm not Dudley now ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, surprised. 

Then what are you, pray ? 

PAUL. 

A mere anonymous nobody ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, in friendly compassion. 

It's all over, eh ? 

PAUL. 

It was over long ago ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 
Short and SWieet, eh ? (Then as he checks her again, listening, with 

his finger to his lips.) What*s the matter ? 

PAUL. 

I thought they were coming ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, undisturbed. 

But they ain't, eh ? 

PAUL. 

I hope not. I'm trying to be good. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

So am I ; but I'm not very sure it pays ! 

PAUL, struck, suppliant. 

Ah, Nina, don't say that 1 



302 THE REPROBATE 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Why not, if it's true? You live up to a standard 
because you think some others do; and after you've 
had all the worry — 

PAUL, as she pauses. 

Yes, Nina? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Why, you find they don't ! 

PAUL, wondering. 

Don't they really ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

See what an awful sell ! You go spinning along the 
path of virtue, and if at the end of the run you happen 
to look back, what do you see ? 

PAUL. 

I never look back ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

All of them sitting down ! 

PAUL. 

I never sit down ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Partaking freely of refreshment. 

PAUL. 

1 never partake ! 



ACT SECOND 303 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

No more do I ; but I feel the want of it ! 

PAUL. 

You have your equivalent : you've acquired the habit of 
virtue. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Yes, that's the worst of it : youVe got to go on. 

PAUL. 

Let me earnestly entreat you to do so I 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

I'm going on ; that's what has brought me here ! 

PAUL. 

Yes, on the railroad of virtue this is certainly a lively 
station ! But how did you find it out ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

By the aid of the police. 

PAUL, alarmed. 

The police ? Are they after me ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

You, my dear fellow ? I didn't come for you ! 

PAUL, blank. 

Who did you come for ? 



304 THE REPROBATE 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Ain't there another rascal on the premises ? 

PAUL, amazed. 

Mr. Bonsor? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 
Try again ! 

PAUL. 

Captain Chanter ? (Then perceiving her assent.) The police 
are after him i 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Not now — but / am ! It's better. 

PAUL. 

What do you want of him ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 
I want to marry him. 

PAUL. 

Marry him ? Why, he's engaged ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Right you are — to me, 

PAUL, stupefied. 

You and my mother ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Is she your mother ? 



ACT SECOND 305 

PAUL. 
My stepmother. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

That monster ? 

PAUL. 

Don't abuse her, Nina — she's my guardian ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Your guardian ? (Struck.) Are you the common object ? 

PAUL, blank. 

The common object ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

That I heard about yesterday — such a peculiar case. 

PAUL. 

1 am 3, peculiar case ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

You're vicious, eh ? 

PAUL. 

Fundamentally ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, dubious. 

So bad you require fufo of them ? 

PAUL. 

I require three — with the Captain.

MRS. FRESHVILLE, amaied 

Is he one ? 

PAUL. 

He looks after my morals. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

And who looks after his ? 

PAUL, wondering, artless. 

Why, I thought they were perfect ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

So did I. But they ain't ! 

PAUL, thinking. 

That won't suit Mamma ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Then let her drop him ! 

PAUL. 

That won't suit him I 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

He's too particular. Leave him to me, 

PAUL, anxious. 

And what'U you do with him ? 



ACT SECOND 307 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 
Do with him ? (After an instant, considering.) ScC hc IctS 

you alone. 

PAUL, anxious. 

Then what'U become of me ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

I'll look after you myself! 

PAUL, astonished. 

After both of us ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 
It will be all one job ! (After looking at him a moment.) As 

for you — I don't believe it ! 

PAUL. 

Don't believe what ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Why, that you're a peculiar case. 

PAUL. 

Then look at the evidence ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Hang the evidence ! Try — and see. 

PAUL. 
Try? Try what? 



3o8 THE REPROBATE 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Try everything ! 

PAUL. 

Why, everything's wrong 1 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

You are, my dear, to begin with ! Everything's right ! 

PAUL, bewUdered. 

Everything's deuced awkward, at any rate ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLK 

Your dear old face, as you say that, comes back to me ! 

PAUL. 

Don't let it, Nina — ^for heaven's sake send it away ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

With that sweet little waxed moustache. What have 
you done with the ends ? 

PAUL. 

They've followed those of all the candles and cigars ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

The burnt-out fires? — the withered flowers? You 
always had a lovely buttonhole. 

PAUL. 

I've given up buttonholes — they look too dissolute. 



ACT SECOND 309 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Dissolute ? — the flowers of the field ? I never heard of 
such rot ! 

PAUL. 

Neither have I, Nina ! But they wouldn't like me to 
say so. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

" They " ? Mamma and the Captain ? 

PAUL. 

Perhaps the Captain wouldn't object — 

MRS.*FRESHVILLE. 

I should like to see him ! 

PAUL. 

But such an expression wouldn't go unrebuked by Mr. 
Bonsor. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

The old busybody who chased you to Paris ? 

PAUL, prompt. 

Oh, he was my father ! (Then struck.) Gracious, what 
have I said? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

The simple truth. They did make a rumpus about 
nothing ! 

PAUL. 

Not exactly nothing ! 



3IO THE REPROBATE 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Nothing worth speaking of ! 

PAUL. 

I don't speak of it ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

But they do still, eh ? 

PAUL. 

To every one they see ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

To the Captain, do you suppose ? 

PAUL. 

Oh, above all to the Captain ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, after consideration. 

Well, that's no matter. He doesn't know it was me. 

PAUL. 

He'll find it out. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

I don't care if he does ! 

PAUL. 

Not if he wants to marry you ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

He doesn't ! 



ACT SECOND 311 

PAUL, reasoning, perplexed. 

Still — if he*s engaged — ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

He's engaged to your mamma. If he can stand your 
mamma, he can stand me. 

PAUL. 
But how can he marry you both ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Trust him to manage it — if it's necessary ! But it ain't 
necessary. 

PAUL. 

I'm glad of that ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

He'll chuck your mamma. 

PAUL, rueful. 

So that I shall receive her on the rebound ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, struck, compassionate. 

No, that won't do, you poor dear, will it ? (After another 
instant, sociable.) We did hit it ofF, me and you, didn't we, 
Dud? 

PAUL. 

I confess I was rather afraid of you. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE 

You've got over that, I hope ! 



3ia THE REPROBATE 

PAUL. 

I think I'm gaining confidence. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

So am I, though you gave me, last night, a turn. 

PAUL. 

I didn't sleep a wink ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Nor me, fancy ! I thought of the old days — of the way 
I used to sing to you ! 

PAUL, beguiled. 

Do you remember your old songs ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, eager. 

Should you like to hear one ? 

PAUL, suddenly alarmed. 

Heavens, no ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, as he goes up, on his guard. 

They're out of fashion now ; they've got a new lot ! 

PAUL, coming down. 

Are you still at the Waterloo ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Dear, no ; bless the old shop ! 



ACT SECOND 3i3 

PAUL, after an instant, gentle. 

Your voice was very sweet, Nina. 

MRS. ^FRESHVILLE. 

So was yours, old chap. Do you still sing ? 

PAUL, aghast. 

Sing ? Why, I scarcely speak ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

I remember how little you thought of your own powers. 
You only wanted me to develop ! 

PAUL. 

I'm bound to say you did develop ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Through the course of instruction you so liberally pro- 
vided. It was for that we went to Paris. 

PAUL, recalling, recognising. 

Yes, it was simply for that ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Our musical studies. Where was the awful harm ? 

PAUL, thinking. 

After all, where was it ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

We simply went in for a thorough course. 



314 THE REPROBATE 

PAUL. 
We thought It our duty to hear what they were doing. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. reminiscent, wbtfuL 

Ah, they do such a lot ! What was that place ? The 
Alcazar! 

PAUL. 

And that other ? The Eldorado ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

And the Valentino ! 

PAUL. 

And the Solferino ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

That was where at last they collared us ! 

PAU L, starting, seeing Chanter. 

They've collared us again ! 

Re-enter Captain Chanter, with a yellow-covered French novel and a box of 
cigars, by the lower door on the right. 

CHANTER, bland. 

Good morning, Mrs. Freshville, 

PAUL, surprised. 

Is that your name now ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, ominous, looking at Chanter. 

Not the one he generally uses ! Didn't I mention that 
IVe been married ? 



ACT SECOND 315 

CHANTER, smiling. 

You must have had so much else to say ! (To Paul.) 
She belongs to the category of irresistible widows. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

But not to the most irresistible part of it. (With intensity, to 
Chanter.) Those with five thousand a year. 

PAUL, to Chanter ; still meek and respectful, but explanatory and ludd. 

I've had the pleasure of some previous acquaintance 
with Mrs. Freshville, 

CHANTER, genial. 

My dear fellow, I know all about it ! 

PAUL, to Mrs. Freshville, rueful. 

He knows all about it ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

I don't care a rap what he knows ! 

CHANTER, frank and gay. 
I shall make you care ! (To Paul, sociable, handing the cigar-box.) 

Have a Regalia ? 

PAUL, looking at the cigars hard an instant, then hard at Chanter, as if to 
fathom his tortuous ways. 

What will Mamma say ? 



3i6 THE REPROBATE 

CHANTER, smiling, tempting. 

I won't tell her ! (Paul, hesitating, takes a cigar out of the case, turns 
away with it and stands a moment looking at it. Chanter, meanwhile, selects 
one for himself. Paul, suddenly, with a nervous movement, jerks away his 
own cigar, tosses it on a table and goes up, uneasily, nervously. Chanter, 
lighting a cigar, continues to Mrs. Freshvillb.) Shall I offer yOU 

one? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, with her hand on her pocket. 

I've got my cigarettes ! (Feeling.) No, I haven't ; they're 

in my reticule. (Looking, with renewed despair, about her.) Where 

the dickens is it ? 

CHANTER, cool, without moving. 

Don't mind I'll find it ! (Then to Paul.) I say, here's a 
book for you. 

PAUL, eager, coming down. 

A book ? 

CHANTER, handing him his yellow-Covered volume. 

A little French novel ! 



Zola? 



Zola! 



PAUL, timid, taking the book. 



CHANTER, puffing his cigar. 



PAUL, gazing at the cover. 

What will Mamma say ? 



ACT SECOND 317 

CHANTER. 



I won't tell her ! 



Patil turns away slowly, with his novel, as he has done with his cigar, and 
looks in the same way at the cover without opening it. Then he tosses it 
down, as he has tossed his cigar, and goes up, with the same nervous move- 
ment, to stand an instant at the window and look out at the lawn. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, seated, to Chanter. 

Ain't you ashamed, you horrid thing ? 

CHANTER. 
Ain't you, you designing woman ? (Then as he draws a pack of 
cards from his pocket and holds it out to Paul.) I Say, choOSe a Card. 

PAUL, alert, coming down. 

A card? 

CHANTER. 

One of these, 

PAUL. 

What will Mamma say ? 

CHANTER 

I won't tell her ! 

PAUL, looking at the cards, fascinated but hesitating. 

What are you doing ? 

CHANTER. 

A little trick. Take any you like. (As Paul draws out a card.) 
What is it? 

PAUL. 

The Queen of Hearts ! 



'3i8 THE REPROBATE 

MR&amp; FRESHVILLE, seated. 

Graceful allusion to me / 

CHANTER. 

Please keep it till I tak^ it back. 

Paul turns away in the same manner as before, stops, looks irresolutely at the 
card, then gets rid of it as he has done of the cigar and the book. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, to Chanter, nodding at his pack. 

My old pack ? 

CHANTER, vague. 

Yours? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

The one we generally use. 

CHANTER. 
I just sent out to buy it. (Then after he has pbiced the cards well 
in evidence on the table.) Dudley ! 

PAUL, more dryly, coming down. 

Sir? 

CHANTER. 

Will you do me a favour ? You'll find on the table in 
my room — 

PAUL, anxious, as Chanter pauses. 

I shall find—? 

CHANTER. 

A flask of brandy. 



ACT SECOND 319 

PAUL, blank. 

What shall I do with it ? 

CHANTER. 

Anything you like ! 

PAUL, horrified. 

Captain, have mercy on me ! 

CHANTER. 
Then bring it here to me ! (As Paul looks at Wm in a silcm 
appeal, he adds.) Do get it, old fcUoW ! 

PAUL, divided, to Mrs. FrBShvillb. 

Shall I get it ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Oh, I don't care what mamma says ! 

PAUL, after another instant, snapping his fingers. 

No more then do I ! 

Exit Paul Doubleday to the hall. 
MRS. FRESHVILLE, rising, abrupt. 

Are the invitations out ? 

CHANTER. 

I haven't the faintest idea what you mean ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

For your marriage to that old dragon. 



320 THE REPROBATE 

CHANTER. 
I suppose I may keep a secret — after discovering that 
you've nurtured one for years. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

All the more that yours is so horrid I Dudley liked 
me, and I liked him, and I'm not ashamed of it I was 
grateful to him for his interest in my voice. 

CHANTER, sarcastic. 

Oh, your voice ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Don't sniff at it — you were glad enough to hear it ! 

CHANTER. 

And to which of us, this morning, have you come here 
to sing ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

You'll understand when I tell you that though last 
night I had engaged my room at the inn, I went back 
to town for my music. 

CHANTER. 

Your music ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Perhaps I ought to say yours ! Your notes of hand. 

CHANTER. 

The stuff I wrote you? (Thinking.) You can't make a 
scene with my letters now. 



ACT SECOND 321 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Why ain't it a happy moment ? 

CHANTER. 

Simply because you'll do for Dudley. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

I don't mind that — if I do for you ! 

CHANTER 

Where are the few lines I inadvertently traced ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

There are enough, of them to stuff out my pocket. 

(As he looks at her, up and down, askance.) YoU needn't CFOUCh 

for a spring — I'll fight for them ! 

CHANTER, nervous, throwing away his cigar. 

You're criminally vulgar ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 
I often think it's a comfort ! But I feel as if I had a 
small family in my pocket, and now I should like my 
reticule. 



Chanter goes to the cupboard on the right, in which Mr. Bonsor has placed 
the reticule, and takes it out. He brings it to her and she receives it and 
opens it. She pulls out Blanche's railway novel, which Mr. Bonsor has 
put into it, and looks at the book with surprise. Then she flings it down 
on the table. 

That book's not mine ! 

VOL. II Y 



322 THE REPROBATE 

CHANTER, taking up the book. 
Who's is it? (Reading the name on the title page.) Blanche 

Amber? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, who has fumbled in the reticule, in dismay. 

And the photo's gone ! 

CHANTER. 
The photo ? 

I MRS. FRESHVILLE, looking about her, vexed. 

Dudley's ! 

CHANTER. 

Was it in there ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

I carry it about 

CHANTER. 

And what do you do with mine ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Lock it up at home ! Where is the confounded thing ? 

CHANTER, still with Blanche's book. 

Some one obviously sneaked it. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, vague. 

Who the mischief — ? 

CHANTER. 

The person who left this instead. 



ACT SECOND 323 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

That nasty book ? Who is the brute ? 

CHANTER. 

The brute is Miss Blanche Amber. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, recalling. 

The girl who arrived yesterday ? 

CHANTER. 

Just in time to grab it ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

The one who's engaged to the public man ? 

CHANTER. 

The member for Blackport ? They're not engaged 
quite yet. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

He's awfully spoony. 

CHANTER. 

Well, s/ie isn't ! (After a moment.) I'll get the photograph 
back from her. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Very good of you. Get it immediately. 

CHANTER. 

You must give me time — she'll cleave to it ! 



324 THE REPROBATE 

MRS. FRESHVILLK 

Cleave to my property — ^the horrid little thief? 

CHANTER. 

You must allow for her feelings ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. vague. 

What feelings, pray ? 

CHANTER. 

Why, she's in love with him I 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

With Dudley ? Since when ? 

CHANTER, with assurance. 

Since yesterday ! He makes them toe the mark ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Does he make them steal ? 

CHANTER 

He makes them do anything ! 

He goes up rapidly to the window as soon as he has spoken ; while Mrs. 
FRESHVILLE sinks slowly again into the chair from which she has risen, 
and, with her reticule open on her knees, transfers to it mechanically, with 
an air of intense preoccupation, one by one, a dozen loose letters that she 
has taken from her pocket. She takes them out successively, looking at 
the superscriptions. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, who has counted the letters and fastened her reticule. 

Thirteeft, and five telegrams ! 



ACT SECOND 325 

CHANTER, who has stood uneasily at the window, coming down, looking 
at his watch. 

Give me half an hour, and I'll bring you the photo at 
the inn ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, rising again, smiling, with the reticule on her arm. 

In exchange for your letters ? Too dear ! 

CHANTER. 

Oh, bother my letters — do what you like with them ! 
Make any row your bad taste may suggest, but for 
heaven's sake let it be a row that won't hurt Dudley ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 
Hurt him — how ? 

CHANTER. 
By showing that you and he are at it again ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

We ain't at it again ! 

CHANTER. 

You present an appearance of it that won't improve his 
situation. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

His situation's a farce I 

CHANTER. 

So it is, but you must sit the farce out. 



326 THE REPROBATE 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

And you ? Were you sitting it out just now ? 

CHANTER. 

Oh, Tm in the performance. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

As the leading villain ? You corrupt his innocence ? 

CHANTER. 

His innocence is a thin veneer. Scratch the Russian 
and you find the Tartar — scratch Paul and you find 
Dudley ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Well, if you scratch him again I'll scratch you^ I can 
promise you ! 

CHANTER. 

I'm weak with him — I humour him — I spoil him : all 
that I admit. But that's nothing compared to the 
mess that you'll make for him by compromising him. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, after a moment. 

You're a mass of deceit, but I don't see what you'll 
gain by not bringing me the photo. 

CHANTER, pressing, watchful. 

I swear to you I'll bung it in half an hour. I hear 
some one coming ! 



ACT SECOND 327 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, thinking. 

Poor dear old Dud ! (Then to Chanter.) It's a pity you're 
such a fiend ! 

CHANTER, pleading, feverish. 

Don\ you be one — don't sacrifice him ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, looking at her watch. 

In half an hour ? 

CHANTER. 

To the minute ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

You're unspeakable — but I've got you ^re / (She slaps her 

reticule triumphantly and goes up.) 

CHANTER, who is up before her, listening by the door of the hall and 
checking her. 

Wait! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, indicating the lower door on the right. 

I won't go in there again ! 

CHANTER, passing quickly to the window. 

This way ! It's an escape ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, as she goes; warning. 

Not (or you/ 

Exit Mrs. FRESHVILLE to the lawn. 
CHANTER, alone, exhausted but exultant. 

She has "got" me, eh? Not quite so tight as I've 
got her /

PAUL, looking about him after a g es tur e ofdisgnsted repodiatian. 

She's gone ? 

CHANTER, laying the flask on a table. 

Thank our stars ! 

PAUL, breaking out. 

I say, you know — ^what are you up to ? 

CHANTER, with sadden wild gestmes. 

I'm in a fever — I'm in a frenzy : my head goes round ! 

(As Paul stares at bim, bewildered.) I dou't knOW what I Say 

I don't know what I do ! 



PAUL, after a I 

You seem indeed in an extraordinary position ! 

CHANTER. 

Dudley, I throw myself on your mercy ! 

PAUL. 

If you really want it, don't call me Dudley. 

CHANTER. 

I'll call you anything you like if you'll only help me. 



ACT SECOND 329 

PAUL. 
How on earth can I help you ? 

CHANTER. 

By your generous influence. I was an ass to yield to 
her! 

PAUL. 

To yield to Mamma ? 

CHANTER. 

No, tMt was inevitable. 

PAUL. 

So I've always found it ! 

CHANTER. 

I succumbed — originally — to Nina. 

PAUL. 
It wasn't original ! Where did you meet her ? 

CHANTER, waving away inquiries. 

Oh, in society ! She has my written vows. 

PAUL, struck. 

I wonder if she has mine ! 

CHANTER. 

Oh, yours don't matter ! 

PAUL. 

Don't they, though ! 



330 THE REPROBATE 

CHANTER. 

They shatit matter, Paul, if you'll save me ! 

PAUL. 

How on earth can I save you ? 

CHANTER. 

As I tell you, by squaring her. 

PAUL, vague. 

Squaring Mrs. Doubleday? 

CHANTER. 
Squaring Mrs. Freshville ! (More agiuted the more he thinks.) 

It's quite too awful ! 

PAUL, considering. 

How far have you gone with her ? 

CHANTER. 

With Mrs. Freshville ? Very far indeed. I once went 
to Brighton. 

PAUL. 

Oh, / went to Paris ! 

CHANTER. 

I know you did ; so you can feel for me ! (Going up.) 
Keep her quiet ! 

PAUL. 

Where are you going ? 



ACT SECOND 331 

CHANTER, with wUd gestures. 

Away — away ! 

PAUL. 
Who then will keep me quiet ? 

CHANTER. 

You mustn't be quiet ; you must act ! 

PAUL, staring, wondering. 

Act? 

CHANTER. 

Save me ! By-bye ! 

Exit Chanter rapidly to the hall. 
PAUL, alone, still blank. 

That's all very well ; but who'll save me ? (He moves about 

during the rest of his soliloquy, looking round him, wonderingly, interrogatively, 
as he sifts his situation in his mind, taking up successively and laying down 
again the different objects he mentions.) I'm In dreadful danger, I 

suppose ! I must be, for I'm face to face with every- 
thing that, for years, I've been taught to dread — Aave 
dreaded. Tobacco, cards, wine, (then taking up the French novel) 
women ! Here they are — all in a row ! (Looking round him.) 
The real thing — and I'm alone with them ! I'm therefore 
free, ain't I ? free as I haven't been since — Ah, when 
was it ? It seems only yesterday ; yet it seems another 

life ! (With the different objects again.) Womeu, wiuC, Cards, 
tobacco ! (As he tosses the cigar into the box again.) Temptation, 

ain't it ? Yes, it must be : what else can it be ? I'm 
tempted ! The danger's right here at last — the danger 



332 THE REPROBATE 

of the happy chance ! Well, the happy chance is just 
what I can't resist. (After a moment.) Is it, indeed ? Pray, 

why can't I ? (Standing off with his hands in his pockets, looking at the 

different things.) Bccausc I'm the slavc of my passions, 
and ray passions, alas, are awful ! (Taking up the flask of Kquor.) 
This, for instance — this is one of my passions. (He has 

uncorked the flask ; he smells it) Do I ycam for it ? Somchow 

I don't feel as if I did ! Could I even raise it to my 
lips ? (After an instant) What's the matter with me that I 

can't? (Still with the flask in his hand.) Tm wickcd I'm 

weak — I can't be trusted ; and yet my funny fate takes 
it into her head to trust me ! She treats me all of a 
sudden with flattering confidence. (Thinking.) It may 
be a trap of my funny fate. But if it's a trap, I ain't 
caught ! I am resisting ; I have resisted. (Following up 
his induction.) I ain't SO bad, then, now ; I must be getting 

better ! (StiU standing with the uncorked flask in his hand, he sees Pitt 
Brunt. Re-enter Pitt Brunt from the library ; to whom, as the idea last 
uttered comes over him, he breaks out spontaneously, joyously, artlessly.) I 

say. Brunt, I'm getting better ! 



Pitt Brunt, with his pen stuck into his ear, surprised at the image Paul 
presents with his uncorked flask, approaches him as if supposing him intoxi- 
cated. He takes the flask from him and smells it ; then, in horror at its 
contents, replaces it in his hand, looking at him with high superiority. 



PITT BRUNT. 
On brandy ? (He crosses to the lower door on the right, where he pauses 
an instant and gives Paul another look of shocked reprobation.) Out of 

the very bottles ? 

Exit Pitt Brunt by the lower door on the right. 



ACT SECOND 333 

PAUL, alone, stares, reflects a moment, then corks and puts down hb flask 
with a sigh of resignation, taking up mechanically the French novel. 

No one will ever believe it ! 

Re-enter Blanche Amber from the library. 
BLANCHE, at the door. 

Are you still alone ? 

PAUL. 

More alone than ever. 

BLANCHE. 

Then I'll come in. 

PAUL. 

Do ; he won't mind ! 

BLANCHE. 

Do you mean the member for Blackport ? 

PAUL. 

Oh no, not your keeper. Mine ! 
BLANCHE. 

Mine has left me too ; gone to my uncle for an idea. 

PAUL. 

Couldn't you give him one ? 

BLANCHE. 

1 gave him twenty, but he was afraid of them all. 

PAUL, smiling. 

I fancy you've some terrible ideas ; eh. Miss Amber ? 



334 THE REPROBATE 

BLANCHE. 
Not SO bad as some of yours, Mr. Paul ! 

PAUL. 

Oh, you exaggerate mine ! 

BLANCHE. 

Scarcely, when you've confessed to so mapy ! 

PAUL, embarrassed. 

Yes, I've made a clean breast ! 

BLANCHE. 

Don't dissimulate, then : keep it up ! 

PAUL, vague. 

Keep it up ? 

BLANCHE. 

Your honourable frankness. Your desperate candour. 

PAUL. 

It does win me your sympathy ? 

BLANCHE. 

As nothing else could ! 

PAUL, after an instant, resolute. 

Then I will keep it up. 

BLANCHE. 

There's plenty of it, whenever you require it. 



ACT SECOND 335 

PAUL. 
I should like to take it all, and keep it for ever ! 

BLANCHE, smiling. 

Take it in instalments — a dose every day. 

PAUL. 

Then such a person as me isn't repulsive to you ? 

BLANCHE. 

Repulsive — in your lonely grandeur ? 

PAUL. 

Oh, Miss Amber, Vm lonely, but I'm not particularly 
grand ! I'm a kind of moral leper, with a warning cow- 
bell round my neck. It's the solitude of misfortune. 

BLANCHE. 

It's better than the rush and crush of vulgar happiness. 
Do you know what you remind me of? 

PAUL. 

Of any victim of fatality, I suppose — any freak of nature 
or melancholy monster : the pig-faced lady or the pie- 
bald man ! 

BLANCHE. 

You remind me of some great wide-winged, wounded 

bird! 

PAUL. 

Do you feel like the sportsman who has brought him 
down ? Do you want to keep me as a trophy ? 



336 THE REPROBATE 

BLANCHE. 

Stuffed — in a glass case? No, I want you living; I 
want you fluttering; I want you perched on your rock, 
at least, if you must be tied to it ! 

PAUL. 

Dear Miss Amber, I'll perch anywhere, if you'll perch 
near me ! I hope you've come here to stay. 

BLANCHE. 

I'll stay as long as you hold out. But I said to you a 
while ago that I would tell you what to do in case at 
last you can't. 

PAUL. 

I can scarcely hold out now. 

BLANCHE. 

Then give in ! 

PAUL, agitated. 

Give in ? 

BLANCHE. 
If you must slip up — 

PAUL, as she hesitates. 

If I must ? 

BLANCHE. 
Do it immensely! (Then as for the first time she' becomes conscious of 

the book in his hand.) But it seems to me you have slipped up !

PAUL, who has put the book quickly behind him. 

Immensely !

Even to that? 

PAUL, flinging it down. 

Even to that !

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, sniffing the air as she comes down. 
Tobacco ? (To Blanche, as she tosses down her cigar.) Are yOU 

smoking with him ? 

BLANCHE, deciding and indicating the flask after an instant during which 
Mrs. Doubleday peremptorily rings the bell. 

Yes and drinking ! (Then indicating each of the other objects.) 

And gambling ! And reading a dreadful book. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, seeing the name as Blanche waves the book. 

Zola? 

BLANCHE. 

Zola ! 

PAUL. 

Dear mamma — it's Miss Amber's German humour. 
She has but this moment come into the room !

Don't tell her ! 

BLANCHE. 

Then you tell her ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, to Paul ; formidable.

Dear no, I shouldn't call it neglect !

Have you seen Captain Chanter ? 

CUBIT, with his letters stamped. 

I think he left the house, ma'am.

Don't post them. They are to announce a marriage 
which will probably not take place. 

PAUL, at the left, privately, with decbion, to Blanche, who has come down 
again on his left. 

It shall take place ! (He surreptitiously catches her right hand with 
his left and gives it a shake which she surreptitiously returns — a movement 
perceived by Mr. Bonsor.) 

MR. BONSOR, going up. 

Blanche ! 

She quickly joins him, and, after a few words, when they have gone up, he 
appears to dismiss her disapprovingly. Exit Blanche to the hall.

CUBIT. 

But Mr. Bonsor —

Hang Mr. Bonsor ! 

CUBIT, astounded ; then, with a gesture, smiling and taking another line. 

What'U you give me ? 

PAUL. 
For hanging Mr. Bonsor ? (Taking from his waistcoat-pocket the 
money Chanter has given him.) This !

Five shillings ? (Delighted.) I'll post them ! 

Exit Cubit to the hall.

No ! (After an inataoL) That's what IVc comc back to 
tell you ! 

PAUL, dvil, bat vague. 

Very good of you to come back ! 

MRS. FRESH VI LLE. with sudden utensity. 

Dudley — my feelings dragged me! I don't want any 
one in the world if I can only get you ! 

PAUL, confused. 

Me, Nina? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

My earliest friend — my most generous — and my best ! 

PAUL, embarrassed. 

My dear Nina, do I understand that you desire to make 
me your husband ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

That's the description of you that I confess I should 
find it most convenient to be able to give. 

PAUL. 

But isn't your proposal rather rashly precipitate ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Precipitate — when for years I've loved you in silence ? 
That silence, when I see you, I naturally break ! 



ACT SECOND 347 

PAUL. 

But I thought the object of your affection was our 
whimsical friend the Captain. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

So did I, till I perceived that I was fundamentally mis- 
taken. The Captain, though whimsical, is attractive; 
but he has no heart. You have a heart, Dudley. 

PAUL. 

Ah, but it doesn't make me attractive ! Nothing can ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Your situation can — your situation does. You suffer. 

PAUL. 

Oh, I can bear it ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

I can't then — when you're a captive ! 

PAUL. 
Captivity has changed me — I'm not what I was ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Never mind what you were — you'll do very well. 
You're still young — you're still charming — you're still 
free. 

PAUL. 

Free ? Why, you recognise yourself that I'm bound ! 



348 THE REPROBATE 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, suspicious, seizing his arm. 

" Bound "—to whom ? 

PAUL, alter an instant. 

No one — in the way you mean ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Then come to Paris ! 

PAUL, moved. 

To Paris? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

To the Alcazar ! 

PAULp struck, thinking. 

The Eldorado? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

The Valentino ! 

PAUL. 

The Solferino ? (After a moment.) Too late ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, resentful. 

Too late ? It isn't too late for me to chivey your photo- 
graph about ! 

PAUL, vague. 

My photograph ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, indicating her reticule. 

In this thing — wherever I go! (Abrupt.) Dudley, who 
stole it ? 



ACT SECOND 349 

PAUL, blank. 

I haven't the least idea ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Then /have! 

PAUL. 

Who in the world ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, reconsidering. 

I'll tell you when we're married ! 

PAUL. 

Dear Nina, marriage is a serious step— a step to think 
well over. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

We'll think it well over — together ! 

PAUL. 

Give me more time, Nina ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

How much more do you want ? 

PAUL, after an instant. 

Why, say till to-morrow. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Then to-morrow I'll rush to you. 

PAUL. 

Thank you — I'll rush to you. 



350 THE REPROBATE 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

At the inn ? Will they let you ? 

PAUL, after reflection, with extreme resolution. 

I won't ask them ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, irrepressible, triumphant. 

Ah, I've got you ! 

PAUL, struck, wondering. 

Have you, Nina ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, with a laugh. 

Don't look at me as if I had said I'd got the measles ! 
Look at me as if you really remembered — 

PAUL, as she hesitates. 

Remembered, Nina? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

That I'm a dear good soul. 

PAUL. 

You are^ Nina. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

And that I give you a radical change. 

PAUL. 

You do, Nina. By-bye. 



ACT SECOND 351 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 
Sy-byC (She goes up and then comes down again, while he stands lost 
in thought.) JuSt look here, Dud (Then after an instant.) Why 

arrangements ? 

PAUL, vague. 

Arrangements ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

What you call preluninaries. Fly with me without 'em ! 
The preliminaries can follow. 

PAUL, vague. 

Do you allude to our luggage ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. laughing. 

You are a daisy ! Let me pluck you now ! 

PAUL, rueful, imrcady. , 

This moment ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

You shrink — ^you desire some regular form ? 

PAUL. 

I've been taught in all these years that some regular 
form is proper. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Then we'll have one — iox youl And we'll see about it 

to-morrow. (At the window, smiling, bantering.) Propriety ! 

Exit Mrs. FRESHVILLE to the lawn. 



352 THE REPROBATE 

PAULp as he sees Chanter. 

Poor old Nina ! 

Re-enter Captain Chanter from the library. 

CHANTERf who has looked in first cantiously and speaks in a load, 
eager whisper. 

Well? 

PAUL. 

She wants me to go to Paris ! 

CHANTER 

Then why the deuce don*^ you ? 

PAUL. 

Because I don't want to ! 

CHANTER, blank, vexed. 

Don't " want " to ? 

PAUL, excited. 

Not the least bit in the world ! 

CHANTER 

Then you ougAf to want to ! 

PAUL. 

Isn't that just my difficulty — that I don't do what I 
ought ? 

CHANTER 

I'm here to make you. You're free ! 



ACT SECOND 353 

PAUL, passing his hand over his head. 

That's just whercr it is ! — I'm free ! She wants me to 
fly with her. 

CHANTER. 

Don't stand pottering, then. Fly ! 

PAUL. 
I can't fly ! 

CHANTER, trying to push him off. 

You must ! 

PAUL, disengaging himself with a flare of passion, and coming round and down. 

I won't ! 

CHANTER. 

What the devil's the matter with you ? 

PAUL. 

I don't know, Captain ! I ain't so bad---I ain't tempted ! 

CHANTER, indignant. 

'.You dre tempted ! 

PAUL. 

Then I resist ! 

CHANTER, furious. 

Wretch ! 

Re-enter Cubit from the hall. 
CUBIT, to Chanter." 

Mrs. Doubleday's quite wild, sir.

THE REPROBATE 



CHANTER. 



I go to her. (To Paul, privately, with concentrated urgency, as he 

goes up.) Nina's a revelation ! Try her ! 

Exit Captain Chanter to the hall. 
CUBIT, to Paul. 

Letters gone, sir ! 

PAUL, with rising spirit. 

Well, I ain't, old man, ami? 

CUBIT, surprised, gratified. 

No indeed, sir ; you seem quite on the spot ! 

Exit Cubit to the hall. 

PAUL, alone, echoing, with the sense of his victory growing stronger, over- 
whelming him at last. 

" Nina's a revelation"? There are other revelations than 
Nina ! *' Try her " ? I don't wanf to try her ! I don't 
want to try anybody ! (Looking about him.) I don't want to 

do anything ! (Drops into the chair on the right of the table.) What 

is the matter with me ? I am free and I ain't bad ! 

Upon my honour (rising slowly with the force of the revelation and 

the surprise) I bclieve that, after all — it's awfully queer 

(pauses a moment, then drops back into the chair) UpOn my honOUr, 

I'm good / 



ACT THIRD 

Mr Bonsor's drawing-room. Blanche Amber comes in from the 
hall, meeting Pitt Brunt, dressed in the same manner as at the 
beginning of Act First, who comes in from the garden. 

PITT BRUNT. 

Dear Miss Amber, Tm delighted to put in a few minutes 
with you — my solitude, since luncheon, has been posi- 
tively uncanny. 

BLANCHE. 

Haven't you had my uncle to comfort you ? 

PITT BRUNT. 

There's no comfort in your uncle, now that Mr. 
Doubleday has disappeared ! 

BLANCHE. 

Isn't there any in Mrs. Doubleday — exhilarated by the 
triumph of her charms ? 

PITT BRUNT. 

She buries her charms at the railway-station — waiting 
for the fugitive to alight I 



356 THE REPROBATE 

BLANCHE, disappointed. 

You don't mean to say he returns so soon ! 

PITT BRUNT. 

I don't know, dear Miss Amber, what you call " soon." 
(Looking athb watch.) A dcbauch of twenty hours ! 

BLANCHE. 

Why, he went for at least sixty ! 

PITT BRUNT, surprised. 

Did he communicate to you his programme ? 

BLANCHE. 

It was impossible — yesterday afternoon — to remain 
.gnorant of his condition. 

PITT BRUNT. 

Indeed it was 1 

BLANCHE. 

When he was missed — I understood. I know that 
when such natures fall — 

PITT BRUNT. 

They fall to the very bottom ? Tve no doubt whatever 
that he's as far down as you can go. Fortunately 
Captain Chanter has been let down after him. 

BLANCHE. 

By a rope round the waist — to pull him out ? I per- 
fectly know for what purpose he followed Mr. Paul to 
London. 



ACT THIRD 357 

PITT BRUNT. 

The engagement he had conscientiously taken left him 
no alternative, and he surmounted the repugnance he 
naturally felt When he brings the culprit back we 
shall clear up the mystery of where the money came 
from — the money for Doubleday's fare. 

BLANCHE. 

By the train to town ? It was only two shillings. 

PITT BRUNT. 

He had no such amount in his possession. We are 
reluctantly driven to the belief that he stole the two 
shillings. 

BLANCHE, indignant. 

Your beliefs a false belief ! He didn't I 

PITT BRUNT. 

To say nothing of the money for the other excesses that 
were his objective. You admitted just now that such 
natures sink to the bottom. Well, the bottom is theft ! 

BLANCHE. 

Then he stopped half-way. He borrowed the money. 

PITT BRUNT. 

From whom, pray — since the very servants have been 
examined ? (Then as she remains silent.) Will you accompany 
me on the river ? I put in an hour each day, and my 
hour has come round. 



358 THE REPROBATE 

BLANCHE. 
Your hour may have come round, Mr. Brunt, but your 
humble servant hasn't. You don't take the right way to 
make her ! 

PITT BRUNT. 

I'll take it in the boat. (Confident, engaging.) You See if I 
don't ! 

BLANCHE, impatient. 

Ah, your boat's not my boat, and it's impossible for me 
to embark with you ! 

PITT BRUNT, more pressing. 

I want you to embark, you know, on the river of life ; 
to float with me down the crystal stream — 

BLANCHE. 

That flows into the Smutt at Blackport? I don't find 
that a tempting voyage ! 

PITT BRUNT, as Mr. Bonsor appears. 

Only give me a chance to point you out the beauties ! 

Enter Mr. Bonsor from the hall. 
MR. BONSOR, encouraging. 

Ah, you're pointing out to Miss Amber the beauties ? 

PITT BRUNT. 

Even as you have pointed them out to me I 



ACT THIRD 359 

BLANCHE, at the door of the library ; with a curtsey. 

I must leave you to discuss them together ! 

Exit Blanche Amber. 
PITT BRUNT. 

She won't come out with me in the boat. 

MR. BONSOR. 

The best place to command her attention, as I instructed 
you. 

PITT BRUNT. 

I seek in vain, Mr. Bonsor, to command her attention 
or to carry out your instructions. 

MR. BONSOR. 

They seem indeed, in the light of the present crisis, to 

have been singularly futile ! (Then seeing Cubit with a telegram.) 

I tremble at every telegram ! 

Enter Cubit from the hall. 
CUBIT, as Mr. Bonsor takes the telegram from his tray. 

The ninth, sir ! 

MR. BONSOR, opening the telegram. 

The Captain reports to us from hour to hour his alter- 
nations of confidence and despair. 

PITT BRUNT. 

I hope this time it's confidence. 

MR. BONSOR, who has read. 

Despair 1

" Last hope dashed — evidently sunk to bottom." 

PITT BRUNT. 

Sunk to bottom ! That's what Miss Amber says. 

MR. BONSOR. struck. 

She admits it — she expresses it ? Then follow that up ! 

PITT BRUNT. 

In the library ? 

MR. BONSOR. 

In the boat. 

PITT BRUNT. 

But if she won't enter the boat. ? 

MR. BONSOR, after an instant.

Exit Pitt Brunt. 
MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Do you propose to carry her on board ? 



ACT THIRD 361 

MR. BONSOR. 
It may come to that ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, bjured. 

You might take a little less interest in Miss Amber's 
marriage — ! 

MR. BONSOR. 

And a little more interest in yours? I consider that 
you should make a condition. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, vague. 

For the retention of my hand ? 

MR. BONSOR, 

The success of the Captain's pursuit. He must bring 
Paul back. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

But if Paul has sunk lower than any sounding? 

MR. BONSOR. 

The Captain requires the equipment of a diver ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. decided. 

We'll have no more diving : he must come back without 
him ! Paul will have dropped to his natural level. 

MR. BONSOR. 

You allude to the supposed companion of his orgy? 
That she is his companion is after all but an hypothesis. 



362 THE REPROBATE 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

An hypothesis for which the evidence is crushing. It 
was the ground for the Captain's action — an action 
admirably prompt. 

MR. BONSOR. 

Oh yes, when the horse was stolen ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

If the horse is stolen, there are consolations. For 
really, to receive Paul — 

MR. BONSOR, as she felters. 

From the arms of such a creature ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Would cost me more than I can say ! 

MR. BONSOR. 

I would protect you by receiving him first — I would 
pump him dry. 

MRS DOUBLEDAY. 

I should feel as if he would never be dry ! 

MR. BONSOR. 

We should have doubtless more than ever, in our 
intercourse with him, to make use of the moral 
mackintosh. 

MRS. DOUDLEDAY. 

I impressed upon Captain Chanter from the first the 
necessity of such a garment. 



ACT THIRD 363 

MR. BONSOR. 
However, since he has muffed his catch — 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, with asperity. 

Why the dickens doesn't he come back? (Up at the long 
window.) I'll wire that question ! 

Exit Mrs. DoUBLEDAY. 

MR. BONSOR, alone, surprised. 
Not, I hope, in those words ! (Then as he sees Blanche : re-enter 
Blanche Amber from the library.) Mr. Brunt's gOUe withoUt yOU? 

BLANCHE. 

No, dear uncle ; he's in there. 

MR. BONSOR. 

And what's he doing ? 

BLANCHE. 

When I left him he was making a speech. 

MR. BONSOR, struck ; at the door of the library. 

On what subject ? 

BLANCHE. 

Try to make out ! 

MR. BONSOR, as he listens, with his eyes on Blanche and an admonitory 
motion. 

Hear, hear ! 

Exit rapidly Mr. Bonsor. 



364 THE REPROBATE 

BLANCHE, joyous, as she sees Paul. 

Ah, what a blessed change ! 

Enter Paul Doubleday from the hall ; with a complete ttansfonnatioa of 
appearance, expression, demeanour. He is bright, confident, assured, and 
dressed in the height of the fashion ; with flowers in his buttonhole, his 
moustache bravely curled, his high hat, of a striking diape, gallantly worn. 
He carries in his hand a magnificent bouquet, and is followed by Cubit, 
who bears an armful of parcels. 

PAUL, in high spirits. 

Dispose them on the table, Cubit, and treat them with 
respect — they're the spoils of a great campaign ! 

CUBIT. 

And what shall I give the cabman ? 

PAUL. 

Give him my blessing ! 

CUBIT. 

Tm afraid he won't go for that, sir. 

PAUL. 

If he won't go he can stay ! 

CUBIT, scandalised. 

At half-a-crown an hour ? 

PAUL. 

J stayed for less, Cubit — all those years. 

CUBIT, deprecating. 

Oh you, Mr. Paul — ! 



ACT THIRD 365 

PAUL. 
Well, I wasn't such a fool as we thought ! 

BLANCHE, who has produced her portemonnaie ; giving Cubit a coin. 

Dismiss the cab. 

CUBIT, with the money. 

And bring back the change ? 

BLANCHE. 

Keep the change. 

CUBIT, to himself. 

Seven-and-six ! 

Exit Cubit to the hall. 
PAUL, who has dashed at Blanche to kiss her hand. 

Has my absence excited remark ? 

BLANCHE. 

It has been the only subject of our conversation. 

PAUL. 

Have you mentioned, in the course of that conversation, 
the motive of my little break ? 

BLANCHE, smiling. 

How can I have mentioned it when I haven't known it ? 

PAUL, surprised. 

Didn't I make it clear — ? 



366 THE REPROBATE 

BLANCHE. 
When I rejoined you in the garden — after your fall ? 

PAUL, oblivious. 

My fall? 

BLANCHE 

Why, to the old wild life. 

PAUL, prompt, perfUnctory. 

Oh yes, the old wild life ! 

BLANCHE. 

I don't strike a man when he's down. 

PAUL. 
Certainly, I forgot I'm down ! (Offering his bouquet ; smiling.) 

And I gathered on my way down this handful of flowers. 

BLANCHE, with the bouquet. 

Flowers as wild as yourself? — flowers of folly, flowers 
of passion ? (inhaling their odour.) They're swect — but 
ought I to say so ? 

PAUL. 

Why not ? — I got them in Baker Street. (Then as Blanche 
looks disconcerted.) A jolly good shop — with an awfully 
pretty girl. 

BLANCHE, more reassured ; after an instant. 

Perhaps you had better not tell me about people of 
that sort. I don't wish to draw you out. 



ACT THIRD 367 

PAUL. 
I see. (Then after an instant.) But pcrhaps you think Tm 
worse than I am ! 

BLANCHE. 

Not worse than you were when you let everything go. 

PAUL. 

When — ^and where — did I let anything go ? 

BLANCHE. 

Why, yesterday afternoon, in the garden, as I say, when 
you finally told me you must get off by yourself. 

PAUL. 

For the first time for such an age ? 

BLANCHE. 

You declared you must go up to town. 

PAUL. 

Precisely, for a little change. 

. BLANCHE. 

You disguised your necessity under a singular expression. 

PAUL. 

I said I must take a look round ? — Well, I took a look. 

BLANCHE, prompt. 

Oh, you needn't tell me what you've seen ! 



368 THE REPROBATE 

PAUL, bringing a parcel from the table. 

I saw some bonbons in Bond Street — ^and brought you 
a btJ'x. 

BLANCHE, with the box. 

Was there a pretty girl in that shop too ? 

PAUL, laughing. 
Oh yes, two or three ! (Then showing a small parcel.) I got 

something else, you see — as a present to Mamma. 

BLANCHE. 

Well, youVe certainly made the money fly ! 

PAUL. 

All over the place ! Why shouldn't I — hang it ! — if I 
happen to feel flush ? 

BLANCHE, struck. 

Isn't that the old wild tone ? 

PAUL. 

I daresay it is, the devil take it ! 

BLANCHE, alert. 

There it is again ! 

PAUL. 

It seems as if it had come to stay, doesn't it ? 

BLANCHE. 

We mustn't let it stay any longer than it positively must. 
Remember that Tm fighting on your side. 



ACT THIRD 369 

PAUL, laughing. 

Dear Miss Amber, you're even more adorable, upon my 
word, than when you first took service under my flag ! 

BLANCHE. 

You mustn't say such things to me till youVe recovered. 

PAUL. 

That IVe recovered is precisely what's the matter with 
me ! 

BLANCHE, vague. 

Do you mean from the effects of yesterday ? 

PAUL. 

I mean from the effects of these ten years. (Reckless.) 
My dear girl, confound it, you know, I'm all right ! 

BLANCHE, disappointed. 

Already ? 

PAUL. 

Surely it has taken long enough. 

BLANCHE. 

Not long enough for me. (After an instant.) I don't care 
for saints ! There's one at me already. 

PAUL. 

The member for Blackport ? (Prompt.) Oh, I'm not so 
good as he 1 

BLANCHE. 

If you were you*d be too awful. 4

But I'm as good as — ^as good as — 

BLANCHE, challenging, while he considers 

As good as who ? 

PAUL. 

Well, as good as most men ! 

BLANCHE, disgusted. 

That's far too good 1 

PAUL, trying again. 

Then Fm as good as Captain Chanter. 

BLANCHE. 

I don't believe it! Captain Chanter's far too good. 

(Then after an instant.) If yOU'rC SO trcmcndoUSly virtUOUS, 

and you happen to feel flush, please repay me — 

PAUL. 

The money you so kindly lent me ? It was a return- 
ticket. I could neither have started nor come back 
without the pecuniary assistance you were so good as to 
render my distress; but I'm sorry to say that distress 
remains very much what it was. 

BLANCHE. 

Then how can you have felt flush ? 



ACT THIRD 371 

PAUL. 

By the purchase of hats and coats and trousers. Ready 
made — I told them to put them down. 

BLANCHE, vague. 

Down to me ? 

PAUL. 
Down to Mamma. (indicating the other objects.) Put doWH 

everythmg. 

BLANCHE, exultant. 

Then youVe gloriously in debt ! And your mother 
won't pay. 

PAUL, decided. 

Shell /uive to ! 

BLANCHE, decided. 

She shan't I 

PAUL, blank. 

Then who will ? 

BLANCHE, after an instant. 

What if /should? 

PAUL, gazing at her with surprise and emotion, then bounding to her, seizbg 
her hand, and raising it again to his lips. 

Angel ! 

Re-enter Mrs. Doublsday from the garden. 
MRS. DOUBLEDAY, arrested, amazed. 

Paul! 



372 THE REPROBATE 

PAUL, with oodistnrbed self-possesnon and good-humoar. 

I was saluting Miss Amber in the joy of my return. 
Permit me, under the influence of the same emotion, to 
extend to you^ dear Manuxia (approaching her with open annsx an 
embrace more comprehensive. 

Re-enter Mr. Bonsor fixmi the library. 

MR. BONSOR, arrested, amazed, while Mrs. Doublsday bewilderedly 
submits. 

Mrs. Doubleday ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, confounded, but bridling and indicating Blanche. 

I found him kissing her ! 

MR. BONSOR, aghast, as Pitt Brunt reappears. 

Her? 

Re-enter Pitt Brunt from the library. 
PITT BRUNT, echoing, indignant. 

Her? 

BLANCHE, exalted, audacious, passmg in front of Pitt Brunt on her 
way up left. 

Her whatl Her finger-tips ! 

PAUL, to Pitt Brunt, laughing. 

Aren't even the finger-tips more than ever you've got 
at? — How d*ye do, Mr. Bonsor? Noticed my little 
break ? — ^remarked my lucid interval ? (Then as the others 

exchange expressions of stupefaction.) Deplored it, then, bewailed 

it, felt it in the seat of sensibility ? Very charming of 
you all 1 



ACT THIRD 373 

MR. BONSOR. 
If you designate by those extraordinary terms your un- 
accountable absence, I have only to observe that, though 
it has been briefer than we apprehended, we've been 
amply occupied in considering the questions with which 
we should find ourselves confronted on its coming to an 
end. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

If it should come to an end ! 

PAUL, surprised, amtised. 

If it should? Why, what did you think I was in for? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

We didn't permit ourselves to name it ! 

[MR. BONSOR. 

You mean not to each other. 

PITT BRUNT. 

Only to hint it to a third person. 

BLANCHE, who has come down smiling, on the right. 

And yet draw the line at a fourth ! 

MR. BONSOR. 
That line, Blanche, is not yet effaced.

Did you miss the usual forms of separation ? You see 

I had to pop off. (Then* as they are again visibly startled.) To

quired those hours in town, don't you know? — ^there 
were things I had imperatively to do. But I put on a 
spurt — I managed to rush them through ! 

MR. BONSOR. 

You speak as if they had been odious necessities ! 

PAUL. 

There's no doubt, Mr. Bonsor, they were necessities, 
and distinctly urgent ones ; but, urgent as they were, it 
would indeed be wide of the mark to call them in the 
least odious. In fact the whole thing was a treat ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Paul! 

MR. BONSOR. 

Blanche! Please leave the room. (To Pitt Brunt.) He 
has really reached a point — 

PITT BRUNT. 
That embarrasses even me. (Opening the lower door on the right 

for Blanche.) Your retreat. 

PAUL, opening for her with a laugh the door of the library. 

Spare my blushes ! 

BLANCHE, between the doors a moment, then at Paul's, giving him a brush 
in the face with her bouquet. 

Reprobate I 

Exit Blanche Amber to the library. 



ACT THIRD 375 

PAUL. 
You see it was the first time for years, and there wasn't 
a single moment of it that hadn't its appreciable 

quality ! (Then while Mrs. 'Doubled ay and Mr. Bonsor indulge in mani- 
festations of increasing dismay.) Whatever delights the future 
may hold for me, I feel I never shall forget the rapture 
of those hours. Everything, in such a case, conspires 
to intensify the bliss : it's the sort of thing that, as I 
may say, don't you know ? one makes for ever one's own ! 

MR. BONSOR. 

Mrs. Doubleday, shall I face it alone? 

PITT BRUNT, springing to the lower door on the right, which he holds 
open for her. 

While you step in here ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

I think I shall suffer less if you step in there. (To Mr. 
Bonsor.) Tell him to leave us. 

PITT BRUNT, disconcerted. 

Then I'll mingle my innocence with Miss Amber's. 

PAUL, checking him with a gesture as he crosses to the library. 

My dear fellow, I wish to mingle mine 1 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

After this extraordinary exhibition of your having none ? 



376 THE REPROBATE 

PAUL, arrested, chagrined. 

Ah yes — for her! (To Pitt Brunt.) What I mean is, don't 
you know ? that I aspire to her myself. 

PITT BRUNT, to Mr. Bonsor. 

I believe he's still drunk ! 

PAUL, at the lower door on the right, which he holds open for Pitt Brunt. 

In vino Veritas — when I'm drunk I'm pressing ! 

PITT BRUNT, crossing at last to the door, where he stands again an 
instant with his eyes on Paul. 

Reprobate I 

Exit Pitt Brunt. 
PAUL. 

And where, all this while, is the dear old Captain ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, with high significance. 

That's what I should like particularly to know ! 

MR. BONSOR. 

He has not returned from London. 

PAUL, surprised. 

What's he doing in London ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

I wish you would find out ! 

MR. BONSOR. 

He went up to track you. 



ACT THIRD 377 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

But he has given you up. 

MR. BONSOR. 

Prematurely, we can't but think. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

He reports that youVe disappeared. 

MR. BONSOR. 

For ever — ^with a female. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

The same female. 

PAUL. 

The old female — Nina ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, alert. 

Is she old, Dudley ? 

PAUL. 

Dear me, yes — about your age. And she's here. 

MR. BONSOR. 

You brought her back ? 

PAUL. 

I didn't take her ! 

MR. BONSOR. 

And she didn't take you ? 



378 THE REPROBATE 

PAUL, with a gesture of repodiatuMi ; almost wounded. 

How could she ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, with deepening uneasiness. 

Then what's she here for ? 

PAUL, bethinldng himself. 

Perhaps after all she has gone. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Perhaps after all she hasn't ! You'll be so good as to 
find out 

MR BONSOR, astonished. 

You wish to throw them together ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

I wish to keep them apart ! 

PAUL, vague. 

Of whom, Mamma, do you speak ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

I speak of Captain Chanter ! 

PAUL, after an instant ; diplomatic 

There's plenty of time. — He reports that I've vanished? 

MR. BONSOR. 

He wires that you're practically extinct. 



ACT THIRD 379 

PAUL. 

Does he take me for a species — or for a volcano ? In 
the latter case I'm in lively eruption ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, suspicious. 

Why hasn't he mentioned the position of the second 
crater ? 

PAUL. 

The lady to whom we just alluded ? — ^The second crater's 

temporarily quiet. (At the table on which he caused his parcels to be 

deposited.) Such a pity the Captain's away — I've brought 
him a charming present : a couple of French novels — 
the last things out. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

And pray where have you picked up such insidious 
productions ? 

PAUL. 

In Leicester Square — such a funny little shop. 

MR. BONSOR. 

The contents of which you also appropriated — 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, as he hesitates. 

When the proprietor didn't happen to be looking ! 

PAUL, staring ; then laughing. 
You mean I bagged them ? (With two other mementoes from the 

table.) Yes, and I prigged something for each oiyou / 



38o THE REPROBATE 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, with her present, opening a small case. 

A massive bracelet ? 

MR. BONSOR, domg the same. 

And an expensive pin ? 

PAUL. 

So glad you like them ! I had them booked. 

MR. BONSOR. 

And how will you pay for them ? 

- PAUL. 
Why, as one always pays— out of income. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, triumphant. 

You haven't got any income ! 

PAUU 
I shall have a very good one when we settle. 

MR BONSOR. 

That will be ten years hence. We don't settle till 
you're forty. 

PAUL. 

My dear Mr. Bonsor, I am forty. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Since when ? You were thirty last week. 



ACT THIRD 381 

PAUL. 
So I was. But IVe grown. 

MR. BONSOR. 

Ten years — in a week ? 

PAUL. 

Ten years in an hour ! I'm of age. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, aghast 

To cease to be looked after ? 

PAUL. 

To begin to look after you, I am beginning — I have 
begun. So you'll pay me up. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

The wages of sin ? 

PAUL. 

I really think the Only sin is the sin of impertinence ! 
Don't you so much as thank me for the reward of yours ? 

MR. BONSOR 

Your mother will hardly go through such a form for an 
ornament she is incapable of retaining. She will take 
it back — 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, who has slipped the bracelet over her arm, where 

she has complacently regarded it ; after a little renunciatory wriggle 

at the clasp. 

As soon as I succeed in removing it. And Mr. Bonsor 
will only keep his pin — 



382 THE REPROBATE 

PAUL. 
To Stick into me when he*s vicious ? I warn him that 

IVe ceased to be a pin-cushion! (Withanmustrated"society- 
paper/' which he hands, open, to Mr. Bonsor.) There's Something 

just out ! — for the member for Blackport.

Putting in an hour ! 

MR. BONSOR. 

ril pass it on to Blanche. 

PAUL. 
Don't do that: it's too awfully like ! (Taking from his pocket 

asmaUpaper.) That's the figure of what I've spent 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, with the paper, in dismay, to Mr. Bonsor. I 

Seventy pounds ! I 

PAUL. 

Nine and sevenpence. I'll trouble you for a cheque. 

i 

MR. BONSOR, with the paper, after an instant, to Mrs. Doubleday. 

Will you write one ? I 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, indignant, at the window. 

Never I I 

Exit Mrs. Doubleday to the garden. 

PAUL. I 

Will you ? I 



ACT THIRD 383 

MR. BONSOR, at the lower door on the right. 

Never ! 

Exit Mr. BoNSOR. Enter Captain Chanter from the hall. 
PAUL. 

Hang it then, will you ? 

CHANTER, aghast. 

You're not off with her, as I instructed you ? 

PAUL. 

I'm no more off than she is. I'm to call on her. 

CHANTER, frantic. 

Then by all that's desperate, call 1 

PAUL. 

There's no hurry, my dear fellow. Nina won't go ! 

CHANTER. 

She'll go if you*// go. You told me so yourself! 

PAUL. 

Yes, but I won't — that's what I've an appointment to 

make her understand. (Then on a wild motion of despair of 

Chanter's.) If you thought we Aad bolted, why did you 
give chase ? 

CHANTER. 

To speed you on your way — to smother your remorse. 
You promised to save me, and I've been living in the 
blind confidence that I was saved I 



384 THE REPROBATE 

PAUL. 
You shall be if you keep your head — if you'll do exactly 
what I tell you. In the first place, you must assist me 
with Miss Amber. You must not let her find out that 
I ain't what I thought 

CHANTER. 

Nor what I thought, either ! I thought I could trust 
you! 

PAUL. 

You thought I had every vice. So did I, till I was put 
to the test. You put me to it yourself — you proved me 
utterly wanting. But it's the fond belief that I'm a 
splendid Satan that's the singular source of her interest. 

CHANTER. 

That interest is quenched, then, from the moment you 
moon about here. The way to impress her is obviously 
to do something Satanic 

PAUL. 

A good way to begin, then, will be to keep a devil of an 
eye on you. You're indispensable to my plan. 

CHANTER. 

I operate as a diversion to Mrs. Doubleday ! 

PAUL. 

If you'll direct her activity into a different channel — 



ACT THIRD 385 

CHANTER. 

You'll also find a different one for Nina's? What 
channel is there — 

PAUL. 

But the one from Dover to Calais? VWfindone^ if I 
have to dig it ! Leave me to do so. 

CHANTER, uneasy. 

With Nina all over the place ? 

PAUL. 

rm all over the place ! Do as I tell you. (Then as 

Chanter still stands reluctant ; authoritative.) Go tO yOUr rOOm J 
(Exit Captain Chanter with quick docility to the hall. Re-enter Mr. Bonsor 

by the lower door on the right.) Have you Come to tell me you 
will write the cheque ? 

MR. BONSOR. 

For half the amount — on a condition. That of your 
withdrawing your opposition — 

PAUL. 

To the Idol of the North as an active rival ? (Thinking, 
amused.) For thirty-fivc pounds ? 

MR. BONSOR. 

Four and ninepence ha'penny. Permit him regular 
access — 

PAUL. 

To the young lady he bores ? Not for the money !

386 THE REPROBATE 

MR. BONSOR. disappointed. 

Then on what terms can we arrange it ? 

PAUL, up at the door to the hall as Blanche re-appears. 

Ask the young lady herself ! 

Exit Paul Doubleday. Re-enter Blanche Amber from the library. 
BLANCHE, with her bouquet. 

I must delay no longer to put my flowers into water. 

MR. BONSOR. 

I beg you to come back then as soon as you've supplied 
them with a sustenance of which I decline to regard 
them as deserving. The member for Blackport — 

• BLANCHE. 

What on earth does he want now ? 

MR. BONSOR. 

What youVe never yet frankly given him — the chance 
to catch your eye. 

BLANCHE. 

Dear uncle, I'm not the Speaker ! 

MR. BONSOR. 

He'll make you feel like the House itself. And when 
the House divides — 

BLANCHE, laughing. 
I shall be in the right lobby ! (Then as she sees Pitt Brunt : 
re-enter Pitt Brunt by the lower door on the right.) I'll be back ! 

Exit Blanche Amber by the lower door on the right. 



ACT THIRD 387 

PITT BRUNT, anxious. 

And where*!! ^ be ? 

MR. BONSOR. 

It wil! be impossible henceforth to calculate with any 
exactness. Hitherto weVe done it to a second. 

PITT BRUNT, aggrieved. 

You should really have taken him in hand ! 

MR. BONSOR. 

The way to begin was by taking that woman. 

PITT BRUNT, after a moment. 

That may possibly be the way to end ! 

MR. BONSOR, struck. 

It might be — all the more that she's somewhere about. 
(After an instant.) I suppose her attractions are pronounced. 

PITT BRUNT, prompt. 

Very easily, with a little practice ! 

MR. BONSOR, surprised. 

Then youVe seen her? 

PITT BRUNT, on his guard. 

Not to know it was she ! But if she's somewhere about, 
her confederate must also be. 



388 THE REPROBATE 

MR BONSOR. at the lower door on the right. 

Thank heaven, he can't be in two places at once ! 

Exit Bir. BoNSOR. 
PITT BRUNT, alone. 
My only comfort I (Then thinking, bewildered.) Yet hc 

behaves as if he wanted them both ! 

Re-enter Cubit from the hall. 
CUBIT, announcing. 

Mrs. Freshville ! 

-Enter Mrs. Freshville. Exit Cubit. 
MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

You here still ? How d'ye do to-day ? 

PITT BRUNT. 

I never feel quite fit when I haven't put in my hour. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

I've come to put in mine — I'm tired of messing about 

PITT BRUNT. 

I heard just now you were messing — 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. amazed. 

The man has the cheek to mention it ? 

PITT BRUNT. 

Oh no, he doesn't mention it — but the whole thing's 
• known. 



ACT THIRD 389 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, alert. 

Then how does the woman take it ? 

PITT BRUNT, deprecating. 

She's scarcely a woman — ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, impatient. 

I know — she's a monster ! What does she make of it ? 

PITT BRUNT. 

You're severe ! But she doesn't make quite so much of 
it as you might expect. She takes it rather easy. In 
fact you might suppose she almost likes it ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, astounded. 

Likes his goings on with me ? 

PITT BRUNT. 

Then they've been as bad as we all suppose ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

They've been beyond everything that ever was ! (With 
renewed stupefaction.) She Hkes his being engaged to another 
woman ? 

PITT BRUNT, surprised. 

Do you mean to say he's literally engaged? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

As much as a man ever was in the world. Engaged up 
to his eyes— engaged down to his boots ! 



390 THE REPROBATE 

PITT BRUNT. 
Happily I don't think she knows that ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Then I shall have the pleasure of telling her ! 

PITT BRUNT. 

I daresay it will produce some effect. She doesn't mind 
anything except that 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Except marriage — or the next thing to it? And she 
calls herself a respectable woman ? 

PITT BRUNT, wincing ; after an instant. 

I'm bound to say she's very hard to shock, 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Put it Stronger. She's a monster of what-do-you-call-it ! 

PITT BRUNT, at a loss. 

Do you call it paradox ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

I call it immorality ! But wasn't I jolly right to come ! 

PITT BRUNT. 

Do you argue that he'll see you ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Not if he can help it ! But I argue that I'm perfectly 
visible. Where do you suppose he is ? 



ACT THIRD 391 

PITT BRUNT, looking at his watch ; melancholy. 

I'm afraid he's somewhere with her, 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Don't take it harder than / do I (After an instant.) Could 
you bring us together ? 

PITT BRUNT, vague. 

You and him ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Me and her. 

PITT BRUNT, disconcerted. 

Dear no — not that ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Well, you needn't scratch my eyes out ! (Holding up several 
of Chanter's letters.) It wiU do quite as Well to hand her 
these. His letters — nine of 'em — breathing every vow. 

PITT BRUNT, with the letters; alert. 

Vows of passion — vows of marriage ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Vows of everything on earth — and every vow a lie. 
Poke 'em in her face. 

PITT BRUNT, intensely eager. 

I'll poke 'em ! But how can I ever thank you ? 



39a THE REPROBATE 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Thank me for nothing ! I didn't do it for you I (Then as 

Cubit reappears : re-enter Cubit from the hall.) That Way ? 
PITT BRUNT, surprised. 

You're going off? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Tm going on. (Up at the door to the hall.) Work her up ! 

Exeunt Mrs. Freshvillb and Cubit to the hall. 
PITT BRUNT, as Blanche reappears. 

I'll work her up ! 

Re-enter Blanche Amber by the lower door on the right 
BLANCHE. 

My uncle has just told me you wish to catch my eye. 

PITT BRUNT. 

In order to direct it, Miss Amber, to unprecedented 
documents. 

BLANCHE, smiling. 

Parliamentary papers ? 

PITT BRUNT. 
Not exactly Blue Books ! (Giving her Mrs. Freshville's letters.) 

I place them in your hands. 

BLANCHE, with the letters, vague. 

You mean I'm to look them through? But they're 

letters they're private. (Then after hastily glancing at a word here 

and there.) They're all about love ! 



ACT THIRD 393 

PITT BRUNT. 
The/re all about marriage — you'll easily see ! 

BLANCHE. 

I don't want to see — especially if they're yours ? 

PITT BRUNT. 

How can you think they're mine when you know my 
hand ? 

BLANCHE, with a look at the letters again. 

Yes — ^it's a better hand than yours ! (Then suddenly tossing 
them down.) But I ncvcr read such stuff ! 

PITT BRUNT. 

They may well bring the blush. to your cheek, but I 
regret to be obliged to deepen it! — You haven't seen 
that writing? 

BLANCHE, with a letter that is out of its envelope, trying ineffectually to 
remember, then suddenly catching sight of something. 

Oh yes, I recall a name ! 

PITT BRUNT, exultant. 

May I inquire what name ? 

BLANCHE. 

The name that was on his photograph. 

PITT BRUNT, struck. 

He has given you his photograph ? 



394 THE REPROBATE 

BLANCHE. 
Oh yes. That is he hasn't ! 

PITT BRUNT. 

But you recognbe the writer ? 



Mr. Paul? 
Mr. Paul !

Dudley? 



BLANCHE, troubled, uncertain. 

PITT BRUNT, triumphant. 

BLANCHE, with emotion, thinking. 

PITT BRUNT, vague. 



BLANCHE, after another glance at the open letters. 

It's the pet name. " To his Nina " ! 

PITT BRUNT, at the door of the library; impressive. 

Say, Madam, to his miserable victim ! 

Exit Pitt Brunt. 
BLANCHE, alone, agitated. 

He makes victims — and makes them miserable ? (Hastily 

gathering the letters together.) . Who should knOW it better 

than I? — But what has Mr. Brunt to do with these 
things — how did he ever get them ? He gave them to 
me as a warning ? (After an instant.) Miserable as I am, I 
reject the warning ! I'll give them back to the writer ! 

(Then as she sees Paul and instinctively puts the letters behind her.) Oh, 

Mr. Paul, you're just the man — ! 



ACT THIRD 395 

Re-enter Paul Doubleday from the hall, in an elaborate change of costume. 
PAUL, anxious, flurried. 

YouVe just the woman, Miss Amber, but I^m trying to 
track the Captain. IVe something special to say to him. 

Re-enter Captain Chanter from the hall. 
CHANTER, to Paul. 

IVe just seen Cubit — he tells me you want me. 

BLANCHE, at the lower door on the right, to Paul, smiling. 

Then you don't want me I 

Exit Blanche Amber with the letters. 
PAUL, breathless. 

Mamma knows all — she has your letters ! 

CHANTER, appalled. 

Nina has been here ? 

PAUL. 

She is here — in my retreat. 

CHANTER, astonished. 

YouVe got one ? 

PAUL. 

The Chinese room — IVe taken it. She arrived — fear- 
fully out of patience — as I was on the very point of 
going to her, and I thought it best to have her right in. 
But she had already passed in the letters. She proclaims 
her vengeance on you as successfully accomplished, and 



396 THE REPROBATE 

I left her there gloating over it to come and warn you. 
The faf s on the fire — but I told her I can't oblige her. 

CHANTER, rueful, resentftil. 

You can't oblige anybody ! So what the mischief is she 

waiting for ? 

PAUL. 

For her photograph — I mean for mine. You broke 
your promise to carry it to her, and she declines to leave 
the house without it 

CHANTER. 

How could I carry it to her when I couldn't find it ? 

PAUL, looking blankly about. 

I'm in exactly the same predicament ! 

CHANTER, helpless, hopeless. 

So she's here for the rest of our lives ? 

PAUL, as Mrs. Doubleday reappears. 

I'm terribly afraid not ! 

Re-enter Mrs. Doubleday from the garden. Instantly astonished by the 
presence of Chanter, she hurries down toward him ; then, between the two 
men,'stopping short, looks with sudden wonderment and suspicion from one 
of them to the other. 

CHANTER, embarrassed, confused, but trying to meet her. 

Dearest friend ! 



MRS. DOUBLEDAY, retaining, with resentment and severity, possession 
of the hand he tries to kiss. 

Your dearest friend has come to get you ! (Then as Chanter 



ACT THIRD 397 

exchanges with Paul a look of confirmed dismay.) YoU grOSSly dCSCrt 

your dearest friend ! 

CHANTER, collapsing, pleading. 

I know that my conduct has been dreadful — ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 
I must clear it up with you. (indicating the garden.) I'vC 

been perched there on the lookout. 

PAUL. 

His arrival happened to escape your notice — it has just 
taken place. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Long enough ago for me to remark that his first impulse 
has not been the impulse to fly to me. 

PAUL. 

He was in the very act of spreading his wings ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

It has come home to me since your own return that he 

spread them very wide in town. (Then to Chanter, while he 
exchanges with Paul another woeful regard.) YoU SCC the Condition 

in which your pupil has reappeared? Your responsi- 
bilities sit very light ! 

PAUL. 

He has just been explaining to me that he has every 
intention to meet them. 



398 THE REPROBATE 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

They have increased tremendously this morning, and he 
shall presently hear from me on the subject. In the 
meantime he'll go to my room and ask my maid for a 
precious packet, conspicuous on the mantel-piece, sealed 
with large red seals and containing papers of grave 

importance. (To Chanter, who stands bewildered while Paul goes up 

in agitation.) You'll take them straight to my boudoir, and 
we'll go through them together. (With high resolution.) We'll 
have it right over 1 

CHANTER, Ungering, paralysed. 

I see what you mean ! 

PAUL, coming down again, with irrepressible authority. 

Then march ! 

Exit Chanter, startled, with a rush of desperation, to the hall. 
MR&amp; DOUBLEDAY, who has massively seated herself. 

What did you remark to him ? 

PAUL, familiar, gay. 

I remarked, my dear lady, that there's no resisting you ; 
and there evidently isn't, unless a fellow's like me. But, 
you know, I'm adamant, whereas the Captain's all fiddle- 
strings and moonbeams. (Then as she stares, astounded at his new 

tone.) There's one thing, however, you know — you 
mustn't, as I may say, presume^ you mustn't stake every- 
thing, on the force — or, as you would perhaps yourself 
prefer to call it, the charm — of your certainly remarkable 
personality. You'll tell me it has seen you through often 



ACT THIRD 399 

enough to show you how far you can go; and I fully 
recognise that time has given it those comfortable curves, 
those generous gradients over which the railroad of social 
intercourse may be laid at an expense not incompatible 
with the hope that it will pay. You can go a certain 
length, Mamma, you can achieve certain runs — but you 
can't make the time you did ! A road may be well kept 
up, but if you go in for heavy traffic you must lay your 
iccount with a smash. Don't therefore, as I say, don't 
magnify small accidents. Don't cry out about a collision 
when there has only been a casual bump! (Laughing, 
flattering.) Your casual bumps, Mamma, certainly oughtn't 
to bruise ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, rising in stupefaction. 

You take advantage, sir, of the absence of the few pro- 
tectors I possess — ! 

PAUL, good-humoured, imperturbable. 

Only to enjoin upon you not to make too much of such 
things. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, after an instant. 

Of what things, I beg to know, are you indecent enough 
to speak ? 

PAUL. 

Why, for instance, of those trashy papers. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Pray, do you take into account their authorship ? 



400 THE REPROBATE 

PAUL. 
It's just their authorship that makes them mere hyper- 
bole! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, after another moment. 

Will you be so good as to tell me what you're talking 
about ? 

PAUL, surprised. 

The letters you sent the Captain for. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

What's your reason for calling them letters ? 

PAUL, checked, embarrassed. 

I don't insist on the name. Outbursts of momentary 
ardour. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, very alert. 

Then / insist on the name! — What abyss have you 
unguardedly opened ? 

PAUL, after an instant. 

What are the papers you are to go over with the Captain ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Instructions from the late Mr. Doubleday — drawn up in 
view of the contingency which has now presented itself. 

PAUL. 

That of your chucking up his son ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

That of your " chucking up " his widow ! 



ACT THIRD 401 

PAUL, amused. 

Something seems to tell me the instructions are 
voluminous ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

I've every confidence. But it's a mystery I've always 
respected. The large red seals are intact. 

PAUL. 

And you propose to delegate to the Captain the office 
of breaking them ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

After first assuring myself that he is really worthy of it. 

(Then after an instant, abrupt, distressfully appealing, with a complete change 

oftonc and manner.) Paul — ts he really worthy ? 

PAUL, laughing. 

Doesn't it strike you I'm an extraordinary person to ask ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

You're the person who knows most about such things. 

PAUL. 

Let me inquire in turn what things you're talking about. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

The horrible things men do. You've betrayed him — 
and he has betrayed himself. 

PAUL. 

I've never betrayed anybody, and I can promise you I 
never will ! We'll respect the mystery of the late Mr.

Doubleday's instructions — we'll keep our hands from 
the large red seals.

You practically proclaim, then, that the Captain's are

up his arms in embarrassed repudiation.) 1*11 draW yOU a chcqUC

The real truth ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, ardent. 

The whole truth ! 

PAUL, after another moment. 

Not for the money ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, indignant, flouncing off. 

I'll get it from him ! 

Exit Mrs. DOUBLEDAY to the hall. 

PAUL, alone, disconcerted. 
She'll break with him ! (Then, alarmed, as Mr. Bonsor reappears : 
re-enter Mr. Bonsor by the lower door on the right.) Mr. BonSOr, wUl 

she break with him ? 



ACT THIRD 403 

MR. BONSOR. 

My ungovernable niece ? I^m sorry to have to recognise 
that she has already practically done so. She has 
levelled against my young friend an accusation under 
the effect of which I have fairly staggered from her 
presence — an accusation of conduct — 

PAUL, as he can't bring it out. 

Unparliamentary ? What has he done ? 

MR. BONSOR. 
I am just looking for him to inquire. (Then as he sees 

Chanter : re-enter Captain Chanter from the garden.) Have yOU Secn 

the member for Blackport ? 

CHANTER. 
He's in the garden. (Agitated, blanched, to Paul as Mr. Bonsor 

goes up.) I can't do it ! 

PAUL. 

She hasn't got them ! 

Re-enter Mrs. Doubleday from the hall. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, with a large sealed packet and with energy, as 
Chanter moves quickly away from Paul and she sees Mr. Bonsor going. 

Mr. Bonsor ! (Then as he obediently comes down with her.) Be 

present ! That's more, apparently, than Captain 
Chanter had courage to be ! 

PAUL. 

Dear Mamma, he has come back for you. 



404 THE REPROBATE 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 
I've come back for him I (Then having looked hard from one of 
them to the other ; holding out her packet to Chanter.) Break thoSC 

seals ! (To Mr. BoNsoR.) The instructions. 

MR. BONSOR. 

A new lot ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

For the new crisis. The supreme measures. 

MR. BONSOR, complacent. 

Our second line of defence ! 

PAUL. 

Abandon, Captain, your second line. We'll dispense 

with the supreme measures. (Then as Chanter stares.) 

Touch the seals at your peril. Give me the packet 

CHANTER, with his packet ; tormented, perplexed, to Mrs. Doubleday. 

What will be the penalty, love, of my surrendering my 
precious charge ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

The inevitable inference that you have reasons for 

grovelling before your pupil. (After an instant ; formidable.) 

He has seen the fatal letters. 

MR. BONSOR, blank but prompt. 

Where are they to be seen ? 



ACT THIRD 40s 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

That's exactly what I want to know ! Paul doesn't 
deny the impeachment. 

CHANTER, scandalised, tossing his packet to a table. 

Then I call upon him instantly to do so. (To Paul.) 
What letters does your mother mean ? 

PAUL, after a moment. 
I let the cat out of the bag ! (Then as Pitt Brunt reappears.) 

The fatal letters exist ! 

Re-enter Pitt Brunt from the garden. 
PITT BRUNT, struck, coming quickly down as Blanche reappears. 

The fatal letters exist ! 

Re-enter Blanche Amber by the lower door on the right. 
CHANTER, amazed, to Pitt Brunt. 

How the devil, sir, do you know ? 

PITT BRUNT, arrested, conciliatory. 

I hasten to explain, sir, that I don't attribute them to 
you ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, astonished. 

Then to whom in the world do you attribute them ? 

BLANCHE, precipitate, very loud. 

Ahem ! 



406 THE REPROBATE 

PAUL, while the others stare in surprise at her ambiguous ejaculation. 

I'll save Mr. firunt the trouble of saying. (After a moment.) 
The fatal letters are mine ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, blank. 

Then who in the world has them ? 

BLANCHE, passing close to Pitt Brunt ; privately, with ferocity. 

Say at your peril I 

PAUL, to Mrs. DoUBLEDAY. 

I thought they had come into your hands. (Then indicating 
Chanter.) Take him away to beg his pardon. 

CHANTER, to Mrs. Doubled ay, smiling. 

Naughty doubting dear ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, breathing again, but severe. 

Naughty frightening man ! 

PAUL, impatient ; motioning them off. 

Oh, make it up somewhere else ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, startled, giving ground, but hesitating. 

Without the instructions ? 

PAUL. 

You evidently require no teaching ! (Then highly authoritative.) 
Go! 



ACT THIRD 407 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, who has hurried up ; to Chanter, at the door 
to the hall. 

Come ! 

Exit Mrs. DOUBLEDAY. 

CHANTER, uneasy ; privately to Paul. 

But the letters ? 

PAUL. 

I'll find them ! 

CHANTER, up at the door to the hall ; aloud. 

Reprobate ! 

Exit Captain Chanter. 

PAUL, at the left ; peremptory, to Mr. Bonsor and Pitt Brunt, who have 
been conversing down at the right. 

Leave me alone with Miss Amber ! 

BLANCHE. 

I require to be alone with Mr. Paul. 

MR. BONSOR. 

You will neither of you have forgotten that / wish to be 
alone — 

PAUL. 

With the member for Blackport ? So do // But I'll 
take him later. 

PITT BRUNT. 

I shall suffer nothing to blind me to the fact that I have 
still my hour to put in. 



4o8 THE REPROBATE 

MR. BONSOR. 
On the water? You can take .me out — I'll join you 

directly in the garden. (Then to Paul, while Pitt Brunt, intensely 
preoccupied, approaches Blanche.) Reprobate ! 

Exit Mr. BoMSOR to the hall. 

PITT BRUNT, to Blanche. 

You accept the shocking evidence ? 

BLANCHE. . . 

Of an existing connection ? — I accept everything ! 

PITT BRUNT, up at the window, scandalised. 

I call it immorality ! 

Exit Pitt Brunt to the garden. 
BLANCHE, to Paul. 

I daresay it is ; but I forgive you. 

PAUL, vague. 

For saying such a thing ? 

BLANCHE. 

For doing it ! / have the letters ! 

PAUL, amazed. 

How in the world — ? 

BLANCHE. 

In my room — from Mr. Brunt. 



ACT THIRD 409 

PAUL, bewildered. 

How did Mr. Brunt get them ? 

BLANCHE. 

I give it up ! But I'm keeping them for you. 

PAUL, anxious. 

Don't " keep " them — bring them to me ! (Then checking her 
as she is going.) But there's Something you can keep for me. 

(Placing in her hands the sealed packet.) Keep this ! 

BLANCHE, with the packet, exalted, at the lower door on the right. 

To the death ! 

Exit Blanche Amber. Re-enter Mrs. Freshville from the hajl. 
PAUL, nervous, curt. 

I've been too busy to come back to you — and I'm too 
busy to converse with you now ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

You're a very superior person, Dud; but you can be 
awfully nasty when you like. You know I've declined 
to leave the house without that memento — doubly dear 
to me now — of our brighter and happier hours. Your 
precious photo has been appropriated, and after very 
patiently and very vainly waiting there for you to recover 
it for me, I demand here the production of my property. 

PAUL. 

Accept as a substitute, my dear Nina, the assurance 
that I'll be taken again ! 



410 THE REPROBATE 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

What I desire, Dudley, is the representation of your 
more juvenile and — since you force me to say so — your 
more attractive personality. 

PAUL, alanned, as Pitt Brunt reappears. 

Don't bring it up — there's some one there ! 

Re-enter Pitt Brunt from the garden. 
MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

You gave her the letters ? 

PITT BRUNT, embarrassed. 

She has them in her hands. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

And what does she say about the shocking evidence — 

PITT BRUNT. 

Of an existing connection ? She accepts it. She accepts 
everything ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, stupefied. 

Everything ? Then she's a cat ! 

PITT BRUNT, emphatic. 

She's a cat ! 

PAUL, smiling. 

No — she's only a woman in love ! (To PittBrunt, who stands 
blank.) Have you come back for something ? 



ACT THIRD 4" 

PITT BRUNT. 
For Mr. Bonsor — to put in my hour. 

PAUL. 
I daresay he's dressing. (Then with a happy thought ; inspired.) 

Put it in with Mrs. Freshville ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, struck. 

On the river — the dear old river ? 

PITT BRUNT, struck. 

I put in an hour each day. (After an instant, engaging.) Could 
you give me as much as that ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, looking from Pitt Brunt to Paul. 

By-bye? 

PAUL. 

By-bye ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, giving her reticule to Pitt Brunt. 

Stick it in the boat. 

PITT BRUNT, alert, with the reticule ; up at the window, to Paul. 

Patch it up with Mr. Bonsor ! 

Exit Pitt Brunt to the garden. 
MRS. FRESHVILLE, after a moment ; thoughtful. 

Not engaged ? 

PAUL. 

I can answer for that ! 



412 THE REPROBATE 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Much of a swell ? 

PAUL, handmg her from the table the copy of the " society-paper." 

The papers are full of him. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, with the cartoon. 

" The Idol of the North " I 

PAUL. 

The young man of the hour. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

More than ever you were ! By-bye. 

PAUL. 
By-bye. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, with the copy of the paper under her arm ; up 
at the window, contemptuous, sarcastic. 

Perfection ! 

Exit Mrs. FRESHVILLE to the garden 
Re-enter Captain Chanter from the hall. 
CHANTER, anxious. 

Has she gone ? 

PAUL, coming down from the window, indicating the garden, while Chanter, 
interrogative, goes up, and Blanche and Mr. Bonsor reappear. 



She has found an opening ! 



ACT THIRD 413 

Re-enter Blanche Amber by the lower door on the right. Re-enter Mr. 
BoNSOR, in boating costume, from the hall. 

BLANCHE, with Mrs. Freshville's letters, eager, to Paul. 

Here are the letters ! 

CHANTER, struck, turning, bounding down to grab them. 

Mine ! 

PAUL, smiling, having seized them first. 

Mine ! 

CHANTER, to Blanche, resentful. 

You should have given them to me ! 

BLANCHE. 

They belong to the writer. 

CHANTER. 

He's not the writer ! 

BLANCHE, aghast, to Paul. 

You're not the writer? 

PAUL. 

I blush to confess it — Pm so much less bad than you 
want me ! 

CHANTER. 

He took them on himself to save his friend. 

BLANCHE, struck, eager. 

He told a glorious lie ? 

PAUL, laughing, while he tosses Chanter the packet of letters. 

Don't mention it ! 



414 THE REPROBATE 

BLANCHE, overjoyed. 

But I don't want you any worse than that! 

MR. BONSOR, to Chanter. 

Are you very sure his friend is saved ? 

PAUL. 

Not if you basely blab, Mr. Bonsor. 

CHANTER, confident, complacent. 

Oh, he may basely blab ! (After an instant.) Fm sure ! 

MR. BONSOR, to Blanche. 

But where did you get them ? 

BLANCHE. 

From the member for Blackport. 

MR. BONSOR, blank. 

And where did he get them ? 

PAUL. 

From the lady to whom they were addressed. 

MR. BONSOR, startled. 

Nina — the unspeakable Nina? (indignant.) He never 
went near her ! 

PAUL. 

He's remarkably near her now — he's out on the river 
with her ! 



ACT THIRD 415 

MR. BONSOR, stupefied. 

Then it was for him the woman came ? 

PAUL. 

She came for a certain photograph ! 

MR. BONSOR, struck. 

I remember ! (Looking ineflfectuaiiy round.) What on earth 
became of it ? 

BLANCHE, producing it from her pocket. 

Here it is ! 

MR. BONSOR, to the others, amazed. 

She had it all the while ? 

BLANCHE, embarrassed, hesitating. 

I took it because — because — 

PAUL, radiant. 

You must keep the reason for me t 

BLANCHE. 
May I tell him, uncle ? 

MR. BONSOR. 

Tell him what you like ! (Then looking at her a moment in be- 
wildered abstraction, raising and dropping his arms at his sides in helpless and 
humiliated renunciation and going up.) The Idol of the Nofth ! 

PAUL, ardent, triumphant, with his two hands out. 

Blanche ! 



4l6 THE REPROBATE 

BLANCHE, meeting him in happy freedom while he takes both her hands and 
respectfully kisses them. 

Paul ! 

Re-enter Mrs. Doublbday from the hall. 
MRS. DOUBLEDAY, startled, instinctive, loud, as before. 

Paul ! 

CHANTER, eager, as the others, absorbed, pay no attention. 
It's all right ! (Then, irresistible, as Mrs. Doubleday surrenders herself 
to his endearment.) Beloved ! 

PAUL, suddenly observing, good-naturedly but loudly and ominously warning, 
while Mrs. Doubleday gives a violent start. 

Mamma ! 



THE END
