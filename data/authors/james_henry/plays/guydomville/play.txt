GUY DOMVILLE 



ACT FIRST 

The garden of an old house in the West of 
England; the portion directly behind the house, 
away from the public approach. Towards the centre 
a flat old-fashioned stone slab, on a pedestal, formed 
like a table and constituting a sun-dial. Close to 
it a garden-seat. On the right a low wooden gate, 
leading to another part of the grounds. On the left 
a high garden wall with a green door. A portion of 
the house is visible at the back, with a doorway, a 
porch and a short flight of steps. A waning June 
afternoon. Enter Frank Humber, by the wooden 
gate. Enter Fanny from the house. 

Fanny. You're wanted, sir! Excuse me, sir; I 
thought you were Mr. Domville. 

Frank. Isn't Mr. Domville in the house? 

Fanny. No indeed, sir: I came out to look for 
him. 

Frank. He's not that way: I left my horse at the 
stable, where, I may mention, I had to put him up 
myself. 

Fanny. I'm not afraid of beasts, sir, and if I had 
been there I would have taken hold of him. Peter's 
away with my mistress. 

Frank. And where has your mistress gone? 

Fanny. Over to Taunton — in the old green gig.

126 Guy Domville 

Frank. A plague on the old green gig! I've ridden 
five miles to see her. 

Fanny. You often do that, sir! 

Frank. Not half so often as I want! 

Fanny. We all know at Porches what you want, 
sir! {Sympathetically.) She'll come back to you! 

Frank. It was just in that hope I rode over! 

Fanny. (With a laugh.) Oh, I mean back from 
Taunton! 

Frank. I trust so — if the gig holds out! And who 
is it then wants Mr. Domville? 

Fanny. It is my mistress that mostly wants him, 
sir! — she sends me for him to this place and that. 
But at present he happens to have a different call. 
This visitor! 

(Enter Lord Devenish from the house.) 

Frank. Leave me with him! 

Fanny. (With a curtsey to Lord Devenish.) I'll 
try the pond — or the river, sir! (Exit by the green 
door.) 

Lord Devenish. Does she mean to drag 'em? I 
hope he ain't drowned! 

Frank. My friend Mr. Domville has the habit of 
fishing, sir. 

Lord Devenish. The most innocent of pleasures 
— yet perhaps the most absorbing! In Mr. Domville's 
apparent absence I rejoice to find myself introduced 
to one of his friends. 

Frank. May I inquire if you also enjoy that title? 

Lord Devenish. I hope to win it, sir! I've trav- 
elled for the purpose all the way from London! 
My business with Mr. Domville is urgent — so urgent 
that while impatiently waiting, just now, till he 
should be summoned, I ventured to step out of the 
house in the hope of meeting him the sooner. 

Frank. Under the impression that he lives at 
Porches? 

Lord Devenish. That impression has already been 



Act First 127 

corrected. A modest habitation in the village was 
pointed out to me on my arrival. 

Frank. Mr. Domville's humble lodging — at the 
baker's. 

Lord Devenish. I smelt the warm bread a mile 
off! I had the privilege of an interview with the 
baker's wife, and it was in consequence of the in- 
formation she gave me that I knocked without 
delay at this door. 

Frank. Mr. Domville spends most of his time 
here. 

Lord Devenish. A charming place — to spend most 
of one's time! 

Frank. That depends on what one spends it in! 

Lord Devenish. Mine must all go to business — 
business of marked importance. 

Frank. A matter, evidently, of life and death! 

Lord Devenish. You may judge, sir, that I haven't 
posted night and day for a trifle! I learned from the 
baker's wife that Mr. Domville does come home to 
bed: but the nature of my errand forbade me to 
wait till he should happen to be sleepy. I stand 
engaged, moreover, not to let Mr. Domville slip. 

Frank. I may let you know, then, that you've 
arrived in the nick of time! He goes to-morrow. 

Lord Devenish. (Startled.) Goes where? 

Frank. Into retreat, as we Catholics call it. 

Lord Devenish. (Raising his hat) The true and 
only Church! 

Frank. (Gratified.) You're one of us, sir? 

Lord Devenish. The blackest sheep in the fold! 

Frank. The fold here is very small. But we're 
protected by my Lord Edenbrook. 

Lord Devenish. He provides, I know, for your 
spiritual nourishment. 

Frank. His private chapel, his worthy chaplain, 
are precious comforts to us. 

Lord Devenish. The centre, of course, of your 



is8 Guy Domville 

little cluster of the faithful. Why then should Mr. 
Domville forsake such privileges? 

Frank. For the sake of others that are greater. To 
enter a religious house. 

Lord Devenish. As a preparation for holy orders? 

Frank. The time for his ordination has at last 
come. He starts in the morning for Bristol. 

Lord Devenish. Thank God, then, I swore at the 
postboys! He takes ship for France? 

Frank. For Douai and the good Fathers who 
brought him up, and who tried, heaven reward 
them! to do the same by me! 

Lord Devenish. The Benedictines? You were both 
at school with them? 

Frank. A part of the time together. But I'm not 
of the stuff of which churchmen are made! 

Lord Devenish. And you consider that Mr. Dom- 
ville is? 

Frank. It's not I — it's everyone. He has what they 
call the vocation. 

Lord Devenish. Then have I come too late? (Re- 
enter Fanny from the green door.) Can't you find 
him? 

Fanny. Not by the water, sir. But the dairy-maid 
has seen him: he's gone to walk with the little 
master. 

Frank. The little master's the little pupil. 

Lord Devenish. Mrs. Peverel's son? 

Frank. Her only one — poor little fatherless imp! 
Guy Domville, recommended to her by Lord Eden- 
brook's chaplain, has had for the last year the 
happiness of being his tutor. Thank you, Fanny. 
We'll wait. 

(Exit Fanny to the house.) 

Lord Devenish. Your own preference, sir, is to 
stay? 

Frank. Assuredly — when I've ridden five miles 
to take leave of him. 



Act First 129 

Lord Devenish. At so private an interview with 
so old a friend my presence will perhaps be indis- 
creet. May I therefore ask you to be so good as to 
make it clear to him that I await him impatiently 
at the inn? 

Frank. I shall be able to make it clearer if I'm 
permitted to mention your name. 

Lord Devenish. (Drawing from the breast of his 
waistcoat a letter without a seal.) My name is on 
this letter, which expresses the importance of my 
mission and which I have been requested to place 
in his hand. He will receive it, however, with 
deeper concern from yours. 

Frank. (With the letter.) He shall have it as 
soon as he returns. (Indicating the wooden gate.) 
That's the short way to the village. 

Lord Devenish. Before I go may I ask you an- 
other? Is Mrs. Peverel of the Sussex Peverels? 

Frank. Her late husband was of that famly. She's 
a niece of my Lord Edenbrook. 

Lord Devenish. Very good blood! And a widow 
of some — antiquity? 

Frank. Antiquity? Why she's just my age! 

Lord Devenish. (Laughing.) The very flower 
of youth! — And very charming? 

Frank. Judge for yourself, sir! 

(Enter Mrs. Peverel from the house. Lord 
Devenish, removing his hat, remains a 
moment meeting her eyes while she returns 
his look. Then he makes a ceremonious 
bow and goes out by the wooden gate.) 

Mrs. Peverel. (Surprised.) What does the gen- 
tleman desire? 

Frank. To have speech of our young divine. 

Mrs. Peverel. Pray, who is he? 

Frank. I believe that letter tells. 

Mrs. Peverel. (With the letter.) "For Mr. Dom- 
ville, introducing my Lord Devenish." 



130 Guy Domville 

Frank. (Surprised.) My Lord Devenish? 

Mrs. Peverel. (Wondering.) Isn't that the name 
— the name — ? 

Frank. The name of a nobleman of extraordinary 
assurance! 

Mrs. Peverel. That's just what I mean — the one 
who was said to be Mrs. Domville's great adorer. 

Frank. Do you mean the lady's lover? I never 
knew any Mrs. Domville but the mother of our 
good friend. 

Mrs. Peverel. I speak of the widow of one of his 
kinsmen — the one that was the head of the family. 

Frank. (Smiling.) He's not the head of ours! God 
bless you for such a letter! 

Mrs. Peverel. (Turning over Lord Devenish's 
letter.) It's not sealed, you see. (Absent.) What 
does he want of Mr. Domville? 

Frank. I don't mean that one — I mean yours, 
that came yesterday. You see it has brought me 
over. 

Mrs. Peverel. Didn't you come over to see your 
friend? 

Frank. You're my friend, and when I come to 
your house you're always the person I come fort 
Especially when you let me know that you desire 
it. 

Mrs. Peverel. (Surprised.) Is that what my letter 
conveyed? 

Frank. It conveyed that I might ride over if I 
liked — which comes to the same thing. And it con- 
veyed some other things. Have you already for- 
gotten? 

Mrs. Peverel. I don't remember — I'm miserably 
sad. We're losing our best company. 

Frank. Dear lady, it's you who are mine, and I 
haven't lost you yet! 

Mrs. Peverel. You haven't yet gained me, Mr. 
Humber! 



Act First 131 

Frank. What then did your letter mean? 

Mrs. Peverel. I don't know what it meant! I'll 
tell you some other time! 

Frank. Thank you for that. I assure you I look 
forward to other times. 

Mrs. Peverel. Oh, we shall have leisure! It 
stretches out like the Great Desert! The cruel loss 
will be Geordie's. He parts with his comrade — with 
his idol! 

Frank. The child loves him so? 

Mrs. Peverel. Loves him? He clings to him — he's 
spending his last hour with him! Such devotion as 
my boy has enjoyed and such perfect tenderness — 
such an influence and such an example! And now it 
all goes! 

Frank. It goes to a greater work! 

Mrs. Peverel. (Musing, with a vague shrug) 
Yes, yes — a greater work! 

Frank. He'll rise to high honours — be one of the 
Princes of the Church. 

Mrs. Peverel. I don't know if he'll be one of its 
"Princes" — but he may very well be one of its Saints. 

Frank. (Laughing.) Ah, that's more difficult! for 
that you must give up things! 

Mrs. Peverel. (With decision.) Well — he'll give 
them up! He's one of those who can! 

Frank. Dear lady, your boy loses one friend, but 
he keeps another! I don't compare myself — except 
for the interest I may take — with such a companion, 
with such a benefactor as Guy. I'm not clever, I'm 
not learned, I shall never rise to honours, much less 
to holiness! But I can stand firm — I can keep watch 
— I can take his little hand in mine. Mrs. Peverel, 
let me be something to him! 

Mrs. Peverel. You can be as good-natured as you 
like — my house is always open to you. What more 
do you want? 

Frank. You know what I want — what I've 



132 Guy Domville 

wanted these two years. I've taken you on this side 
and on that, but you always have some side that's 
turned away. Haven't I gone all round you yet? 

Mrs. Peverel. (Smiling.) You talk as if you were 
buying a horse! 

Frank. I'd buy fifty, if you'd sit behind 'em! Let 
me stand to-day on the ground we just spoke of! 
Let your affection and your anxieties be mine. Let 
your boy be my boy! 

Mrs. Peverel. (As if consentingly , resignedly.) 
Well — he has given you a bit of his heart. 

Frank. He's a fine example to his mother! 

Mrs. Peverel. Remain then in his good graces! 
They ought to be back. He'll be very tired. 

Frank. (Smiling.) With me he needn't fear that! 

Mrs. Peverel. I'm speaking of Mr. Domville. 

Frank. I'm speaking, dear lady, of myself! You 
haven't admitted me at last only to put me off once 
more? What did your good words mean if they 
didn't mean that I should at last have my answer? 

Mrs. Peverel. You shall have it tomorrow. 

Frank. (Gravely impatient.) Ah, you don't treat 
me well! 

Mrs. Peverel. (As if admitting this, conciliatory.) 
You shall have it to-night! 

Frank. Why not now? 

Mrs. Peverel. Give me this last hour! (Then in a 
totally different tone and as if forcibly to change the 
subject, while she draws from her pocket a very 
small box, from which she removes the cover.) What 
do you think of that? 

Frank. (With the box, pleased, interested.) A 
fine gem, an intaglio? 

Mrs. Peverel. A precious antique that belonged 
to my father. I made the goldsmith at Taunton 
set it as a seal. 

Frank. And you went over to get it? 

Mrs. Peverel. For a gift at parting. 



Act First 133 

Frank. (Disconcerted.) At parting? 

Mrs. Peverel. With Mr. Domville. 

Frank. (Ruefully.) Oh! (Gives her back the box 
and turns away.) Here he is to receive it! 

(Enter Guy Domville from the house.) 

Guy. We went further than we knew and Geor- 
die's a little lame. It's nothing — I think his shoe 
wasn't right and that it will pass before morning. 
But I've sent him to bed and told him I would ask 
you to go to him. 

Mrs. Peverel. (Very prompt.) I'll go to him! 

Guy. I'll wait for you here. 

(Exit Mrs. Peverel to the house.) 

Frank. You can't do that when you're waited for 
yourself. 

Guy. Waited for — by whom? 

Frank. That letter will tell you. 

Guy. (With the letter; vague.) "My Lord Dev- 
enish"? 

Frank. He's cooling his heels at the inn. 

Guy. (Reading.) "Dear and honoured kinsman: 
This is to entreat you to give such welcome as is 
fitting to our noble friend, my trusty messenger, the 
Lord Devenish, and lend a patient ear to all he 
will say to you — much better than she herself can 
— for your loving cousin and humble servant Maria 
Domville." (Vaguely recalling.) She must be the 
widow of my cousin who died ten years ago. 

Frank. And the reputed mistress of her noble 
friend? 

Guy. (Disconcerted.) His reputed mistress? 

Frank. (Laughing.) Pardon me, Guy — I forgot 
your cloth! 

Guy. I'm not of the cloth yetl 

Frank. You might be, with your black clothes 
and your shy looks: such an air of the cold college 
— almost of the cold cloister! Will you go to his 
lordship? He's counting the minutes. 



134 Guy Domville 

Guy. (Hesitating, glancing at his letter again) 
"A patient ear"? — I must take leave of Mrs. Peverel 
first. 

Frank. Can't you do that later? 

Guy. Not if my visitor's to command me and the 
coach is to start at dawn. 

Frank. Then / mustn't take your time! 

Guy. Be easy, dear Frank. We're old, old friends. 
You must let me tell you how often I shall think of 
you and how much happiness I wish you. 

Frank. Do you remember, when you say that, the 
happiness I must long for? 

Guy. I remember it. I desire it. 

Frank. You speak out of your goodness! 

Guy. Out of our long affection — yours and mine. 

Frank. I can remember as far back as your 
mother, and the wonder with which I listened when 
she told me that you were to be bred up a priest. 

Guy. God rest her pure spirit — it was an honest 
vow! The vow has been fulfilled! 

Frank. You must help me to fulfil mine — I think 
you can. 

Guy. I shall always be glad to help you. 

Frank. I mean now — on the spot — before you're 
lost to us. You go for years, I suppose; perhaps even 
forever. 

Guy. Yes; perhaps even for ever! I give up my 
life — I accept my fate. 

Frank. (Laughing.) You're not dead yet! But for 
us — it is your last hour. 

Guy. My last! My last! I must therefore do some- 
thing very good with it. How can I help you, Frank? 

Frank. By speaking for me — by telling her to 
believe in me. She thinks all the world of you. 

Guy. She's attached to our holy Church. 

Frank. That's just what I mean. Your thoughts 
are not as other men's thoughts: your words are not 
as other men's words. It's to a certain extent her 



Act First 135 

duty to act on them, so you're the man of all men 
to plead my cause. 

Guy. (After a moment.) Will you be very good 
to her? 

Frank. I give you my word before heaven. 

Guy. Some men — are not gentle. And she — she's 
all gentleness! 

Frank. Oh, I know what she is! 

Guy. Then you'll be faithful, tender, true? 

Frank. My dear man, I worship the ground she 
treads on! And I've a good estate and an ancient 
name. 

Guy. (After a moment.) I'll plead your cause. 

Frank. Now, then, is your time! 

(Re-enter Mrs. Peverel.) 

Mrs. Peverel. The child's only tired — but he's 
very wide awake. He wants to hug you again! 

Guy. I'll go and be hugged! 

Mrs. Peverel. Not yet — he'll be quieter. (To 
Humber.) You've ridden far enough to deserve 
refreshment. They've put some out in the White 
Parlour. 

Frank. I'll drink to Domville's preferment! (Exit 
to the house.) 

Guy. He worships the ground you 'tread on, and 
he swears before heaven he'll be good to you. 

Mrs. Peverel. (Smiling.) Did he ask you to tell 
me so? 

Guy. And he has a good estate and an ancient 
name. 

Mrs. Peverel. Not so ancient as yours, my friend 
— one of the two or three oldest in the kingdom! 

Guy. Oh, I'm giving up my name! I shall take 
another! 

Mrs. Peverel. You have indeed the vocation, Mr. 
Domville. 

Guy. I have the opportunity. I've lived with my 
eyes on it, and I'm not afraid. The relinquished 



136 Guy Domville 

ease — the definite duties — the service of the Church 
— the praise of God: these things seem to wait for 
me! And then there are people everywhere to help. 

Mrs. Peverel. If you help others as you've helped 
me, your comfort will indeed be great! 

Guy. I have my comfort, for under your roof I've 
found— my only way, my deepest need. IVe learned 
here what I am — IVe learned here what I'm not. 
Just now, as I went from place to place with the 
child, certain moments, certain memories came 
back to me. I took him the round of all our rambles, 
yours and mine — I talked to him prodigiously of 
his mother. 

Mrs. Peverel. / shall talk to him of his absent 
tutor. 

Guy. Talk of me sometimes with Frank Humber! 

Mrs. Peverel. {Abrupt, irrelevant, with her eyes 
on the letter that lies on the stone.) Who's my Lord 
Devenish? 

Guy. (Startled.) I ought to go and learn! 

Mrs. Peverel. Doesn't your letter tell you? 

Guy. Read it, and you'll see. 

Mrs. Peverel. I won't read it — thank you! 

Guy. He will be very good to you. 

Mrs. Peverel. Of whom are you speaking? 

Guy. Of Frank Humber. He'll help you — he'll 
guard you — he'll cherish you. Make him happy. 

Mrs. Peverel. That's easily said! 

Guy. Marry him! 

Mrs. Peverel. Why do you speak of marriage, 
Mr. Domville? 

Guy. I, the first law of whose profession, the rigid 
rule of whose life, is to abstain from it? I don't 
speak of it as a man of the world — I speak of it as 
a priest. There are cases in which our Mother- 
Church enjoins it. We must bow to our Mother- 
Church. (Exit to the house.) 



Act First 137 

Mrs. Peverel. (Alone.) To bow to our Mother- 
Church? Am I not bowing to her — down to the very 
earth? (Restless, nervous, she once more turns her 
eyes to the open letter on the table, and, taking it 
up with decision, stands reading it. Lord Devenish 
meanwhile reappears at the wooden gate and re- 
mains unperceived by her, watching her. Re-enter 
Lord Devenish.) You're impatient, my lord. 

Lord Devenish. (Smiling and indicating the 
letter.) Not more so than you, Madam! 

Mrs. Peverel. With Mr. Domville's permission. 

Lord Devenish. My license for returning is al- 
most as good — my insurmountable anxiety! That 
anxiety came into being when, in the act of retir- 
ing from this spot, I had the honour to see you face 
to face. It suggested reflections, and I may as well 
confess frankly that it forbade my going back to the 
inn. It keeps me at my post! 

Mrs. Peverel. I don't understand you, my lord. 

Lord Devenish. You probably will — when Mr. 
Domville does! 

Mrs. Peverel. I'll send him to you — and give 
orders for your lordship's entertainment! (Exit to 
the house.) 

Lord Devenish. There's no such entertainment as 
the presence of a charming woman! If he gave her 
the letter she's exactly what I seemed to guess — his 
confidant, his counsellor. In that case I smell con- 
tradiction! (Enter Guy Domville from the house.) 
But this fellow is worth a pass or two! 

Guy. I was on the point of waiting on your 
lordship. 

Lord Devenish. I've come so far to see you, sir, 
that I made no scruple of a few steps more. My 
visit has, of course, an explanation. 

Guy. I receive indeed so few — ! 

Lord Devenish. It only lies with yourself, sir, 



138 Guy Domville 

to be surrounded with the homage of multitudes! 

Guy. You're ignorant, probably, how little, my 
lord, things lie with myself! 

Lord Devenish. On the contrary, sir — it was just 
that knowledge that brought me hither in person, 
and brought me so fast. My credentials, as you've 
assured yourself, testify to the importance of my 
errand. 

Guy. Mrs. Domville does me unexpected honour. 

Lord Devenish. Not as much as you'll do me, sir, 
if you'll give me your best attention. Be seated, I 
pray you. It's my painful duty to begin with an- 
nouncing to you the death of your nearest kinsman 
— your only one, the late Mr. Domville of Gaye. 
His horse has broken his neck for him — he was 
mostly too drunk to ride! 

Guy. I could have wished him a more edifying 
end! 

Lord Devenish. You might have wished him a 
seemlier life — and a little less numerous progeny! 
He never married. 

Guy. (Surprised.) Yet he had children? 

Lord Devenish. They're not worth speaking of! 

Guy. Surely they're worth commiserating! 

Lord Devenish. For losing the estate? 

Guy. (Still more surprised.) Do they lose it? 

Lord Devenish. It's shrunken, it's burdened, the 
old domain of Gaye, but it has stood there from the 
Conquest, sir, and it has never been out of your 
family. 

Guy. But if the late Mr. Domville's children are 
my family — ? 

Lord Devenish. (Scandalised.) They — a pack of 
village bastards? 

Guy. (Bewildered.) Yet if there's no one else — ? 

Lord Devenish. If there had been no one else, 
Mr. Domville (ruefully feeling his loins), I wouldn't 



Act First 139 

have posted till I ached! You yourself, sir, are your 
family. 

Guy. (As if roused from a dream.) I? 

Lord Devenish. You're the next in succession — 
you're the master of Gaye. 

Guy. (Stupefied.) I? 

Lord Devenish. The heir of your kinsman, the 
last of your name. 

Guy. (Dazed.) To me, my lord, such things are 
fables! 

Lord Devenish. That's exactly why I came to 
announce them. You mightn't take 'em in from 
another! 

Guy. I've chosen my part, my lord. I go to-morrow 
to take it. 

Lord Devenish. The purpose of my visit, sir, is 
to protest against your going. Your duty is nearer 
at hand — it's first to the name you bear. Your life, 
my dear sir, is not your own to give up. It belongs 
to your position — to your dignity — to your race. 

Guy. (Quietly, firmly.) I was bred up, my lord, 
to be a priest. 

Lord Devenish. You were not bred up, I suppose, 
not to be a Domville! 

Guy. The very Domville that, in our branch, was 
always given to the Church! As long ago as I 
remember, the Church had accepted the gift. It's too 
late to take it back. 

Lord Devenish. Too late? Not by several hours! 
Your coldness seems to remind me that to your 
consecrated character there are images unsuitable, 
forbidden! Do me the favour, then, to suppose that 
character a moment discontinued. (Laughing.) Do 
you owe your ferocity to Mrs. Peverel? 

Guy. (Surprised, slightly resentful.) Mrs. Peverel 
has been my kindest friend — she approves for me 
of the religious life. 



140 Guy Domville 

Lord Devenish. And her way of showing her 
approval has been to hurry you off to Bristol? 

Guy. She has not "hurried" me, my lord — she 
has even, from day to day, detained me. 

Lord Devenish. (Struck, dryly.) Ah! — Thank 
heaven for that detention! 

Guy. For the sake, you know, of my pupil. 

Lord Devenish. Thank heaven for your pupil! — 
Have your pupil, and your pupil's mother, sir, 
never opened your eyes to another possible life — the 
natural, the liberal, the agreeable, the life of the 
world of men — and of women — in which your name 
gives you a place? I put you that question for Mrs. 
Domville. 

Guy. Mrs. Domville's inquiries are a wondrous 
civility to a person she has never seen. 

Lord Devenish. Let me express to him, without 
reserve, the extravagance of her wish to see him! 
When she married into your family, sir, into which 
she brought a very handsome accession, it was with 
a great zeal to serve it and to contribute, if might 
be, to its duration. Your kinsman who died last 
week succeeded to his nephew, that only son whom, 
in his early childhood, Mrs. Domville had the bit- 
terness to lose. She has been twice a widow, and she 
has from her first marriage an amiable daughter, 
a consolation imperfect indeed, however prized, for 
the great affliction of her life. 

Guy. The death of the boy you speak of? 

Lord Devenish. The heir to your name, dear 
sir, the tender hope, as it then seemed, the little 
opening flower of your race. 

Guy. When the flower was gathered the race 
was doomed! 

Lord Devenish. Doomed? Not to such easy ex- 
tinction! Don't you feel the long past in your blood, 
and the voice of the future in your ears? — You hold 
in your hand, sir, the generations to come! 



Act First 141 

Guy. (Much shaken.) What is it then, my lord — 
what is it you want to do with me? 

Lord Devenish. To carry you to-night to your 
kinswoman. She has paramount things to say to 
you. 

Guy. I ask nothing of this lady but to let me lead 
my life! 

Lord Devenish. Exactly what she wants you to 
do! She only wants to show you how and to see you 
face to face. 

Guy. I doubt if you measure, my lord, I doubt 
if Mrs. Domville measures, so large a sacrifice, to 
considerations never yet present to me — to every- 
thing I've learned to put away. 

Lord Devenish. If you've learned to put away 
your proper pride, you've learnt a very ill lesson! 

Guy. I know no pride so proper as that of the 
office I've been appointed to fill. 

Lord Devenish. The office to which you have 
been appointed is that of a gallant gentleman, and 
the place in which to fill it is the brave old house 
of your fathers! Do as they did in their day — make 
it ring with the voices of children! The more little 
Domvilles the more good Catholics! Do what you 
can for them, and you'll do quite enough for your 
Church! 

Guy. Break with all the past, and break with it 
this minute? — turn back from the threshold, take 
my hand from the plough? — The hour is too trou- 
bled, your news too strange, your summons too 
sudden! 

Lord Devenish. I reckoned on your great under- 
standing, sir, and the fine effect of your studies! 
If before our meeting, sir, I attached a price to 
your person, that price has doubled since I've had 
the honour to converse with you! Your place in 
the world was in my eye — but at present I see how 
you'd adorn it! 



142 Guy Domville 

Guy. I've no place in the world! 

Lord Devenish. I'll take leave of you on the 
spot, sir, if you'll declare to me, on your honour, 
that you're dead to the pleasures of life. I shall 
be happy to introduce you to them all! Can't you 
figure them, as a gentleman? Remember, for God's 
sake, that you are one! Stand forth like one — one 
of the first, as you may be, in England! That char- 
acter's a treasure that you can't throw away at your 
will! Your kinsman, just dead, dipped it woefully 
into the mire. Pick it up, and brush it off, and wear 
it! 

Guy. Who are you, what are you, my lord, that 
you have come here to trouble me — to tempt me? 

Lord Devenish. (Smiling) To "tempt" you? 
Thank you, sir, for that word! The world is wide — 
and youth is short — and opportunity shorter! 

Guy. Those are exactly reasons for my leaving 
your lordship this instant. 

Lord Devenish. Life is sweet, and friends are 
fond, and love — well, love is everything! (Re-enter 
Mrs. Peverel from the house. Aside.) He has it 
here under his nose! You come to rescue Mr. Dom- 
ville from my clutches? 

Mrs. Peverel. I come to beg your lordship to 
have patience with my country larder. 

Lord Devenish. If my appetite is undeniably 
great, Madam, your hospitality is evidently greater! 

Mrs. Peverel. Its very modest effort awaits you 
in the White Parlour, with Mr. Humber, whom 
you have already met, I think, eager to do you the 
honours. 

Lord Devenish. (After looking a moment from 
Mrs. Peverel to Guy.) Put your case to Mrs. 
Peverel, sir. I leave him, Madam, in your hands! 
(Exit to the house.) 

Guy. Who is he, Madam — what is he, that he 
comes here to draw me off? 



Act First 143 

Mrs. Peverel. To draw you off? 

Guy. My cousin is dead — there are no other kin 
— and I'm sole heir to the old estate, to the old 
honours, to all the duties and charges. I'm lord of 
the Manor of Gaye! 

Mrs. Peverel. (With great and joyous emotion.) 
What news, my friend — what news! It makes my 
heart beat high! 

Guy. I'm sole of all our line, I'm sole of all our 
name. 

Mrs. Peverel. It has come to you, this way, in 
an instant, sought you out and taken you by the 
hand? Then God be praised for your life — since 
he has taken to himself the others! 

Guy. And hasn't he taken mine — haven't I given 
it up to him? 

Mrs. Peverel. (Embarrassed but for an instant.) 
Given it up) — yes, partly! But a priest may inherit 
property! 

Guy. He may do good with it — yes. He may de- 
vote it to the poor — he may offer it to the Church! 

Mrs. Peverel. (Smiling.) He may even, without 
sin, keep a little of it for himself! Is the property 
great? shall you be rich? 

Guy. God forbid me riches! The domain is 
shrunken and burdened. But such as it is, what they 
want of me is to keep everything for myself. 

Mrs. Peverel. What "they" want of you? Who 
are "they," if they be all dead? 

Guy. Mrs. Domville's alive, and she has a plan. 
She clings to the name — she wants to keep it up. 
She has sent his lordship with the tidings. 

Mrs. Peverel. I could love his lordship for 
coming! 

Guy. I could hate him — for coming to-night! To- 
morrow he'd just have missed me. 

Mrs. Peverel. But sure the lawyers would have 



144 Guy Domville 

caught you. They'd easily have followed you to 
France. 

Guy. It's not the lawyers that trouble me! 

Mrs. Peverel. What is it then, Mr. Domville? 

Guy. It's the vision of such a change, the star- 
tling voice of such an injunction! That of my fore- 
fathers' name — which has lasted from century to 
century! 

Mrs. Peverel. Ah yes — the command to wear 
it — to wear it with honour and do great things for 
it! 

Guy. To preserving an old, old name — to giving 
it to others that they, in their turn, may give it! 

Mrs. Peverel. (Excitedly.) They want you to 
marry'? 

Guy. They want me to marry. 

Mrs. Peverel. (Eager.) Not to marry her? 

Guy. Her? 

Mrs. Peverel. Mrs. Domville — your cousin! 

Guy. Why, she's fifty years old! 

Mrs. Peverel. (Prompt.) I daresay she's sixty! 
Then it's their simple duty — to plead for your 
name. 

Guy. I don't care a button for my name! 

Mrs. Peverel. You do, you do — you've often told 
me so! (In an edifying tone.) Such a name as yours 
is a vast obligation! 

Guy. Too great — too great for me to carry! 

Mrs. Peverel. Why too great, when you're young, 
when you're strong, when you've a boundless life 
before you? 

Guy. The life I have before me is not that life 
— the life I have before me is simply my greater 
duty. 

Mrs. Peverel. Your greater duty is to listen to 
such a call! 

Guy. Half-an-hour ago you uttered different 
words — words that were sweet to me about the 



Act First 145 

office of which I was to enter! 

Mrs. Peverel. I uttered different words because 
I spoke of different things! — Half-an-hour ago 
everything wasn't changed! 

Guy. How can everything change when my heart 
remains the same? 

Mrs. Peverel. Are you very sure of your heart? 

Guy. No, I'm not sure! Therefore I go to-night 
to Bristol and Father Murray. I won't wait till the 
morning. 

Mrs. Peverel. (Pleading.) You'll give up — in one 
minute — so great a tradition? You'll cast away 
something precious as if it were something mean? 
Life is good, Mr. Domville: you said so and you 
know it. 

Guy. Then why have you always spoken of re- 
nouncement? 

Mrs. Peverel. (Smiling.) Because, when I did 
so, there was nothing to renounce! Now there's too 
much — ask Mrs. Domville! You'll hear from her, 
as the lawyers say, of something to your advantage. 

Guy. What advantage is like the advantage of 
keeping faith with one's vows? 

Mrs. Peverel. What vows do you speak of? 
You've taken no vows. 

Guy. Not in form perhaps — I haven't burnt my 
ships. But the irrevocable words are seated on my 
lips. What has my life been but a preparation? 

Mrs. Peverel. For this — perhaps: for just this 
hour! To choose with understanding — to act with 
knowledge — to live in the world with importance! 

Guy. (Sad and ironical.) You talk of the "world," 
my friend; but what do you know of the world? 

Mrs. Peverel. Little enough — in this country 
nook! But I should like to hear of it — from you! 

Guy. I'll tell you — when I come back — everything 
that's base and ill of it. 



146 Guy Domville 

Mrs. Peverel. (Catching at this.) Yes — when you 
come back! 

Guy. Then everything I shall say of it will show 
you that we are safer! {Then still nervously, rest- 
lessly irreconcileable.) But what will Father Mur- 
ray say to so black a desertion? 

Mrs. Peverel. He'll say you obeyed a much 
clearer call. I'll despatch him a quick messenger — 
I'll make your reasons good to him. 

Guy. If they could only be good to me! But 
they're mixed with wild thoughts and desires! 
Things I can't tell you — words I can't speak! 

Mrs. Peverel. (Soothing, encouraging.) Be your- 
self, be your generous self, and all will be straight 
and smooth to you! 

Guy. "Myself" — the self of yesterday? I seem 
suddenly to have lost it for ever! 

Mrs. Peverel. Then God be praised! (Eagerly.) 
May I tell him you'll go with him? 

Guy. (Breaking and stopping short.) Mrs. 
Peverel! — 

Mrs. Peverel. (Nervously wondering and wait- 
ing.) How can I help you? — what can I say to 
you? 

Guy. How much of your friendship may I ask — 
how much of your help may I take? 

Mrs. Peverel. You may ask anything — you may 
take all! 

Guy. (Surprised, agitated.) All? (Then as he sees 
Frank.) All that he doesn't want! 

(Re-enter Frank Humber from the house.) 

Frank. (Excited, delighted, ironical.) Here's a 
fine pother, you rascal — with your reverence going 
to Court! 

Mrs. Peverel. (Affected by the interruption, 
coldly.) You've heard it from his lordship? 

Frank. His lordship counts on a fresh start and 
a long day's run for the Domvilles! And I, my dear 



Act First 147 

lad, I pat you on the back! But you look as white 
as my Yorkshire colt. (Mystified by Guy's look 
and appealing, as if scandalised, to Mrs. Peverel.) 
You don't mean to say he won't take it? 

Mrs. Peverel. Mr. Domville starts for London 
— to-morrow very early. 

Frank. (Elated, sympathetic,) Shall I go and let 
his lordship know? 

Guy. Thank you, Frank, you can leave it to me! 

Frank. So much the better — I've something to 
say to Mrs. Peverel. 

Mrs. Peverel. (Disconcerted.) What you have to 
say had better wait, Mr. Humber. 

Frank. Oh, not again! (Confident, but sarcastic.) 
Why not send me home at once? 

Mrs. Peverel. It's much the safest place for you? 

Frank. I call on you to witness, Guy, how cruelly 
she treats me! 

Mrs. Peverel. She treats you beautifully when 
she drives four miles for you. (With her eyes on 
Guy; producing the box.) To bring you an old 
gem that I've had set as a seal. 

Frank. (Delighted.) Then it is for me? 

Mrs. Peverel. It's for you! 

Frank. (With the box.) How can I thank you 
enough? 

Mrs. Peverel. (Dryly.) Don't thank me too 
much! (To Guy.) Won't you relieve his lordship? 

Guy. (Rousing himself, with loud emphasis, from 
what he has just observed.) I'll relieve him. I'll 
accommodate him! (With a complete transforma- 
tion and a passionate flourish.) Long, long live the 
Domvilles! — Away, away for London! (Exit to the 
house.) 

Mrs. Peverel. (Surrendering herself to her joy.) 
He's free — he's free! 

Frank. (Disconcerted, detached.) "Free"? Oh, I 
see. Well, so am I, you know; and there's other 



148 Guy Domville 

news in the air; the good news you promised, an 
hour ago, on this spot, to give me in your gracious 
answer. 

Mrs. Peverel. I can't give it now — it's impossible; 
please don't ask me. 

Frank. (Dismayed.) Not "ask" you when I've 
been counting the minutes — not "ask" you when 
you've given me your word? 

Mrs. Peverel. I've given you no word! — I be- 
seech you to leave me. 

Frank. (Bewildered, astounded.) Then my pa- 
tience that you were to reward, and this present 
that you've just pressed on me — ? 

Mrs. Peverel. (Impatient, brusque, eager only to 
get rid of him.) I'm sorry — but your patience is 
wasted. I'm sorry — but the present is nothing. — 
It's a gift at parting. 

Frank. (Horrified.) You mean you refuse me? 

Mrs. Peverel. Utterly, Mr. Humber! And don't 
return to the question again! 

Frank. (Angry.) That's the sweet answer you've 
kept me waiting for? 

Mrs. Peverel. I couldn't give it before. But it's 
positive now! 

Frank. (Staring.) What's the riddle of "now"? 

Mrs. Peverel. It's not a riddle — but it's a dif- 
ferent matter. (Summarily.) Good-bye! 

Frank. Where on earth's the difference? (Then 
divining; overwhelmed.) By all that's monstrous — 
you love him! 

Mrs. Peverel. (Vehemently brushing away the 
charge, waving away his presence.) Don't speak to 
me — don't look at me — only leave me! (Almost 
imperiously.) Good-bye! 

Frank. (Pulling himself up short, making a 
violent effort.) Good-bye! 

(Re-enter Lord Devenish from the house. 
Exit Frank by the wooden gate.) 



Act First 149 

Lord Devenish. (Sarcastic.) I'm sorry you're 
losing your friend! 

Mrs. Peverel. (Who has not seen him; startled, 
confused.) Mr. Humber? 

Lord Devenish. (Amused.) Mr. Humber as 
well? You'll be lonely! 

Mrs. Peverel. (Mystified by his manner, resent- 
ing his familiarity.) My lord — ! 

Lord Devenish. It's Mr. Domville's last minute, 
and I'm not sure you'll see him henceforth. We've 
particular need of him, in another place,* to lead 
a young lady to the altar: Mrs. Domville's daughter 
by her first marriage, the amiable and virtuous 
Miss Brasier; a bride in a thousand — a Catholic, 
a beauty, and a fortune. (Seeing Domville.) Long, 
long live the Domvilles! 

(Re-enter Domville from the house.) 

Guy. I leave you to your happiness. 

Lord Devenish. You couldn't leave a lady at a 
properer moment. — It's time we should leave her. 
Come, come! 

Guy. Long, long live the Domvilles! 
Passage between Guy and Mrs. Peverel. 
Exit Guy and Lord Devenish. Mrs. 
Peverel alone. 

* The Huntington Library prompt-book contains an in- 
serted speech here for Mrs. Peverel. She echoes: "Particular 
need!" 



ACT SECOND 

Mrs. Domville's villa at Richmond. Mrs. Dom- 
ville and George Round discovered. 

Round. The reason of my "wicked return," 
ma'am, is simply the respect I owe you, and the 
respect I owe to my cousin, your too amiable 
daughter. 

Mrs. Domville. Have you forgotten that I in- 
formed you six months ago how you could best 
express that respect? 

Round. By keeping out of your sight — by per- 
mitting you to forget my existence and encouraging 
you to hope I had forgotten yours? I obeyed your 
command, ma'am; I immediately joined my ship. 
But my ship came back last week. 

Mrs. Domville. It didn't come back to Rich- 
mond, I suppose. This house is not your portl 

Round. I think, indeed, rather, it's a rough and 
unfriendly coast! 

Mrs. Domville. Take care, then, what befalls 
you in attempting to land. 

Round. What worse can befall me than what 
befell me six months ago? The life was knocked 
out of me then, and if I meet your eyes once more 
it's simply that the mere wreck of my old presump- 
tion has been washed ashore at your feet. 

Mrs. Domville. I'll warrant you a wreck that will 
take some time to sink — though indeed you do 
seem to have parted, in the tempest, with your 
uniform. 

150 



Act Second 151 

Round. On calculation, ma'am. As you appear to 
despise my profession, or at least my want of ad- 
vancement in it, I thought it good taste not to fly 
my poor colours. 

Mrs. Domville. The taste of your calculations is 
better than that of your tailor! 

Round. A man's tailor doesn't matter, perhaps, 
when he hasn't come to conquer. I am no longer 
a suitor for your daughter's hand. But I have a 
right to remind you — and this, ma'am, has been my 
errand — that I never promised to forget the tie of 
blood, the fine freedom of kinship. 

Mrs. Domville. The fine freedom of exaggera- 
tion! You blow the trumpet too loud over the 
ridiculous honour of having been poor Mr. Brasier's 
nephew. 

Round. Why is it more ridiculous for me to have 
been his nephew than for her to have been his 
daughter? 

Mrs. Domville. (After a moment) It ain't! 

Round. I've come to tell you that I engage to 
make the best of your conditions. 

Mrs. Domville. "Conditions," my dear creature? 
We offered you none whatever. You were con- 
demned without appeal. 

Round. Say then that I accept even that. A man 
is suffered to see his family before he's hanged! 

Mrs. Domville. That plea doesn't hold, sir, for 
my daughter has ceased to belong to your family! 

Round. (Blank) Pray, then, to what family does 
she belong? 

Mrs. Domville. To mine. 

Round. Yours? 

Mrs. Domville. The ancient house of Domville 
— of whose history, and whose fidelity to the old 
persuasion, you needn't affect a barbarous igno- 
rance. My daughter's about to enter it, as her 



152 Guy Domville 

mother — less worthy! — did ten years ago. She's to 
marry Mr. Domville of Gaye. 

Round. Almighty Powers! 

Mrs. Domville. Kinsman for kinsman, he's a 
much finer figure — 

Round. Than a paltry lieutenant in the King's 
Navy? For you, I can understand it. But for her? — 
has submission been so easy? 

Mrs. Domville. The poor child has submitted to 
him! She's in love, with the most brilliant of men 
— the talk of the town, the wonder of the day! She's 
as gay as a lark and as proud as a queen. 

Round. I shall believe that when I have it from 
her! 

{Enter Lord Devenish.) 

Lord Devenish. By all that's undesired, sir — You! 

Round. With her hand so splendidly bestowed, 
at any rate, there can be no longer any hindrance 
to my seeing her. 

Lord Devenish. Surely in so changed a case, dear 
sir, there can no longer be any reason for it! 

Round. You talk of reasons, my lord, only to 
remind me that I've been long in discovering that 
of the authority you appear to enjoy in the private 
concerns of this house! 

Mrs. Domville. Everyone knows his dear lord- 
ship is our oldest friend — and our most affable! 

Round. His affability I'm scarce in a position to 
enjoy. I'm willing however to beg that you appeal 
to it to grant me permission to take leave of Miss 
Brasier face to face. 

Lord Devenish. Egad, sir, if my voice on that 
matter were sought, I wouldn't give you even a 
minute to take leave of Mrs. Domville! 

Mrs. Domville. (Gracious.) After the important 
event, you can come as often as you like! 

Round. The important event takes place — ? 

Mrs. Domville. (After a moment's hesitation.) 



Act Second 153 

We had given it out for Saturday; but we antici- 
pate. 

Lord Devenish. (Emphatically.) We anticipate. 
The wedding's to-night. 

Round. (Aghast.) To-night? 

Lord Devenish. And my chaplain ties the knot! 

Round. (After an instant, concentrated.) Out 
on your knot! Curse your chaplain! (Exit.) 

Lord Devenish. Curse the beggar's intrusion! Is 
everything quite in hand? 

Mrs. Domville. What does it matter if she 
doesn't see him? 

Lord Devenish. Who can say what Mary sees? 
But everything's quite in hand! 

Mrs. Domville. The wedding-gown hasn't come 
home! 

Lord Devenish. The bride's? It will come! Yours, 
dear Madam, is at any rate in the house! 

Mrs. Domville. You don't remind me, I suppose, 
that I've two old ones on the shelf. The third takes 
longer to make! 

Lord Devenish. Do you presume to convey to me 
that you cry off our bargain? 

Mrs. Domville. You talk as if we were a pair of 
hucksters in the market! 

Lord Devenish. Fie on the comparison! Sover- 
eign, treaty-making powers! Need I remind you of 
the terms of our treaty? The day after your daugh- 
ter, pursuant to my explicit undertaking, becomes 
Mrs. Domville of Gaye, Mrs. Domville of Rich- 
mond, to crown the happy enterprise, becomes 
Viscountess Devenish. 

Mrs. Domville. You make a great flourish of it, 
but you've your engagement still to perform! 

Lord Devenish. Ain't I performing, Madam, 
every hour? Didn't I perform, just now, to that 
rascal sailor? 

Mrs. Domville. That rascal sailor has given me 



154 Guy Domville 

the fidgets! (As he goes up.) What are you going 
to do? 

Lord Devenish. To say a word to Mary. 

Mrs. Domville. And what is that word to be? 

Lord Devenish. Not, Madam, what I understand 
you fear: the voice of nature — in a tell-tale sigh. I 
stifle the voice of nature — for you! 

Mrs. Domville. Not for me. For her; and as a 
penance for all your falsity! 

Lord Devenish. That I was ever false, Madam, 
was a pleasant fable of your own — to accompany 
the stern moral of your second marriage. 

Mrs. Domville. I would have married you out 
of hand when my compunction was fresh; but by 
the time I was free — 

Lord Devenish. It had lost its early bloom? Fie 
upon compunction! Marry me for bravery! And 
suffer me to proceed. I must satisfy myself again — 

Mrs. Domville. That he has really brought her 
round? Pray if he sensibly hadn't, how could he 
be so at ease? 

Lord Devenish. (Laughing.) He's mighty fond 
of "ease"! The fellow's a born man of pleasure. 

Mrs. Domville. It's not all such gentry that 
confer as much of it as they take! 

Lord Devenish. He only desires to be agreeable 
to you, Madam. 

Mrs. Domville. He succeeded from the moment 
he looked at me. 

Lord Devenish. That's sufficiently denoted every 
time you look at him! (Bantering.) I don't mean 
to hint that poor Mary has her mother's inclina- 
tion — ! 

Mrs. Domville. Her mother, my lord, if she 
were asked, would marry the dear creature on the 
spot. As it is, she can only bustle about to adorn 
a younger bride! 



Act Second 155 

Lord Devenish. You'll go for the gown yourself? 

Mrs. Domville. In the biggest coach in my 
stables! I want to make everything sure! 

Lord Devenish. Everything is sure! (Seeing Guy.) 
And surest of all, Mr. Domville! It's a gage of his 
trust to look at him! 

(Enter Guy Domville.) 

Guy. I've been at your lodgings, my lord, to pay 
you my punctual duty; feeling that I owed you on 
so great a day an early visit and a close embrace. 

Lord Devenish. It has been to render you a like 
attention that I have just presented myself here. 

Mrs. Domville. I admire the way you quit your 
beds to do each other honour; above all when I 
think of the hour, last night, at which you must 
have got into them! 

Guy. It was an hour, Madam, I admit, that left 
us no choice of conclusions. The bright star that 
commands my attendance had long since sunk to 
obscurity; that luminary, indeed, to find a single 
fault with it, shines all too fitfully and sets all too 
soon! When Miss Brasier vanished we went for 
comfort to my Lady Mohun — but her ladyship's 
comfort proved singularly cold. — She engaged us 
deeply at cards. 

Mrs. Domville. Surely there's a fine warmth in 
cards! 

Guy. Only in the warm side of them! I lost, on 
the spot, to her ladyship almost the clothes that 
covered me! 

Lord Devenish. Guy always loses to the ladies! 

Guy. I oughtn't in modesty, I suppose, to lose 
my garments! But it's done advisedly, my lord, since 
by the common saying, that kind of ill-fortune 
makes another kind of good. 

Lord Devenish. Good fortune in love. Hark to 
the fellow! 

Guy. Perhaps on your example I ought to aim at 



156 Guy Domville 

both kinds; but what's a man to do at ombre when 
a lady corrects the luck? 

Lord Devenish. This lady would say you're to 
take no notice! 

Mrs. Domville. What on earth does his lordship 
mean? 

Guy. I won't pretend not to know! I think I 
always know, now, what his lordship means. 

Mrs. Domville. Sometimes it's a doubtful safety. 

Guy. (Laughing.) Oh, I've had a lifetime of 
safety, Madam! 

Lord Devenish. (Laughing.) The wretch quite 
dotes on his danger! 

Mrs. Domville. It's such a dear good wretch — it 
needn't fear communications! 

Guy. I don't know how good it is, cousin, but 
I'm learning every day how ignorant. 

Mrs. Domville. Your ignorance, love, was a 
mighty pretty thing! 

Guy. It goes down like an ebbing tide! I pick up 
fresh feelings as you gather pink shells; and when 
I hold these shells to my ear I find in each the 
mysterious murmur of the world! 

Mrs. Domville. You've a trick of fine speeches 
that make us women refuse you nothing. 

Guy. You women, Madam, are even kinder than 
I always supposed you. You gave me confidence, 
you know, and upon my soul, I delight in confi- 
dence. I don't know how much I inspire, but I 
revel in all I feel. On such a day as this, it's uni- 
versal. It doesn't stop even at my tailor! 

Lord Devenish. You may trust your tailor when 
he's my tailor! 

Guy. Egad, my lord, you've ordered my very 
garters! 

Lord Devenish. With an eye to your interesting 
air! We shall see you in white and gold. 

Mrs. Domville. You can see he likes a fine coat! 



Act Second 157 

Guy. I think, Madam, I like a fine anything. I 
can carry, at any rate, what you put on my back 
— and I think I can carry my happiness! Let it 
keep coming — and let me keep trying it! As I said 
to Mary anon, I enjoy my very gratitude. I meant, 
Madam, to you. 

Mrs. Domville. I hope you dc»n't always talk to 
her of me! 

Guy. When I want to please her most of all. 

Lord Devenish. Didn't I promise you'd fall into 
the way of it? Didn't I tell you at Porches that you 
didn't do justice to your parts? 

Guy. You told me at Porches some truths, my 
lord; and as regards the aptitudes you're so good 
as to praise, I'm almost frightened — 

Lord Devenish. 1 ,_ ,, x „ . , ^ ,. 

Mrs. Domville.} (TogBther.) Frightened? 

Guy. At the way your prophecy's fulfilled. You 
told me I should find knowledge sweet — and life 
sweeter — 

Lord Devenish. And love sweetest of all. 

Guy. I had a shrewd notion of that! 

Lord Devenish. The rascal had tried his hand! 

Mrs. Domville. Of course he had turned heads 
ere now. 

Lord Devenish. He sees how he has turned all 
ours! 

Guy. It was not to turn heads I came, Madam, 
but to do my duty to my line. 

Mrs. Domville. And to help me, dear Guy, to 
do mine. 

Guy. I think, if I may say so, that you make too 
much of yours. 

Mrs. Domville. (Grave, sincere.) You were not 
at Mr. Domville's deathbed. 

Lord Devenish. (As if with the privilege of hav- 
ing assisted at a most edifying scene.) I was, my 
dear Guy! 



158 Guy Domville 

Mrs. Domville. And you never knew my boy. 

Lord Devenish. You're taking the boy's place, 
you know. 

Guy. Peace then to these guardian spirits. 

Lord Devenish. Precisely. And before we sacrifice 
to them — 

Mrs. Domville. I must put my hand on the 
bride's petticoat. (To Guy.) Did she go to her 
room? 

Guy. My only complaint of her is that she's there 
too much. 

Mrs. Domville. I'll send her back to you. 

Lord Devenish. I'll instruct him that he's to keep 
her. 

Mrs. Domville (To Guy, significant.) Till her 
mother takes her. (To Lord Devenish.) Make sure 
of Father White. (Exit.) 

Lord Devenish. She'd like to have it over this 
minute! 

Guy. What in the world is she afraid of? — 

Lord Devenish. Of your other love, my lad; your 
first! 

Guy. (Blank.) My first? 

Lord Devenish. I don't mean Mrs. Peverel! 

Guy. (Very grave.) You couldn't, my lord — in 
decency. 

Lord Devenish. Decency — bless us — looks quite 
another way; decency points to our Mother- 
Church! Mrs. Domville is jealous of that high mis- 
tress. 

Guy. I don't know what I could do, that I 
haven't done, to set such jealousy at rest. There's 
scarcely a rule I haven't utterly abjured — there's 
scarcely a trust I haven't rigidly betrayed — there's 
scarcely a vow I haven't scrupulously broken! What 
more can a man do for conscience? 

Lord Devenish. What a man does for conscience, 
Guy, comes back to him for joy! 



Act Second 159 

Guy. Is that why you're so happy? 

Lord Devenish. My happiness is the happiness of 
others. 

Guy. Mine then ought to content you! Never 
once have I looked behind. I've taken what you've 
given me — I've gone where you led me — I've done 
what you've told me. 

Lord Devenish. You've done it monstrous well! 

Guy. And no one is the worse for me? 

Lord Devenish. As a man of the world that's the 
only spot on your glory! 

Guy. I must be sure that everyone is the better 
for me, for that makes me as right as the proof of 
a sum! 

Lord Devenish. (Smiling.) You'll be precious 
sure to-morrow! 

Guy. Then let to-morrow come, and many many 
to-morrows! 

Lord Devenish. Egad, we're catching up with 
them! I shall find Father White at his devotions. 

Guy. Then let him leave his devotions! Remind 
him that I've left mine! 

Lord Devenish. (Attenuating.) It's not after all 
to call him to cards! When Miss Brasier comes to 
you, be so good as to engage her closely. 

Guy. (Surprised.) Will she grudge me her com- 
pany? 

Lord Devenish. Only from agitation. Dispel her 
agitation! (Exit Lord Devenish.) 

Guy. Dispel her agitation? (Thinking, with emo- 
tion?) Face to face with my fortune I feel much 
more my own. Truly I've travelled far from all that 
might have been, and to say the words I must say, 
I must forget the words I didn't! (Re-enter George 
Round. Startled.) Pardon my inattention, sir, I 
didn't hear you announced. 

Round. I came, sir, to deliver this packet to Miss 
Brasier. 



160 Guy Domville 

Guy. Oh, another wedding-gift? 

Round. Another wedding-gift. 

Guy. From the toyman? A pretty bauble? 

Round. A gold ring, sir — with a pearl. 

Guy. (Laughing.) Only one? Pearls should come 
in dozens! But if you'll leave your packet with me, 
I'll take care Miss Brasier receives it. 

Round. My errand, sir — my errand — 

Guy. (As he stands embarrassed.) Was to place 
it in Miss Brasier's hand? 

Round. To make sure it reaches her straight. 

Guy. It shall reach her on this spot. She's coming 
to me. (Then smiling as Round starts slightly.) 
Quite lawfully, sir! I'm the bridegroom. 

Round. (After another hesitation.) Then you can 
give it. 

Guy. Is there anything to say with it? 

Round. Only that I'll come back to see if it 
pleases. (Exit.) 

Guy. To see if it pleases? For a tradesman, the 
fellow's blunt! (Enter Mary Brasier.) You've just 
missed the toyman. He brought you a ring — with a 
pearl. (Then as she appears blank and startled.) 
Won't you look at it? 

Mary. Give it to me. 

Guy. From whom does it come? 

Mary. (With the box, in suppressed agitation.) 
From no one. Where is the person who brought it? 

Guy. He'll barely have reached the gate. Shall I 
call him? 

Mary. (Uneasy, prompt.) No, no. 

Guy. He's coming back to see if it pleases. 

Mary. (Troubled, but turning the matter off.) 
It serves its purpose. 

Guy. (Laughing.) Why, you've not even tried it! 

Mary. It's a trifle — it's nothing! My mother told 
me to come to you. 

Guy. (Smiling.) Your mother doesn't trust me! 



Act Second 161 

Mary. I think she's wrong! 

Guy. Do you, Mary? Your trust will be enough 
for me. 

Mary. You're extraordinarily good to me. 

Guy. How can I be good enough, when I think of 
all you're giving me? 

Mary. (With feeling) You ought to have more 
— than / can ever give! 

Guy. More than beauty? More than virtue? More 
than fortune? More than your rising before me and 
letting me look into your eyes? I came here stam- 
mering and stumbling; but when I saw you it was 
as if I had caught the tune of my song! 

Mary. Everything had been thoroughly arranged 
for you. 

Guy. As things are arranged in the fairytales — 
only, you know, vastly better! The enchanted castle 
and the lovely princess, but never a giant nor a 
dragon. 

Mary. (Grave.) The lovely princess seemed to 
expect the adventurous prince? 

Guy. With all the charity in life! It was as if she 
too had been touched by the wizard. 

Mary. She had been touched by the wizard! 

Guy. (With tender significance.) The wizard 
whose name — ? 

Mary. (Prompt.) We mustn't speak it! 

Guy. Because they never do, in fairytales, and 
our romance must conform to the rules. May our 
rules all be as easy! You leave me again? — You 
won't stay? 

Mary. Yes, if I may make a condition. That of 
your telling me who brought the ring. 

Guy. (As if he had quite forgotten the incident.) 
The ring? — from the toyman? Why, a young man 
with a brown face. 

Mary. What sort of a manner? 

Guy. No manner at all! You know him? 



162 Guy Domville 

Mary. (Embarrassed) I had better speak to him. 

Guy. You easily can — he's coming back. 

Mary. But when, did he say? 

(Re-enter George Round.) 

Guy. Here he is! 

Mary. (Greatly discomposed, but dissimulating; 
to Guy.) Will you allow me five minutes with this 
gentleman? 

Guy. (Surprised) This gentleman? 

Round. George Porter Round, at your particular 
service, sir. 

Mary. I've something important to say to him. 

Guy. (Vague) Alone? 

Mary. (Finding a pretext) It's about you! And 
the ring. 

Guy. (Amused) Is it my finger it's to fit? Talk it 
over, then and send it back if it's not my quality! 
(Exit) 

Mary. (With emotion) You've come back! 

Round. I sent you back your early pledge as a 
sign. 

Mary. I have it. I must give you back yours — 
that you so trustingly changed for it. 

Round. Then the hideous story's true — and that's 
Mr. Domville? 

Mary. You know then — you've been told? 

Round. I was here an hour ago — straight from 
my ship. 

Mary. You saw my mother? 

Round. And your mother's — (Catching himself 
up) The Lord Devenish. 

Mary. They consented to your return? 

Round. They opposed it — with all disparage- 
ment. But I've come back in spite of everything — 
for one glimpse of you! 

Mary. They've hurried this business from the 
fear of you. 



Act Second 163 

Round. Yet they must have little to fear of you — 
from your conduct! 

Mary. Forgive me a little — you don't know! 

Round. It's / who do know, Madam — and I think 
it's you who don't. They drove me off, and I went — 
in the state you may think. Then I got back my 
reason, and it came to me that I wanted you to 
know — to know that / know, and something, on my 
soul, of what I feel! I went to the goldsmith's in the 
town, and wrenching off that little ring of yours 
that I've worn so long, made him clap it into a new 
case. I thought some accident might protect me — 
that I might pass it in to you as coming from a shop. 
As fortune does sometimes favour the desperate, I 
succeeded. The coast was clear and I found myself 
face to face with him! 

Mary. But this second time? 

Round. The porter demurred, but passed me — 
for I asked for Mr. Domville. Mr. Domville had 
done me the honour — he still does it, happily — to 
mistake me for a peddler! But he had taken charge 
of my token. 

Mary. The token of your inevitable scorn! 

Round. When we parted, I could never have 
believed it! 

Mary. We submitted, didn't we? — We consented 
to wait. 

Round. In consenting I cursed your fortune, 
which made impatience look mercenary. If you 
had been poor, I would have consented to nothing! 

Mary. My fortune is still the same. But some 
other things are different. The appeal to me pressed 
hard. And on my life it presses! 

Round. Do you mean he makes such pretty love? 

Mary. I'm speaking of my Lord Devenish. He's 
the oldest friend we have — he has ever studied to 
please me. 



164 Guy Domville 

Round. I think I've studied harder! I don't know 
what poison has worked in you, but I can't look on 
you again without feeling that you're the thing in 
the world I most desire! By the blessing of heaven 
we're alone an instant, and all my life is yours! 
Break with this monstrous betrayal, and commit 
yourself to my guard. Escape while we can escape! I 
came by the river, and my boat's at the garden- 
foot.* 

Mary. In a minute he'd miss me — he'd intercept 
us; a public dispute? Not that. (Then in deep dis- 
tress.) And there are contentions too ugly! 

Round. But your mother's not here. 

Mary. It would reach her. She's only at the milli- 
ner's. 

Round. And your mother's friend? 

Mary. His lordship? He's mustering the com- 
pany. 

Round. Then deal with this gentleman as we can. 
Overreach him! 

Mary. (Vague.) Deceive him? 

Round. He is deceived — make it better. Break it 
to him that I'm your cousin and that your mother 
has put an affront on me. Bring us acquainted, and, 
egad, we'll drink together! 

Mary. (Blank.) Drink? 

Round. (Going up to table.) Permit me to prove 
the liquor. (Pours out a glass and drinks.) Faith, 
it'll do. I can carry more than he. 

Mary. (Blank.) But what do you purpose? 

Round. To draw him on to it, and lay him on the 
floor. 

* The drinking scene which ensues here was deleted by 
Henry James from the play after the first performance. The 
reader desiring to obtain an idea of the emended version 
must skip from Round's speech here to page 171 where, at 
the point indicated below, the play continued with Round 
still speaking: "It's me, love, you'll marry to-night!" 



Act Second 165 

(Re-enter Guy.) 

Mary. Hush! 

Guy. (Surprised and amused before Round has 
time to set down his glass.) Ah, the wine-cup al- 
ready flows. 

Round. For a very thirsty messenger! 

Guy. (Smiling and addressing Mary.) The mes- 
senger's perquisite? Then you've settled the great 
question? 

Round. We've agreed on what's to be done. Shall 
I disclose it, Madam? 

Mary. Disclose it. 

(Exit Mary upstairs.) 

Round. (Promptly moving back to table.) I was 
faintish a moment since — I've had a long walk in 
the sun. 

Guy. Then help yourself, man. (Then as Round 
appears shy about handling the wine.) You'd rather 
I should help you? 

Round. (While Guy pours it for him) You're 
most obliging, but I'd fain take it with you, sir. 

Guy. (Surprised.) "With" me? (Laughing. Ac- 
commodating.) It's the wedding feast begun! 

Round. (With his full glass.) For the poor folk 
that are not bidden! 

Guy. None shall be poor to-day! You're drinking 
a royal wine. 

Round. I shall feel more worthy of it if I share 
it with you. 

Guy. (More surprised, but still amused; humour- 
ing him.) To the complete restoration of your com- 
fort! 

Round. (As if still unwell.) To the speedy estab- 
lishment of yours! (Waits for Guy to drink; then 
on Guy's smiling and waiting, drains his glass.) I 
think another would right me! 

Guy. (Offering his own untouched glass.) Then 
take this! 



166 Guy Domville 

Round. (Reluctant.) Yours? — You take it! (Guy 
drinks and fills again for Round, and then again, 
on Round insisting, for himself; and, glass in hand, 
they look at each other, till Round breaks out sud- 
denly as if the wine has begun to go to his head.) 
I ain't the toyman! 

Guy. (Amazed.) For whom I mistook you? 

Round. (Trying it on further.) No, I ain't a ped- 
dler! (Familiar, sociable.) Ton my soul I ain't a 
peddler. 

Guy. (Blank, but still amused.) Then who the 
devil are you? 

Round. George Porter Round — lieutenant in the 
King's Navy! Near relation — in fact poor relation! 
— to that virtuous lady! 

Guy. (So mystified that he doesn't believe it.) 
Who yet didn't introduce you — to the man she's 
about to marry? 

Round. Her mother's liquor, you see, has done 
that. 

Guy. (Still sceptical and increasingly astonished.) 
It shouldn't be left to the liquor, sir — and to the 
accident of a glass too much! 

Round. Whose is the glass too much? Not yours, 
sir — no glass at all! Not mine, sir — glass too little! 
Leave, on the contrary, everything to the liquor! 
(With the appearance of growing more fuddled.) 
The liquor good enough for anything. The liquor 
as good as the young lady and much better than the 
old! 

Guy. (As if the incident is beginning to strike 
him as more serious.) Pray in what relation do you 
stand — ? 

Round. Relation of worm in the dust! I mean to 
the old one! 

Guy. (With a nervous laugh.) I mean to the 
young one! 

Round. Relation of first cousin — nephew of poor 



Act Second 167 

Mr. Brasier. Remember poor Mr. Brasier? 

Guy. (After a moment, but still smiling.) I nei- 
ther remember Mr. Brasier, sir, nor quite under- 
stand Mr. Brasier's nephew! 

Round. Take me down that and you will! (Then 
as Guy, with growing bewilderment and still glass 
in hand, hesitates to drink.) Won't drink, either, 
with a poor relation? 

Guy. (As if this note touches him.) I will indeed, 
if it will give you pleasure. (Drains his glass.) 

Round. Nothing will give me so much! — Fill it 
again! 

Guy. (Again nervously laughing.) I'm afraid I 
haven't quite your head! 

Round. (Imitating complete intoxication.) I've 
no head — worm in the dust! Is a man of your rank 
afraid? 

Guy. Not of you, sir! 

Round. Then fill it again. (Insistent, persuasive.) 
You should be free on your wedding day. 

Guy. (After a moment.) I'll be free! (Drains 
another glass.) 

Round. (Confidentially.) The old lady loves me 
— not a bit! That's why the young lady — never 
mentions me at all! Quite ashamed of me too! — 
Keep it up! 

Guy. (After he has courteously complied by 
drinking a little.) I should have been glad to hear 
of you sooner. 

Round. Never too late to mend! But she has a 
feeling heart; bless it, I say. 

Guy. Miss Brasier? Bless it by all means. 

Round. I thank you for that, you know. I par- 
ticularly thank you. 

Guy. Why the devil so particularly? 

Round. Oh, you'll see, sir, if you ain't proud. 
(Motioning him to keep it up.) Come, don't be 
proud. You are when you don't meet me. (Going 



168 Guy Domville 

up to table for another decanter.) 

Guy. What trap is he baiting? I'll be caught. 

Round. (Foolishly ingratiating.) Meet me once 
in your life! # 

Guy. (After a moment, with his suspicion of 
Round's design now fairly kindled.) I'll meet you! 
I know who you are, sir. 

* The text of Guy Domville reveals clearly, as indicated 
above, that Henry James expunged the drinking scene from 
the play after the ill-fated first night. But a scrap of dialogue 
found among his papers shows that he would have liked to 
retain at least part of the scene, emending it only to render 
it more plausible. The dialogue was intended to be inserted 
as follows, after Round says "Meet me once in your life!" 

Guy. (As before.) I'll meet you! 

(Re-enter Mary.) 
I was about to meet him, Madam. 

Mary. (Troubled.) I came back to save you — 

Round. (Assured, disappointed.) Save him from what? He 
ain't proud! 

Guy. (To Mary.) He has cured me, I think, of pride! 

Mary. May I speak to him again? 

Guy. Is it very necessary? 

Mary. It's a word or two more — I must say it. 

Guy. You may say it on a condition: that he give me his 
hand. Will you give it to me, sir? 

Mary. (As Round hangs back.) Won't you give him your 
hand? Do it for me! 

Guy. (Checking her; very gravely.) Enough, Madam. I'm 
answered. 

Mary. (Uneasy, unhappy.) You should be answered better! 

Guy. (At the door.) It will serve! 
(Exit Guy.) 

Round. (Impatient, semi-reproachful.) In a moment I 
should have had him; he thinks I'm tipsy — he was coming 
on! 

Mary. He was not coming on — and I couldn't allow it. He 
saw you were acting — he knows we have a secret! 

Round. (Astounded.) Then why does he leave us with it? 

Mary. Because he thinks I've taken part — ! It's a crime to 
practise on him: he's too good! 

At this point James intended the play to proceed, as in 
the case of the previous deletion, from the speech on page 
171 "It's me, love, you'll marry to-night!" 



Act Second 169 

Round. (Coming down with decanter and filling 
for Guy who with a changed manner, frankly wel- 
comes it.) I've filled to your wedding day. 

Guy. You've filled, my dear fellow, but I'll be 
hanged if you've drunk! — Let me set you the exam- 
ple! (Drinks deep.) 

Round. (Who still doesn't drink.) What do you 
think of the wine? 

Guy. No judgment till the fifth glass! — Left 
your ship to come and see us? 

Round. I left it last week. We had been three 
months out. 

Guy. Three months out (vaguely computing) is 
just what I've been out! Devil of a time to be at the 
mercy of the waves! 

Round. (Laughing.) That's the opinion of a 
judge who has not been much at sea! 

Guy. Why, I'm at sea this blessed moment — 
never more at sea in all my life! A pack of things 
may happen in the course of three months — you 
may make a devil of a run. I've made a devil of a 
run — been off and round the world! Ever been 
round the world, in a cockle-shell like mine? (Then 
laughing as Round laughs.) I've trusted my life to 
a craft — as odd as any afloat. I think it's beginning 
to blow — do you suppose my boat'll hold? I put 
out, like you, this summer — but I haven't come into 
port. 

Round. (Hilarious.) If you haven't come into 
port, I'll be bound you've come into burgundy. 
Take care how you sail your ship! 

Guy. Got my orders, you know, for a voyage — a 
voyage of — What-do-you-call-it? You know what I 
mean to convey — 'spedishun o' 'scovery! 

Round. (Looking round the place.) Blest if you 
haven't made, then, a monstrous fine coast! 

Guy. Mons'ous fine coast, Mons'ous fine house. 



170 Guy Domville 

Mons'ous fine wine. Mons'ous fine women. 'Spedi- 
shun o' 'scovery! 

Round. (Allowing himself to become soberer as 
Guy appears more tipsy.) I, on my side, have dis- 
covered a monstrous fine gentleman in monstrous 
fine clothes! 

Guy. Mons'ous fine clo'se! Clo'se and clo'se and 
clo'se! See me to-night in my clo'se — dance to-night 
at my what-do-you-call-it? (Then as if apprehending 
refusal.) Don't dance in the King's Navy? — Teach 
you, egad, to dance! (More and more falsely fud- 
dled.) Fifth glass. Now for judgment! Judgment 
good. (Hilariously.) Keep it up, toyman! 

Round. The moral of my visit, you know, is that 
I'm positively not a toyman! 

Guy. Then why the missch'f come with little 
box? 

Round. The little box was only a little present 
for the bride. 

Guy. It wasn't for the bridegroom? 

Round. (Filling for him in the exhilaration of 
the success of his own plan.) The best offering for 
the bridegroom, sir, is another bumper of wine! 

Guy. (Stupidly submitting.) Sixth glass — judg- 
ment bad. — Why do you drink so much? (Raising 
his glass.) To the health of old friends! (Holding 
out his hand in foolish amity.) No such comfort in 
trouble as the clasp of the hand of old friends. 
(Then as Round, with a stiff, instinctive scruple, 
holds off from accepting his hand.) We ain't old 
friends? We ain't poor relations? Come I've drunk 
enough to cure me o' pride! 

Round. Then I'll even drink to my cruel cousin! 

Guy. (With his glass raised.) To the good health 
of Mrs. Domville? 

Round. Ah, never — I mean of the girl! 

Guy. (Abruptly, with capricious tipsy irritation.) 



Act Second 171 

Thank you to girl me no "girls" — on such a day 
as this! 

(Enter Mary.) 

Round. (Good humoured.) I mean of the sweet 
young lady! 

Guy. (As abruptly mollified.) I mean of the sweet 
young lady. To the health of the sweet young lady. 
Here she comes, the sweet young lady! Your own 
relation, one of these days my relation, our relation. 
Keep it up! 

Round. Now you see him, Madam, for what he is. 

Guy. Eighth glass. Judgment gone! 

Round. So indecently drunk that his very gross- 
ness belies his professions. 

Guy. I'll be free, free on my wedding day. 

Round. Fly with me now. 

Mary. I cannot! 

Round. You do love him, then? 

Mary. No, no! 

Guy. 'Spedishun of discovery! (Exit Guy.) 

Round. It's me, love, you'll marry tonight! * 

Mary. (Painfully agitated and divided.) How 
can I till I've seen my lord again? He put it to me 
so dreadfully on Sunday that I could save his life. 
My mother has promised to marry him! Over- 
whelmed with debt and difficulty, he has that one 
issue. But she becomes his wife only if / become 
Mr. Domville's! 

Round. You spoke to me often of your mother's 
great taste for the Domvilles — but you never spoke 
to me of yours! 

Mary. I have none. But I felt a private obliga- 
tion to listen to my lord. I don't know what it was 
touched my heart when he went down on his knees 
to me! I thought I might tell him I'd please him — 

* Henry James picked up the dialogue at this point after 
the deletion of the drinking scene. 



172 Guy Domville 

and yet escape with my honour. I believed Mr. 
Domville would guess the truth in time — would set 
me free. But now I must face my lord! 

Round. Mr. Domville holds fast to your money! 

Mary. Don't say that when he's so good to me! 

Round. If he doesn't, he has only to know the 
truth to give you up. 

Mary. He can only know it if I tell him! 

Round. Tell him, then — tell him now. If you 
don't, your heart is false to me! 

Mary. It's not false, but it's cruelly torn. Don't I 
owe a duty to my lord — to repay him for the kind- 
ness of years? 

Round. You owe him no duty that's a sacrifice; 
you're the creature in the world of whom he's least 
entitled to demand one! (After a moment of indeci- 
sion.) I know to-day what I didn't know when we 
parted — what it appears that everyone else knows, 
and what I shouldn't have been fool enough to be 
blind to if I hadn't tasted more of my ship's mess 
than of the London tea-tables, that the man who is 
ready to traffic in your innocence with Jews and 
gamesters — 

Mary. {Crying out with dread.) Ah, what are 
you going to tell me? 

Round. Will you leave this house with me? 

Mary. Not till I learn the worst! 

Round. The Lord Devenish, Madam — is your 
father. 

Mary. (Horror-stricken.) My father! 

Round. (Seeing Guy.) Hush! 

(Re-enter Guy, as much changed from be- 
ginning of Act as between Acts First and 
Second.) 

Guy. (With excited sternness.) Our time is pre- 
cious. You're attached to this lady! 

Round. I'm in the very act of begging her to 



Act Second 173 

place herself under my honourable protection. 

Guy. You're not in danger, Madam — if you're 
unhappy! 

Mary. If you've been deceived, it's not I who first 
deceived you. 

Round. Miss Brasier has been acting from the 
first under compulsion damnable! 

Mary. (To Round.) Will you let me tell him? 

Round. Ah, if you'll be quick! 

Mary. (To Guy.) Will you guard him — will you 
preserve him? 

Guy. You ask strange things of me! But I'll pre- 
serve him the more that I think I've not quite done 
with him. I'm at your service, sir, in any place. 

Mary. (To Round.) Leave me with him! 

Guy. Stay, sir — one word! You put on me just 
now a strange undertaking. 

Round. And what undertaking had you first put 
on me? 

Guy. That's exactly what we shall clear up. 

Mary. (Alarmed.) My mother's coach — she's, 
back! 

Round. Do you wish me, sir, to encounter Mrs. 
Domville? 

Mary. (To Guy.) Will you go and prevent her 
somehow from coming in? 

Guy. (With high emphasis.) You love this gen- 
tleman? 

Mary. I love him. 

Guy. Then I'll do better. Will you pass in there? 

Round. Shall I? 

Mary. Mr. Domville's apartment. 

Guy. Three fine rooms in a row, which I owe to 
the bounty of Mrs. Domville. 

Round. Thank you, sir. 

Guy. (Closes door.) Thank you! sir. (Exit 



174 Guy Domville 

Round.)* To what dire bewilderment am I ex- 
posed? I see — but I only half see; so I've kept you 
here — that in this dire bewilderment, and before 
we lose another moment, I may learn the truth. 

Mary. Our engagement then has been a bargain 
between my mother and my lord! My mother was 
to marry him if you married me. My lord's quite 
ruined — he doesn't know where to turn. 

Guy. And your mother's rich — and I was poor? 

* At this point James had a brief entrance for "Mrs. Dom- 
ville with two milliner's girls" and the following scene, later 
eliminated, ensued: 

Mrs. Domville. You dear inseparables! I understand your 
desire to be together; but I'm afraid that for a moment, (to 
Mary) long enough to pass on a petticoat, I must divide you. 
(To Guy.) You'll make it up later! — You won't give us ten 
minutes, to make sure of the set of a tucker? 

Guy. As many minutes as you need, Madam. On such an 
occasion one can't make too sure! 

Mrs. Domville. You haven't fallen out — at this time of 
day? Wait till you see her in white satin! 

Mary. (Distressed.) Mother! 

Guy. I should like indeed to see you in white satin! 

Mrs. Domville. Then there ain't a moment to lose. May 
we have for five minutes the convenience of your bower? 
(To the Milliners.) Pass in there. 

Guy. (Protecting his door.) Not in here! Forgive me if I 
seem ungracious; but my own preparations — 

Mrs. Domville. Are going on with such taste? I hope 
indeed they're splendid! 

Guy. With a splendour that will surprise you. 

Mrs. Domville. Ah, then we won't spoil it! (To Mary.) 
Come quickly to your room. 

Guy. Suffer me to speak to her first. 

Mrs. Domville (Disconcerted.) After you've had the whole 
day? 

Mary. It doesn't seem enough for what Mr. Domville has 
to say! 

Mrs. Domville. The rascal has a tongue — even with me! 

Guy. It's to settle a question of weight! 

Mrs. Domville. Settle your question — but look at that 
shawl! 

(Exit Mrs. Domville with the Milliners.) 



Act Second 175 

Mary. You had the great name. She clings to 
that. 

Guy. If his lordship caught me, he was to be 
paid? 

Mary. Paid high! His lordship caught you! 

Guy. Like a blind bat in a handkerchief. While I 
wondered at his love of the chase! 

Mary. These things were dark to you — and 
they've but just grown clear to me. 

Guy. Dark as deceit! Dark as dishonour! I be- 
lieved too easily. I was tempted. You were offered 
to me — pressed upon me. And you were fair. You 
were given to me with a lie — a bribe! They de- 
clared you were free — were happy. Your submission 
itself misled me, for you suffered when you had 
only to speak. 

Mary. I suffered, but I went on — I thought I 
was gaining time. Time, I mean, for you to see. But 
you were too dazzled. 

Guy. I was dazzled by life! 

Mary. You see what life is. 

Guy. Some of it, yes. Why should you have feared 
to disappoint me, when I was nothing to you? 

Mary. It wasn't you — it was my lord. 

Guy. He's nothing to you. 

Mary. He's my father. 

Guy. {Aghast.) Your father? 

Mary. I didn't know it then — I've known it but 
a moment. It makes strange things clear — the force 
of his appeal. That appeal was like a voice that 
cried to me to make a sacrifice of my affection. I 
tried, but it was more than I could do. 

Guy. You paid for my folly, for my madness — 
you paid for the vices of others! And now we pay 
together! 

Mary. (With decision.) We've paid enough — 
we're free! 

Guy. / haven't paid — what I've cost you. (Won- 



176 Guy Domville 

dering, harking back.) He's your father? 

Mary. It had to come (indicating Round's ref- 
uge) from him! It makes all the past confused. 

Guy. And what does it make your mother? 

Mary. Forgive my mother! 

Guy. God pity us all! How can you forgive me 
for doing you so great a wrong? 

Mary. You're already forgiven! 

Guy. Ask him to forgive me. He had never 
harmed me. But I've hurt myself most; for I've 
been deluded with a delusion that was built upon 
an injury to others. It was to flaunt in it here that 
I was brought. But that's over. Good-bye. 

Mary. Good-bye. 

Guy. Yet if I go, how can I leave you to them? 

Mary. Ah. Let me not look on them! 

Guy. Shall I commit you rather to the man you 
love? 

Mary. Trust him! 

Guy. Then join him there. Here is a key that 
opens the door on the river. 

Mary. He has a boat, thank God. (Devenish is 
heard off centre calling, "Guy — Guy.") 

Guy. (Coming down from the window.) His 
lordship — be quick! 

Mary. (Apprehensive.) But you? 

Guy. Me? I'll look on him! (With a laugh of bit- 
terness.) It serves me right! 

Mary. (Carrying his hand to her lips.) Heaven 
do as much for you! (Exit Mary.) 

(Re-enter Lord Devenish.) 

Lord Devenish. My chaplain's robing — but you, 
dear boy, are not! 

Guy. I've been here till this moment with Mary 
— engaging her closely, I promise you! 

Lord Devenish. (Laughing.) I know the way 
you engage! You shall have guests enough — and 
noble ones. I put my hand on a score. 



Act Second 177 

Guy. But none so noble as yourself, my lord! 

Lord Devenish. I'm a neat figure, eh? 

Guy. Scented like a duchess! Beams of light in 
clouds of fragrance! 

Lord Devenish. Do I dazzle? — I love a fine 
odour! (Holding out his gloves.) Carry that to your 
nose! 

Guy. (Sniffing.) My nose is regaled! (Looking at 
the gloves.) Something French, you prodigal? To 
the finger-tips! And every seam silver! 

Lord Devenish. Straight from Paris. They set 
one off! Take 'em, my son. 

Guy. (Disconcerted.) Take 'em? 

Lord Devenish. Wear 'em to hand the bride. I've 
given you nothing. 

Guy. You've given me too much, my lord! 

Lord Devenish. Well, as you like! But you must 
be none the less a figure. 

Guy. (With a laugh.) I've had a notion of my 
own for that! 

Lord Devenish. Then quick, man; change! 

Guy. I'll change! (Exit.) 

Lord Devenish. He's half a monk still! (Then 
laughing.) But to-morrow — ! (Re-enter Mrs. Dom- 
ville followed by two Milliners carrying boxes.) 
Ah, you at least are ready! 

Mrs. Domville. Is Mary here? 

Lord Devenish. She was here till a moment 
since. 

Mrs. Domville. I've been to her room with 
these women. 

Lord Devenish. Guy's dressing — we shall have a 
company! 

Mrs. Domville. We must first have a bride — 
and at least a footman! 

Lord Devenish. The footmen are dressing too — 
making up white favours. 



178 Guy Domville 

Mrs. Domville. I bade them be brave — but not 
stone deaf! 

Lord Devenish. The rascals are all at the barber's! 

Mrs. Domville. (Calling out.) Mary — Mary! — 
The hussy! 

Lord Devenish. (Calling.) Mary! Mary! 

Mrs. Domville. Is she in there? 

Lord Devenish. With Guy? Go and see. 
(Exit Mrs. Domville to Guy's apartment, 
where she is heard knocking and calling 
"Cousin, cousin! Daughter, daughter]" 
Lord Devenish, alone. Enter a Footman.) 

Lord Devenish. You've come from above. Is Miss 
Mary there? 

Footman. I've come across the water, my lord. 
Miss Brasier's left the house. 

Lord Devenish. Left it for where? 

Footman. I've taken a guinea, my lord, not to 
say. 

Lord Devenish. Then take another, damn you, to 
do your duty. 

Footman. By my duty then, my lord, she's off 
in a great boat, a gentleman close beside her and 
three watermen to pull. 

Lord Devenish. The boat of a man of war. The 
ruffian, the serpent! 

(Enter Mrs. Domville.) 

Mrs. Domville. He's locked in. I'll be hanged if 
he'll answer. 

Lord Devenish. This knave has sufficiently an- 
swered. The hussy's gone with the villain she was 
leagued with and who reached here in time. 

Mrs. Domville. And you saw it, and gave no 
alarm! 

Footman. I only saw, Madam, what Mr. Dom- 
ville himself saw. He waved his hat from the terrace. 

Lord Devenish. Domville, the false wretch, has 
abetted them. 



Act Second 179 

Mrs. Domville. Pursue them. Start the hue and 
cry! 

Lord Devenish. Be off! The horse is stolen and 
it's all too late. From the moment they met we were 
dished. Let them go! 

Mrs. Domville. (Horrified,) Go and be married? 

Lord Devenish. Go and be damned. We still have 
Guy! He's as much of a Domville as ever! He can 
still have heirs. 

Mrs. Domville. He can — but / can't! 

Lord Devenish. Not of your body — but of your 
vows. Mary he never loved! 

Mrs. Domville. More shame to him. 

Lord Devenish. He's in love with Mrs. Peverel. 

Mrs. Domville. (Highly impatient.) So are you, 
I believe, from the way you prate of her! 

Lord Devenish. If I prate of her now, it's because 
our contract stands. 

Mrs. Domville. How does it stand, when you've 
not performed your task? 

Lord Devenish. My task, Madam, was not to hold 
Mary — it was to hold Guy! We do hold him, i'faith 
— through the blessed lady of Porches. If I don't 
demonstrate that — if I don't please you still — 

Mrs. Domville. (Taking the words out of his 
mouth.) I may then turn you off? God knows I will! 

Lord Devenish. And not, Madam, before! We can 
catch Mrs. Peverel — if we act in time: from this 
moment forth she's the only woman he'll look at. 
She'll retrieve our defeat. 

Mrs. Domville. (Breathless.) Where are you 
going? 

Lord Devenish. To Porches again — to see she 
doesn't marry her neighbour. (Elated with his idea; 
confident.) You'll marry yours! ( Exit in hot haste.) 

Mrs. Domville. I believe I shall — before he has 
done with me! (Then as she sees Guy.) Mercy on 
us! (Re-enter Guy Domville in plain array.) What 



180 Guy Domville 

on earth, sir, have you done? 

Guy. I think, Madam, I've done justice. I've seen 
them on their way. 

Mrs. Domville. Their way's a fine one! 

Guy. It seems to me finer than mine has been. 
It seems to me finer even than yours! 

Mrs. Domville. (Dismayed.) Mine? 

Guy. Yours. 

Mrs. Domville. (Conscious, faltering.) Does she 
— know? 

Guy. She knows. She made me know. I helped 
her. Farewell! 

Mrs. Domville. (In anguish, with a supreme 
appeal.) Cousin! 

Guy. (Inexorable.) Farewell! 

Mrs. Domville. Where are you going? 

Guy. I'm going back! (Exit.) 



ACT THIRD 

The White Parlour at Porches. Door from the 
hall left; door to the bookroom right. Mrs. Peverel 
is seated by fire. Enter Fanny from the hall with 
a letter on a tray. 

Fanny. A letter, please, ma'am. (Then as Mrs. 
Peverel, gazing at fire, doesn't answer.) Please, 
ma'am, a letter. 

Mrs. Peverel. (Starting at last; eager.) A letter? 
(On looking at it, disappointed, uninterested, tosses 
it down unopened.) Oh! 

Fanny. And a whole shilling to pay, ma'am. 
(Then, as Mrs. Peverel has dropped again into 
her reverie.) He'll take nothing less than a shilling, 
ma'am. 

Mrs. Peverel. (Vaguely roused.) A shilling? 

Fanny. (Picking the letter up.) It's a deal to 
pay for a letter to lie on the floor! 

Mrs. Peverel. Give him a shilling, child, and 
hold your tongue! 

Fanny. But where am I to find the shilling, 
ma'am? — 

Mrs. Peverel. With my money — where my money 
is. 

Fanny. But where' s your "money" in these dull 
days? (Then perceiving a coin on the dresser.) 
Here's a piece, ma'am. 

Mrs. Peverel. Then give it to him! 

Fanny. (Dismayed.) Give it all? 

Mrs.* Peverel. (With an irritated, bored move- 
181 



182 Guy Domville 

ment, takes the coin from her; then without looking 
at it.) Here's your money, man. Go! 

Fanny. (Aghast.) Why, it was half a crown! 

Mrs. Peverel. I didn't heed! 

Fanny. There are few things you do "heed," 
ma'am, just now! 

Mrs. Peverel. There's one thing I must! (Indi- 
cating a hook lying on a cabinet.) Is that book 
Latin? 

Fanny. Laws, ma'am, how should / know? (Giv- 
ing the book as if almost awestruck.) Are you 
taking to "Latin," ma'am? 

Mrs. Peverel. For my son's lesson. Please tell 
him to come in and have it. 

Fanny. He won't come in for my telling, ma'am. 

Mrs. Peverel. (Flinging the book down dis- 
heartenedly.) And he won't come in for mine! 

Fanny. He'd only come in for a gentleman, I 
think. 

Mrs. Peverel. (Musing.) He must feel a stronger 
hand! 

Fanny. Such another as Mr. Domville's! 

Mrs. Peverel. There isn't "such another"! Mr. 
Domville's was so strong — yet Mr. Domville's was 
so light. 

Fanny. (Glancing down complacently, while she 
gives it a turn, at the pocket of her apron.) Mr. 
Domville was so free! 

Mrs. Peverel. (With latent bitterness.) Well, 
it's not "free" now! 

Fanny. Do you mean he has lost money? 

Mrs. Peverel. (Dryly.) He has gained it. By his 
marriage. 

Fanny. Mercy, ma'am, is he married? 

Mrs. Peverel. By this time — to-day. 

Fanny. And he quite the same as a priest! 

Mrs. Peverel. He's not quite the same. He never 
was! 



Act Third 183 

Fanny. Well, if he was here he'd pay for a 
fiddler — to make us all dance for his wedding! 

Mrs. Peverel. He'll never be here again! 

Fanny. (Sad, wistful.) Nor any other gentleman 
at all? (Prompt.) I mean for the Latin! 

Mrs. Peverel. I'm looking for another. There 
should certainly be one. 

Fanny. (Diplomatic.) I suppose they're precious 
hard to come by! 

Mrs. Peverel. (With a weary sigh.) Especially 
if one doesn't look! 

Fanny. (Circumspect, after a silence.) Mr. Hum- 
ber, ma'am — does he know Latin? 

Mrs. Peverel. I haven't the least idea what Mr. 
Humber knows! 

Fanny. / have, ma'am — for one thing: he knows 
Mr. George is mighty fond of him. 

Mrs. Peverel. If Mr. George is mighty fond, Mr. 
George is mighty fickle! Mr. George shifts his 
affections! 

Fanny. Mr. Humber don't — do he, ma'am? — Mr. 
Humber, ma'am, is constant. 

Mrs. Peverel. (With a sudden flare of irritation 
and perversity.) Then why hasn't he been here for 
weeks? 

Fanny. (At the window, startled.) Law, ma'am, 
he is here now! He's at the door in his coach! 

Mrs. Peverel. (More capriciously still, with 
decision.) Then he mustn't get out! 

Fanny. He is out — he's coming in. 

Mrs. Peverel. I won't see him. (Dismissing 
Fanny, getting her off.) Meet him — stop him — 
send him away! (Exit Fanny.) I won't see him! 
(After an instant.) I can't! (After another instant.) 
I oughtn't! 

(Re-enter Fanny, breathless.) 

Fanny. He's on the stairs — now! 



184 Guy Domville 

Mrs. Peverel. Then I must be tidy! (Exit hastily 
to the bookroom.) 

(Enter Frank Humber.) 

Fanny. She's in the bookroom — shell come. 

Frank. Thank you, Fanny. What's the good news 
at Porches? 

Fanny. There's neither good nor bad at Porches, 
sir; but there's wonderful news at Richmond. Mr. 
Domville's married to-day! (Exit to the hall.) 

Frank. (Immediately affected.) To-day? — Will 
that help me? Nothing will help me! (Re-enter 
Mrs. Peverel.) You must wonder at the motive 
of my visit. 

Mrs. Peverel. It was never my wish that you 
should never come back. 

Frank. It was once mine. It was at least my 
purpose. 

Mrs. Peverel. (Kindly.) I rejoice in your re- 
covery from so desperate a mood. 

Frank. If it was a mood, Madam, it was a mood 
that has remained. The purpose I speak of has 
grown. 

Mrs. Peverel. Then your visit is certainly odd! 

Frank. It's worse than "odd" — it's abject! But 
I've ceased to pretend to make a figure! 

Mrs. Peverel. You place me in the painful posi- 
tion of scarce being able to show you that I'm 
sorry to see you so altered. 

Frank. I doubt not you're sorry, Madam — and 
there can be nought but sorrow between us. I'm 
leaving the country. 

Mrs. Peverel. (Surprised.) For where — for what? 

Frank. For the ends of the earth — and for every- 
thing! 

Mrs. Peverel. (Anxious.) For a long time? 

Frank. For ever! 

Mrs. Peverel. (Astonished, compassionately re- 
monstrant.) But your estate? your home? 



Act Third 185 

Frank. What use have I for a "home" — a home 
empty and barren? We're neighbours, after all, till 
I go; so I come to take leave of you. 

Mrs. Peverel. You go to travel? 

Frank. I go to wander. 

Mrs. Peverel. And who goes with you? 

Frank. I go alone. 

Mrs. Peverel. Alone into strange lands — alone 
into exile? 

Frank. It's better than alone here: close to you, 
yet separate! 

Mrs. Peverel. It seems to me then it's / who 
ought to go! 

Frank. {Startled, flickering up.) If you do, I'll 
follow you! 

Mrs. Peverel. Then I'll stay! (Sadly smiling.) 
I'll not follow you! 

Frank. I wish you a long life — in all this tran- 
quillity! 

Mrs. Peverel. I shall remember you well — I shall 
miss you much. I'm not a woman of many friends 
— I've not a life of many diversions. This country 
will seem an empty place. 

Frank. All the more that I can recall, without a 
reminder, the loss you lately suffered. 

Mrs. Peverel. As I can allude to it without a 
scruple. Mr. Domville's a support — withdrawn. Do 
you know what happens to-day? 

Frank. (With a glance at the clock.) It's over? 

Mrs. Peverel. It's over. I wish him all happiness 
and length of days! 

Frank. I wish him all peace and plenty! Plenty 
of children, I mean! A numerous and virtuous 
posterity! 

Mrs. Peverel. (Abrupt, irrelevant.) Is your beau- 
tiful house to be closed? 

Frank. It will always be open to you. It's full of 
my grandmother's books — old novels in ten vol- 



186 Guy Domville 

umes. If you lack diversions you can go and take 
down the "Grand Cyrus" * or eat pearsf in the 
great garden. 

Mrs. Peverel. (With a frank smile.) Along with 
the child? Do you want to kill him? There are too 
many pears for him here! 

Frank. (Beguiled, with a laugh.) Is he perched 
even now in a tree? 

Mrs. Peverel. Well go anon together and pull 
him out! — What strange land do you go to first? 

Frank. (Impatiently.) What does it matter, when 
they're all strange alike? 

Mrs. Peverel. (With sudden feeling.) Mr. Hum- 
ber — forsake this wild plan! Don't give up your 
own lands and your own people — don't give up 
the sweet, safe things you love! 

Frank. (With a newborn, unexpected tremor 
of hope and suspense.) Don't give you up — is that 
what you mean? 

Mrs. Peverel. I mean — (Faltering.) I mean—! 
(Re-enter Fanny.) 

Fanny. (Loudly announcing.) My Lord Dev- 
enish! 

(Enter Lord Devenish.) 

Lord Devenish. I came in the hope of finding 
you alone, Madam. 

Mrs. Peverel. Mr. Humber is going to a great 
distance. He is here to bid me good-bye. 

Lord Devenish. Well, if that affecting ceremony 
is over I should like the honour of half-an-hour's 
conversation with Mrs. Peverel. 

Frank. (Disconcerted, resentful.) That affecting 
ceremony is by no means "over"! 

* Artamene, ou le Grand Cyrus, a French heroic romance 
by Madeleine de Scudery (1607-1701) was published in ten 
volumes between the years 1649-53. Tne translation was very 
popular in England. 

f James originally wrote "plums" then substituted "pears.'" 



Act Third 187 

Lord Devenish. (Unperturbed.) May I none the 
less, in view of the extreme importance of time 
in the case, venture to ask Mrs. Peverel for an im- 
mediate interview? 

Mrs. Peverel. I've no doubt Mr. Humber will 
excuse me, since (smiling at Frank) I'm sure his 
haste is less than yours! 

Frank. (Significantly.) My haste, thank God, is 
less than when I came, Madam! 

Lord Devenish. That's good news if it refers to 
Mr. Humber's leaving the country. 

Mrs. Peverel. (To Frank.) If you must go — 

Frank. (In suspense.) If I must go? 

Mrs. Peverel. (Smiling.) You can first pull Geor- 
die out of the tree! 

Frank. (Displeased, with decision.) I'll get into 
it with him! (Exit.) 

Lord Devenish. Mr. Domville, Madam, is free! 
His wonderful marriage is off! 

Mrs. Peverel. (Astonished.) And what has oc- 
curred to stay it? 

Lord Devenish. Everything has occurred — and 
on top of everything my coming down here to tell 
you so. You may expect Mr. Domville in this place, 
and I judged it wise to prepare you for his return. 
To that good end I've got here first. 

Mrs. Peverel. (Anxious.) Does he follow anon? 

Lord Devenish. Oh, not till he has turned round, 
I conceive — found his feet and recovered his fall 
from the height of his great match. In honest terms, 
Madam, he has been misused. 

Mrs. Peverel. (Startled, with indignation.) 
Jilted? — Such a man? 

Lord Devenish. By practices most underhand! 
The young lady was clandestine! 

Mrs. Peverel. She must have been abominable! 

Lord Devenish. (Just visibly wincing.) She was 



188 Guy Domville 

beguiled, Madam, by a villain! — Mr. Domville has 
suffered much. 

Mrs. Peverel. I vow I pity him! 

Lord Devenish. He knows that you must! 

Mrs. Peverel. And that's why he's coming? I shall 
indeed be kind to him! 

Lord Devenish. Kind, Madam, but firm! Firm 
with his inclination. 

Mrs. Peverel. (Struck, apprehensive.) You mean 
he'll take up again — 

Lord Devenish. The cruel profession he forsook? 
That's the fear that has brought me! Suffer him, 
Madam, not to! You'll find a way when you see 
him. You'll see a braver gentleman; greater by the 
greatness I've taught him! 

Mrs. Peverel. (Much interested.) He must have 
a different air! 

Lord Devenish. Finer, Madam, and nobler! To 
stifle such an air in a cassock — 

Mrs. Peverel. Would be a grievous sin! But why, 
if he's only dejected, should he come to this dull 
place? 

Lord Devenish. (With great intended effect, as if 
having waited for just the right moment to make 
the revelation.) "Why," Madam? Because he loves 
you! Because he worships you! 

Mrs. Peverel. (Astounded, confounded.) And 
yet was so ready to wed another woman? 

Lord Devenish. Overborne by Mrs. Domville! He 
never loved Miss Brasier. 

Mrs. Peverel. (Catching her breath; stupefied.) 
Never loved her? 

Lord Devenish. He feels the indignity, but not 
the loss; and he had never dreamed that with you, 
who had only known him as the tutor of your son 
and the nursling of the Church, there was the 
smallest human hope for him. The way to save 



Act Third 189 

him is to give it to him! That, Madam, is the truth 
I came to utter. Having satisfied my conscience, I 
retire. To pay another visit in the West. (Invitingly, 
persuasively.) I shall not be too far to hear from 
you. 

Mrs. Peverel. To hear, I judge you mean, from 
Mr. Domville. 

Lord Devenish. I bow to your modesty! But Mr. 
Domville had better not know — 

Mrs. Peverel. Of your lordship's kind warning? 

Lord Devenish. Don't advertise my kindness! 

Mrs. Peverel. Your presence will be the talk 
of the village. 

Lord Devenish. The village is dumb — my car- 
riage is a mile off. 

Mrs. Peverel. And you walk back to it? 

Lord Devenish. (Smiling, urbane, successful, with 
the movement of complacently swinging a cane,) 
Across the quiet fields! 

Mrs. Peverel. But Mr. Humber has seen you. 

Lord Devenish. Isn't Mr. Humber going? 

Mrs. Peverel. (After an instant.) I can't answer 
for it! 

Lord Devenish. (Smiling.) I should have 
thought it the thing in the world you could most 
answer for! Ask him to hold his tongue! 

Mrs. Peverel. (Embarrassed, considering.) I'm 
scarce in a position to ask him a service. 

Lord Devenish. (As if struck by a new and in- 
tenser idea.) Then send him to me! 

(Re-enter Fanny, carrying a tray of re- 
freshments and wine, which she places on 
a table.) 

Mrs. Peverel. I'll send him! (To Fanny.) What 
wine have you brought? 

Fanny. The best, ma'am — and the other. 

Mrs. Peverel. (Smiling at Lord Devenish.) 
Don't give his lordship the "other"! (Exit.) 



190 Guy Domville 

Fanny. (Pouring out wine.) Mr. Domville, my 
lord, used to like it! 

Lord Devenish. (After he has tasted the wine.) 
Mr. Domville wouldn't like it now! 

Fanny. I suppose there's much better in London. 

Lord Devenish. (Amused.) There's nothing 
much better in London, my dear, than a pretty 
country lass! 

Fanny. (Curtseying low.) Oh, my lord! 

Lord Devenish. (Quickly.) Go away! 

(Re-enter Frank Humber. Exit Fanny.) 

Frank. Your lordship desires my company? 

Lord Devenish. (Pouring out a second glass.) To 
have a glass with you. (Then after a conscious pre- 
tence, on each side, of drinking.) Mr. Domville's 
in love with this lady! 

Frank. (Blank.) In the very act of marrying 
another? 

Lord Devenish. He's not in the act. The act's 
undone; through his coldness at the last. The young 
lady guessed it — the young lady broke! 

Frank. (Amazed.) And he took back his word? 

Lord Devenish. (Very ready.) She took back 
hers! He retired in silence, conscious of his secret 
preference. 

Frank. (After a moment; coldly, stiffly.) The 
object of such a preference is surely most con- 
cerned — ! 

Lord Devenish. That object, sir, he has never 
addressed! — Do you conceive that Mrs. Peverel 
would listen to him? 

Frank. (Dryly.) I know nothing about it. How 
is it I can serve your lordship? 

Lord Devenish. (Consciously rebuffed, but still 
assured.) By acting a noble part. It rests with you 
to rout Father Murray. (With commanding au- 
thority.) Mr. Domville must marry! 

Frank. (Struck, sombre.) Marry Mrs. Peverel? 



Act Third 191 

Lord Devenish. Understand that he may! 

Frank. What prevents his understanding? 

Lord Devenish. (Very pointedly.) If you know 
of nothing, sir, the question I wish to ask you is 
answered! 

Frank. (Deeply troubled, thinking.) He loves 
her — Guy? 

Lord Devenish. Did you never scent it? 

Frank. Why, he spoke to her for me, when, never 
supposing, never dreaming, I pushed him to 't! 

Lord Devenish. (Decided.) Then that, of course, 
prevents him! 

Frank. (Still realizing, remembering.) For me — 
poor wretch — when he loved her himself! 

Lord Devenish. Mr. Domville was magnanimous! 

Frank. He was heroic! You call upon me to be 
so, my lord. There's only one way! Not to talk of 
absence, but to practise absence. If I'm gone, he'll 
know why! 

Lord Devenish. I'll take care he knows why! 
(Re-enter Mrs. Peverel.) 

Mrs. Peverel. (Breathless.) Mr. Domville! His 
carriage has entered the gate. 

Frank. (Strongly disconcerted.) And I'm not off! 

Lord Devenish. (Deeply dismayed.) And I still 
less! (At left, hurriedly.) I leave you, Madam. 

Mrs. Peverel. Not that way — you'll meet him! 

Frank. (Putting out his hand to Mrs. Peverel.) 
Farewell! 

Mrs. Peverel. (Keeping his hand.) You won't 
wait to take leave of him? 

Lord Devenish. (Pressing.) You should do that, 
Mr. Humber! (Then while Frank gives a gesture 
of pained resignation.) How then am I to go? 

Mrs. Peverel. (Anxious, at a loss.) Some other 
way! 

Frank. (Surprised.) Your visit's private? 

Lord Devenish. (Angrily.) Private! 



192 Guy Domville 

Frank. (Amusedly.) His step's on the stair! Here 
he comes! 

Mrs. Peverel. (Quickly, at the door right.) Pass 
in! 

(Exit Lord Devenish on tiptoe.) 

Frank. The bookroom — with no way out? 

Mrs. Peverel. (Ruefully.) None at all! (Then 
making the best of it.) I'll free him! — Silence! 
(Enter Guy Domville.) 

Guy. (After having looked hard an instant from 
Mrs. Peverel to Frank.) Forgive the old trick in 
the old place — I've come up as I used to come up. 

Mrs. Peverel. And you're welcome as you used 
to be welcome! 

Guy. The abruptness of my return deserves, I 
fear, less honour. 

Mrs. Peverel. It shall have all we can give it — 
and that of some instant preparation for your 
staying. 

Guy. Madam, I didn't come to quarter myself — 

Mrs. Peverel. (Ironic.) Anywhere but on the 
baker? 

Guy. I sent on my shay to the inn. 

Mrs. Peverel. It shall come back! (Exit.) 

Guy. (After precautions; in eager suspense.) Has 
she accepted you? 

Frank. She has not accepted me! 

Guy. Then, since I helped you, spoke for you, did 
everything I could for you, I tell you that she's 
dearer to me than life, that I'm not bound but 
free, and that I've come back again to tell her so! 

Frank. I know to what tune she's "dear" to you! 

Guy. (Astonished.) You know it? 

Frank. Take care! 

(Re-enter Mrs. Peverel.) 

Mrs. Peverel. I've sent for your shay. 

Guy. (Gratefully resigned.) Then I'm in your 
hands! (Unsuspiciously, to Frank.) You're going? 



Act Third 193 

Frank. (Impenetrable.) I'm going! 

Guy. But I shall see you again! 

Frank. You'll have to be alert! And only, too, 
if so soon again this lady will consent to part with 
you. 

Mrs. Peverel. (Smiling.) I think it will be found 
that the consent most necessary is Geordie's. 

Guy. (Completely genial.) And how is that vic- 
tim of the rudiments? Would he come and absolve 
his tormentor? 

Mrs. Peverel. In a moment, if he knew you were 
here. 

Guy. Then won't you let him know? 

Frank. I'll acquaint him! 

Mrs. Peverel. (Demurring, embarrassed.) Not 
yet, please: say nothing! I've a reason for his not 
romping in! 

Guy. (To Frank.) I shall overtake you before 
you mount. 

Frank. (In weary self-derision). I shall only 
mount a cushion. 

Guy. You drove? 

Frank. Like a helpless fat dowager— in an old 
yellow coach. 

Guy. (Concerned.) Do you mean to say you're 
ill? 

Mrs. Peverel. (Significantly.) He knows the way 
to get better! (The more gaily, to Frank.) Keep 
Geordie quiet! (Frank, at the door, looks at her 
fixedly a moment, as if on the point of saying 
something; then checking himself, exit rapidly.) 
I needn't keep you here. We can talk as well — any- 
where. 

Guy. Shall we go into the garden? 

Mrs. Peverel. (Demurring.) We shall have the 
child! 

Guy. (Suggesting the bookroom.) Then in there? 

Mrs. Peverel. No — it's encumbered! 



ig4 Guy Domville 

Guy. {Looking about him appreciatively, fondly.) 
This old White Parlour has the friendly face to 
me! I've seen it, since we parted, in visions — I've 
missed it in grander places. Its panelled walls close 
me in — the tick of the clock seems to greet me. It's 
full of faint echoes and of lost things found again. 
We sat here o' winter nights. 

Mrs. Peverel. (Coerced by his tone, wishing not 
to break the spell.) Then we can sit here again! 

Guy. I think it was for that I came back! 

Mrs. Peverel. (Smiling.) On the eve of your 
great marriage? 

Guy. That eve has had no morrow! 

Mrs. Peverel. I fear you've been shamefully used! 

Guy. Not by the person in whom I liked most to 
believe. That person was honest. But I think that, 
save at Porches, there are very few others who are. 

Mrs. Peverel. At Porches — if we're not much else 
— we're honest! 

Guy. That's why my heart turned back to you 
and why my footsteps ran a race with it! — Do you 
remember how, at the last, we talked together of 
the world? 

Mrs. Peverel. You said all manner of ill of it! 

Guy. I told you I'd come back to say more. I've 
seen it — and it doesn't answer! 

Mrs. Peverel. You must describe to me what 
you've seen. 

Guy. Ah, much of it I wish to forget! 

Mrs. Peverel. What you must forget is that 
you've suffered. 

Guy. What I must forget is that I've strayed! — 
from the happiness that was near to the happiness 
that was far! 

Mrs. Peverel. But the happiness that was "near" 
was a life you had put away. 

Guy. The happiness that was near was a treasure 



Act Third 195 

not mine to touch 1 I believed that treasure then 
to be another's. 

Mrs. Peverel. You had too great things to think 
of — and now I see how they've changed you. You 
hold yourself in another way. 

Guy. (Smiling.) I try to carry my "name"! 

Mrs. Peverel. (Triumphant, to prove how right 
she has been.) You carry it better than you did! 

Guy. People have cried me up for it. But the 
better the name, the better the man should be. 

Mrs. Peverel. He can't be better than when his 
duty prevails. 

Guy. Sometimes that duty is darkened, and then 
it shines again! It lighted my way as I came, and 
it's bright in my eyes at this hour. But the bright- 
ness, in truth, is yours — it grows and grows in your 
presence. Better than anything I sought or found 
is that purer passion — this calm retreat! (Then on 
an ironic movement of Mrs. Peverel's.) Aye, calm, 
Madam (struck with the sight of Lord Devenish's 
white gloves), save for these! I've seen them before 
— I've touched them. (Thinking, recalling; then 
with light breaking.) At Richmond! 

Mrs. Peverel. (Deeply discomposed, at a loss.) 
My Lord Devenish left them. 

Guy. (Astounded.) Was he here? 

Mrs. Peverel. An hour ago. 

Guy. And for what? 

Mrs. Peverel. (Seeking a pretext.) To see Mr. 
Humber. — He was passing to the West — to see a 
friend — and stopped to pay me his compliments. 
As Mr. Humber happened to be here, he had no 
occasion to seek further. He asked me not to put 
it about. 

Guy. (Abrupt, intense.) What does he want of 
Frank? 

Mrs. Peverel. Ah, that you must ask him! 



196 Guy Domville 

Guy. (With a start.) His lordship? Not yet! — I 
must ask Frank! 

Mrs. Peverel. I meant Mr. Humber. 

Guy. (Thinking, sharply demurring. Dismissing 
this as impossible. Then as he sees Fanny: re-enter 
Fanny.) Has Mr. Humber gone? 

Fanny. Mr. George won't let him! 

Mrs. Peverel. Ask him to please come back! 
(Exit Fanny.) Can you think of no good motive — ? 

Guy. For his lordship's presence here? — Have 
you got one to tell me? 

Mrs. Peverel. (Making a visibly immense, a 
quite pathetic effort.) He came to let me know — 

Guy. (In suspense.) To let you know? 

Mrs. Peverel. (Checking herself, giving it up 
with a motion of disappointment.) Mr. Humber! 
(Re-enter Frank Humber. Exit Mrs. 
Peverel.) 

Guy. (With excited abruptness.) I know my 
Lord Devenish is here! 

Frank. (Surprised.) Mrs. Peverel has told you? 

Guy. He betrayed himself. (Pointing to the 
gloves.) For a conspirator, he's careless! 

Frank. (Loyally feigning blankness.) Is he a 
"conspirator"? 

Guy. In what other character can he have stolen 
such an extraordinary march? (With passionate 
earnestness.) Frank — what has he come to obtain 
of you? It was you he came to have speech of? 

Frank. (Grave, impenetrable.) He has had it! 

Guy. And to what end, please? 

Frank. To the end that I'm leaving England for 
ever. 

Guy. (Bewildered.) To go where? 

Frank. Anywhere that's far enough! 

Guy. (With fresh dismay.) For that man? 

Frank. For myself. For everyone! 

Guy. (Peremptory.) For me, Frank? 



Act Third 197 

Frank. (Still evasive.) For peace — for life! 

Guy. But at his strange suit — his instance? 

Frank. He thinks it right! 

Guy. (With a bitter laugh.) What he thinks right 
won't do! He came to undermine you! 

Frank. It didn't matter — I saw my duty. 

Guy. Your duty to whom? 

Frank. To myself! 

Guy. If it was so clear, why were you at Porches? 

Frank. (Passing this question by.) And my duty 
to you. Don't I know you love her? 

Guy. (Quick.) You didn't know till I told you! 

Frank. On the contrary, you saw I did! 

Guy. (Recalling, seeing clear.) Devenish told 
you — betrayed me? 

Frank. He rendered you a service! 

Guy. His "services" are selfish. His services are 
base. His offices are curst! (Explaining to himself 
now completely, and as if, therefore, to Frank.) He 
got here first to practise on my freedom, on my 
honour. He guessed my secret, and he used it! He 
has driven you from home. 

Frank. Not he, man! My own discomfort. 

Guy. Your own discomfort is his lordship's own 
plan — the fruit of his visit! 

Frank. The fruit of my miserable failure! 

Guy. Is it your miserable failure that brings you 
— without a warrant — to the feet of this lady? 

Frank. I only came to tell her I'm going. 

Guy. And let that danger plead for you? (Tri- 
umphantly.) Frank — you had a hope! 

Frank. (After an instant, pleading guilty.) Well, 
I had one spark! 

Guy. Which was quick to be a flame! His lord- 
ship quenched it. 

Frank. (Convicted, confessing.) His lordship ar- 
rived — it went out! He told me you were free again. 

Guy. 'Tree — free"? Free only to undo? My free- 



198 Guy Domville 

dom, verily, is vast! My freedom, Frank, is wonder- 
ful! My freedom's a boon to his lordship! (Then in 
a sudden different tone, still sarcastically but omi- 
nously.) He shouldn't touch my freedom! For me 
these things are done, and for me another good man 
suffers? 

Frank. You did what you could for me three 
months ago — I'm ready to help you now. 

Guy. Help me by considering that I hold you 
fast! I've known you long, sir: I wish you no man- 
ner of ill. 

Frank. {Moved, perplexed) Then what am I to 
believe? 

Guy. Not that I do a damage wherever I turn! 
I was called into the "world" — but I didn't come 
for sorrow! I cost no pang, as I was! 

Frank. My dear fellow — you don't know! 

Guy. {Struck, wondering.) Do you know, Frank? 

Frank. {Turning away.) Ask me not too much! * 
{Re-enter Mrs. Peverel.) 

Mrs. Peverel. It's a simple case of conscience — 
I must free his lordship! 

Frank. He's in there! 

Guy. {Astonished, then smiling.) All this while? 

Mrs. Peverel. {Gravely.) He has had patience! 

Guy. {Imperatively checking her.) He'll have to 
have more! There's something I wish to say to you 

* At this point James wrote the following speech for Guy, 
later deleting it: 

Guy. (Gazing before him; visionary) I only see what I see! 
Such a counsel — was no counsel; such a duty — was none! 
They offered me "life"! But "life" — for me — is evil! It's 
planted in a sacrifice of others. I put that away yesterday, 
to meet it again to-day. (With clear resolution.) I put it 
away once more — for a sacrifice that's all my own. The high 
call I obeyed had a hidden vice, a fatal flaw, which the 
other call has not. It was all a wild error — a wild error from 
the first; a dark sophistication — and a snare! I bend, Frank, 
to my lesson! 



Act Third 199 

first. (To Frank.) Will you do me the favour of 
letting his lordship know that I've arrived and of 
asking him if I may wait upon him? (Exit Frank 
to the bookroom. After an instant, solemnly.) I'm 
the last of the Domvilles! Three months ago — in 
that dear old garden — you spoke to me, with elo- 
quence, for my line. / believed what you said to me 
— and I went forth into the world to test it. That 
belief has passed away. But the older, the higher 
abides. I tried to forget it — I did my best. But in 
this place again (looking round him as if with the 
rush of old memories) it comes back to me, it 
surrounds me. It looks me in the face, and it looks 
with reproachful eyes. 

Mrs. Peverel. There should be no reproach 
for you, Mr. Domville — because you're heroic. 

Guy. We talked of heroism here — when we talked 
of renouncement. 

Mrs. Peverel. But the hour came when against 
renouncement — I lifted my feeble voice. 

Guy. Your voice was sweet to me — and it's sweeter 
than ever now. 

Mrs. Peverel. Yours has a tone, Mr. Domville, 
that's different — that's strange. 

Guy. It sounds strange to myself, believe me, 
when I ask you — to let me plead again — for Frank. 
Take pity on him — don't send him forth from his 
home. 

Mrs. Peverel. You speak for him as if — (Breaking 
down with excess of feeling. Re-enter Frank Hum- 
ber and Lord Devenish.) 

Guy. As if I didn't love you to passion — heaven 
hear me! And as if — heaven hear me! — I hadn't 
come down here to tell you so! 

Frank. Tell her so — tell her so, Guy. And if 
"heaven" doesn't forgive you I'll set heaven an 
example. 

Guy. As if I spoke without an effort and held my 



200 Guy Domville 

peace without a pang? I grant you freely, Madam, 
it wasn't for that, I came. 

Frank. He came on a mighty different business! 

Guy. I came for a good thing, but I shall have 
found occasion for a better, and I think that in all 
the future I shall have an equal joy of both! It is / 
who shall go! 

Lord Devenish. I've consented, sir, to meet you. 

Guy. I'm the last, my lord, of the Domvilles! 
(Then anticipating Devenish's reply and speaking 
on his quick gesture of impatient despair,) You've 
been so good as to take a zealous interest in my 
future — and in that of my family: for which I owe 
you, and now ask you to accept, all thanks. But 
I beg you, still more solemnly, to let that prodigious 
zeal rest, from this moment, for ever! I listened to 
your accents for a day — I followed you where you 
led me. I looked at life as you showed it, and then 
I turned away my face. That's why I stand here 
again; for (with intensely controlled emotion) 
there are other things — there are partings. (Then 
very gently to Mrs. Peverel.) Will my conveyance 
have come back? 

Mrs. Peverel. (Listening an instant, and as if 
subjugated by his returning sanctity.) I think I hear 
it now. 

Guy. Then I start this moment for Bristol. 
(Sadly, kindly smiling.) Father Murray has had 
patience. I go with him to France, to take up my 
work in the Church! if the Church will take again 
an erring son! 

Mrs. Peverel. She'll take him. 

Lord Devenish. And you give him? 

Mrs. Peverel. To her! 

Lord Devenish. (With high sarcasm, to Guy.) 
I hope you do justice to this lady's exemplary sac- 
rifice! 

Guy. (Blank.) Sacrifice? 



Act Third 201 

Lord Devenish. That of a sentiment my con- 
sideration for her forbids me to name. 

Frank. She loves you, Guy! 

Lord Devenish. He doesn't deserve to know it. 
(Then smiling, gallant to Mrs. Peverel.) If it were 
me, Madam! (From the threshold.) Pity me! 

Mrs. Peverel. It was a dream, but the dream is 
past! 

Guy. (Gathering himself slowly from a deep, 
stupefied commotion.) The Church takes me! (To 
Mrs. Peverel.) Be kind to him. (To Frank.) Be 
good to her. (At the door.) Be good to her. 

Frank. Mrs. Peverel — I shall hope! 

Mrs. Peverel. Wait!
