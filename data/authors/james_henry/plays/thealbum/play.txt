ACT FIRST 

The convenient, inhabited hall of a handsome modern country- 
bouse, which exhibits several signs of confusion and disarray, as if 
something has happened to interrupt the regular routine; Up toward 
the left the passage to the outer hall, the entrance to the house, and 
also to some of the apartments. Up toward the right the passage to 
other apartments. Half-way down, to the right, a large French 
window, open to the garden and park. Corresponding to it, to the 
left, the door to the library, constituting another entrance to the house. 

Lady Bassbt enters briskly from the outer ball, in ber bat and mantle, dressed 
for a journey, carrying with her a dressing-bag substantially stuffed. She 
places it on one of the tables ; then bunting about a moment finds a book 
in another part of the room and, bringing it over, proceeds to pack it into 
her bag. While she is so engaged Teddy Ashdown enters from the 
outer hall, in his hat and Inverness cape, likewise carrying a dressing- 
bag. In his other hand he carries a note in an enclosed envelope. He 
stops short an instant, watching Lady Basset. 

TEDDY. 

Is that the second volume ? 

LADY BASSET, serenely packing. 

Dear Maud has it. This is the third. You had better 
take the first. 

TEDDY, coming down, putting his bag on another table. 

Oh, IVe read it ! 



4 THE ALBUM 

LADY BASSET. 

That doesn't matter — it completes the set. 

TEDDY. 

But it deprives the house — ! 

LADY BASSET, her bag in her hand ; now all ready to go. 

The house can afford it, and in this upheaval it's an 
advantage there should be fewer things to lie about. 

TEDDY, artless. 

To "lie ''about? 

LADY BASSET. 

When confusion reigns I take a line. There's not a 
creature anywhere — I carry my own luggage. 

TEDDY, taking his bag again. 

So do I ! 

LADY BASSET, perceiving the note in his hand. 

You also carry the letters ? 

TEDDY, reading again the superscription. 
Till I find the Vicar. (Then handing her the note, quoting.) 

" Very urgent " ! 

LADY BASSET, who has taken the note from him. 

Then why dorit you find the Vicar ? 

TEDDY, putting down his bag again ; very vague. 

I'm looking ! 



. ACT FIRST 5 

LADY BASSET, preoccupied with the note, which she retains. 

Dear Maud has him. 

TEDDY, startled, decided. 

Then I must find dear Maud. 

LADY BASSET. 
VOU WOn^t one never does. (Turning the note over and round.) 

From Mr. Lamb? 

TEDDY, assenting. 

The soHcitor : to be particularly attended to. 

LADY BASSET, with unfaltering decision. 

I'll attend to it. 

TEDDY, surprised. 

You'll read it ? 

LADY BASSET. 

When confusion reigns I take a line. (Then having resolutely 

opened and reading the note) " Sir Ralph wirCS arrival pleaSC 

see that he's met at Junction." '(Struck, thinking.) Sir 
Ralph Damant ? 

TEDDY. 

The next of kin — they've sent for him. 

LADY BASSET, thoughtful ; refolding the note. 

The next of kin? I know — unmarried. I'll see that 
he's met ! (Then determined.) I'll meet him ! 

TEDDY, still more surprised. 

But you go by the other station. 



6 THE ALBUM 

LADY BASSET. 

I don't go. I Stay. 

TEDDY, in suspense. 

And dear Maud ? 

LADY BASSET. 

You'll take her off. 

TEDDY, eager. 

In a moment — if she'll come. 

LADY BASSET. 

But you'll first take my bag. 

TEDDY, with the bag she has again placed on the table. 

Take it— ? 

LADY BASSET. 

Back to my room. 

TEDDY. 

And tell Miss Jesmond ? 

LADY BASSET. 

Miss Jesmond's out. She's heartless. 

TEDDY, blank. 

Heartless ? 

LADY BASSET. 

With her protector, her patron, dying ! 

TEDDY, still more blank. 

Dying ? 



ACT FIRST 7 

LADY BASSET. 

If the nearest of kin is sent for. 

TEDDY, struck ; rucfuL 

What a pity w^re not near ! 

LADY BASSET. 

One is — when one's on the spot IVe been in houses 
before when the head has been taken ill and the guests 
have scattered like frightened sheep. But I hold that 
guests have duties, and IVe always remained at my post. 

(Seeing Maud Vanneck : enter Maud Vannbck from the outer hall, dressed 

also for traveUing.) Mf. Bedford's dying ! 

MAUD, in a waistcoat, with an eye-glass. 

Already ? 

LADY BASSET. 

Before one can turn round. It has taken only a summer 
night to empty the house. 

MAUD. 

It seems to me we fill it a good deal ! But Tve sent 
the Vicar for my bag. 

LADY BASSET. 

You go with Mr. Ashdown. 

MAUD, after an instant. 

And whom do you go with ? 

TEDDY. 

She doesn't go. You and I go together ! 



THE ALBUM 
LADY BASSET. 



I remain — to act. 



TEDDY, to Maud; explaining. 

For poor Mr. Bedford — to receive the heir. 

MAUD, struck. 

Is there an heir ? 

TEDDY, taking his note with quick compunction back from Lady Basset. 

By the way, he must be met ! 

MAUD, surprised, ironic 

By her ladyship ? 

LADY BASSET. 

For common decency. There's no one else ! 

MAUD. 

Isn't there Miss Jesmond ? 

LADY BASSET. 

Miss Jesmond doesn't count. A person in her position 
— a, dependent. 

TEDDY. 

Besides, she's out. 

MAUD. 

Only at the station — hurrying people off. 

LADY BASSET, struck. 
The station ? (Catching Maud's arm and in the inadvertence of her dis- 
composure precipitately betraying herself.) Then shc'll SCe him firSt ! 



ACT FIRST 9 

MAUD, with reproachful superiority. 

Is it your kind calculation that / shall see him last ? 

TEDDY. 

Don't see him at all ! Travel with me I (Then as the Vicar 
aK)ears.) Here's your bag ! 

Enter the Vicar from the outer hall wearing his hat and carrying a 
lady's dressing-bag. 

MAUD. 

Take it back ! (Seating herself with resolution.) I remain. 

TEDDY, seating himself in the same manner. 

Then / remain. 

LADY BASSET, to the Vicar ; abrupt, imperative. 

Take me to the Junction — it's your duty. 

THE VICAR, youngish, bland, blond, flustered. 

There isn't a conveyance — everything's out ! 

MAUD, to Lady Basset. 

If you go there, my dear, / go ! 

TEDDY, to Maud. 
And if you go, I go ! (Then to the Vicar, as Lady Basset turns 
away with a disconcerted shrug.) YoU mUSt gO — tO meet the 

heir! 

THE VICAR. 

Sir Ralph ? he's coming ? 



lo THE ALBUM 

TEDDY. 

This moment. (To get nd of him.) Go quick ! 

LADY BASSET. 

Receive him with all the honours. 

MAUD, laughing. 

Don't mind that — leave the reception to us ! 

THE VICAR, at a loss, with his bag. 

But how shall I get there ? 

TEDDY. 

Catch a pony — ride ! 

THE VICAR, with a happy thought. 

ril run ! 



Exit the Vicar with the bag to the outer hall. 



TEDDY, to Maud, amused. 

He has sneaked your bag ! 

MAUD. 

Recover it — take it back to my room. 

LADY BASSET. 

Do nothing of the sort — take mine. 

TEDDY, with Lady Basset's bag. 

I'll take both ! 



Exit Teddy to the outer hall. 



ACT FIRST II 

MAUD, with dignity and resentment. 

That's not the sort of girl I am ! 

LADY BASSET. 

What sort do you mean ? 

MAUD. 

The sort that goes up to London with unscrupulous 
young men. You interpret strangely your pledge to my 
absent mother. 

LADY BASSET. 

You talk as if your absent mother were in paradise ! 

MAUD. 

She's only at Zanzibar, I know — on her tour round the 
globe. But I'm none the less entitled to your con- 
scientious care. 

LADY BASSET. 

Why then are you so nasty when I endeavour to dis- 
pose of you properly ? 

MAUD. 

Do you call it disposing of me properly to dispose of 
me to Mr. Ashdown ? 

LADY BASSET. 

He's the only person I've met who takes any notice of 
you! 

MAUD. 

You don't meet many people, I know, for every one 
runs away from you ! 



12 THE ALBUM 

LADY BASSET. 

My mother never did, my dear, as yours has done from 

you ! 

MAUD. 

She'll come back as soon as she receives the account 
Fve written her of your selfishness. 

LADY BASSET. 

It doesn't compare with hers, I think ; for I accepted, 
when I rashly consented to take you out, the problem 
she unnaturally shirked ! 

MAUD. 

You took me from cold calculation — you knew I would 
prove attractive. 

LADY BASSET, protesting, derisive. 

Attractive ? 

MAUD. 

To single gentlemen — and others. And then let you 

get hold of them ! (After an instant, with triumphant emphasis.) 

That's not the sort of girl I am ! 

LADY BASSET. 

If I had been aware of the sort you are I never would 
have looked at you ! I cable to Zanzibar that I throw 
you up. 

MAUD. 

You leave me unprotected ? Very well : I can face the 
usual dangers ! 



ACT FIRST 13 

LADY BASSET. 

You seem highly familiar with them ! (Then, after a moment, 

in a different tone, as if with a new, superseding thought.) Can yOU face 

Miss Jesmond ? 

MAUD, blank. 

What danger does she present ? 

LADY BASSET. 

That of producing an early impression on Sir Ralph 
Damant. 

MAUD. 

The gentleman about to arrive ? 

LADY BASSET. 

The nearest of kin, the heir to this lovely Courtlands. 

MAUD. 

How are you sure he's the heir ? 

LADY BASSET. 

Mr. Bedford's to make a new will. Mr. Lamb, his 
solicitor, is with him. 

MAUD. 

To make it in favour of Sir Ralph ? 

LADY BASSET. 

Naturally — if he has called him to his bedside. 

MAUD, thoughtful. 

Yes ; he wouldn't bring him from London only to cut 
him off ! But aren't there other relatives ? 



14 THE ALBUM 

LADY BASSET. 

Far-away kindred — people with means of their own. I 
used to hear of them from my husband. 

MAUD. 

In the improvident days when you had a husband ! 
Has no one else expectations ? 

LADY BASSET. 

Miss Jesmond has plenty, I suppose ! 

MAUD, blank. 

Do you mean he*ll do more for her ? Hasn't she lived 
on him for years ? 

LADY BASSET. 

For the last four or five. She has enjoyed every luxury, 
in return for promiscuous services rendered as an 
" amanuensis " — functions mysterious and elastic ! But 
as the daughter of an old friend — the clergyman who 
was this one's predecessor and who died without leaving 
a farthing — he may think her a deserving object. 

MAUD, after an instant 

Do you mean she'll lie in wait for Sir Ralph ? 

LADY BASSET. 

She's just that kind of person. It's the way she's 
dangerous. Therefore keep an eye on her. 

MAUD, after another instant 

Do you set me to watch her so that you may be free to 
look after Sir Ralph ? 



ACT FIRST 15 

LADY BASSET. 

I give you my reasons for thinking that he may be of 
interest to her. 

MAUD. 

But why should she be of interest to him ? 

LADY BASSET. 

Because she's so pretty and so clever. 

MAUD. 

Has she had the Higher Education ? No ? Then she's 
not a trained intelligence ! 

LADY BASSET. 

I believe it is an intellectual gymnastic to cope with the 
coldness of Sir Ralph ! 

MAUD. 

Is he so exempt from the weaknesses of his sex ? 

LADY BASSET. 

I've never seen him, but I've heard of his peculiar atti- 
tude — the dread of the dizziness of great heights. He 
has a terror of eminent women — the fascination of the 
abyss. It's a fixed idea with him that if he neglects his 
defences he may some day take the jump. 

MAUD. 

Find himself practically engaged ? 

LADY BASSET. 

Find himself legally married. 



i6 THE ALBUM 

\L\UD. 
Are there such a lot of things to marry him for ? 

LADY BASSET. 

Figure them up ! A good old title — a. creation of Eliza- 
beth. A quiet mind about other women. A very good 

fortune, and (with a gesture for the whole place about them) a very 

fine prospect ! 

MAUD. 

If he has money enough to go in fear, why does poor 
Mr. Bedford leave him more ? 

LADY BASSET. 

To increase his terror — a harmless joke of the dear 
man! 

MAUD. 

Do you mean because Mr. Bedford himself has a passion 
for us ? 

LADY BASSET. 

Uncontrolled — but platonic ! Besides, there's no other 
cousin. 

MAUD. 

None at all ? 

.LADY BASSET. 

There was one, I believe, but he's lost to sight. 

MAUD. 

Trust him to turn up ! 



ACT FIRST 17 

LADY BASSET. 

They have trusted him, but always in vain. He was 
wild, he was worthless — good for nothing but America, 
to which he went. 

MAUD. 

If he went he can come back. 

LADY BASSET. 

Not, luckily, from the grave — luckily, I mean, for Sir 
Ralph. Mr. Bedford has knowledge of his death. 

MAUD. 

And have you knowledge of his name ? 

LADY BASSET. 

His name ? Mark Bernal. 

MAUD, after an instant, rising. 

I thank you for your solid facts. Very nice of you ! 

LADY BASSET. 

Haven't I justified my warning about Miss Jesmond ? 

MAUD. 
Perfectly. (After another instant, in the tone of one who has won a diplo- 
matic victory.) Make her your charge ! 

LADY BASSET, blank ; then disconcerted, indignant, rising. 

You're ungrateful — and you're sly I 

Enter Mark Bernal from the outer hall. 
VOL. II C 



iLi^ 



i8 THE ALBUM 

MAUD, seeing him first ; privately. 

Not a bit — see how frank I shall be with Sir Ralph ! 

LADY BASSET, to herself, startled, turning ; taking in Mark Bernal 
with emotion and surprise. 

Sir Ralph ? 

BERNAL, a man of some thiee-and-thirtyi; very good-looking, but of un- 
conventional aspect ; with a long fair moustache, a mixed, informal suit, 
composed of articles that don't match ; a soft hat, a light overcoat over one 
arm and a painter's album, a sketch-book of moderate size — new and covered 
with brown linen— carried in the other : stopping short as he sees the two 
women, looking vaguely from one of them to the other ; then, eagerly, as 
he comes down. 

My cousin's ill ? I heard in the village how grave it is. 

LADY BASSETT, solemnly sympathetic, but intensely gracious 
and reassuring. 

The dear man suffers, but I'm watching ! 

MAUD, with the same effusion of condolence ; very ingratiating. 

The party broke up ; but it seemed to me (smiling signifi- 
candy at Bernal) quite twt th6 moment to tum one's back ! 

LADY BASSET. 

At the door there was no one to receive you ? 

BERNAL. 

It Stood wide open, and, as I rang in vain, I ventured 
at last to walk in. 

MAUD, seductive. 

You needn't have been afraid, with the place as good as 
your own ! 



ACT FIRST 19 

LADY BASSET, irrcsbtiblc. 

You must let me share your authority till the servants 
are again at their posts. 

BERNALr, who has looked, as they alternately address htm, in bewilderment 
and mystification from one of the women to the other. 

My ** authority," madam, is small, and my title to 
possession nil ! 

LADY BASSET. 

You speak from your characteristic reserve ! 

MAUD. 

You'll find your essential strength when youVe seen Mr. 
Bedford 

BERNAL, more and more confounded, but also dawningly amused. 

My essential strength ? 

LADY BASSET, arch. 

You can't evade your fate ! 

BERNAL, blank. 

My fate ? 

LADY BASSET. 

The way to learn it is to let me take you to our honoured 
friend. 

MAUD, eagerly interposing. 

Permit me to recommend your waiting, while this lady 
goes to ask leave. 

BERNAL, hesitating afresh, thinking, looking still, in his guarded wonder* 
ment, from one of them to the other. 

Is his present state very critical ? 



20 THE ALBUM 

LADY BASSET. 

Dear Maud will oblige you by ascertaining. He*s shut 
up at present with his solicitor. 

• MAUD. 
Inevitably, alas, at such a moment, with the future of 
such possessions at stake f 

LADY BASSET. 

Their commanding extent demands the presence of the 
family. 

BERNAL, dazed, echoing. 

The family ? 

LADY BASSET. 

Reduced to you^ happy man, though you pretend you 
don't appreciate it ! 

BERNAL. 

You accuse me of pretending, madam ; but I won't 
pretend I understand you ! (After an instant.) Give me 
time to turn round — Vm painfully affected, (indicating the 
long window.) I'll go out z. moment. 

MAUD, almost pouncing on him. 

Into the air ? I'll take you ! 

LADY BASSET, baffled by Maud's alertness, looking round her quickly and 
spying Bbrnal's album, which he has placed on a table and of which she 
possesses herself. 

I'll take your charming companion ! 

BERNAL, anxious, ingenuous, demurring. 

Then who'll be near my cousin ? 



ACT FIRST 21 

LADY BASSET. 

The vicar, the lawyer, the doctor, the nurse. 

MAUD, wifh a sarcastic inflection. 

And also Miss Grace Jesmond ! 

BERNAL, vague. 

Miss Grace Jesmond ? 

LADY BASSET. 

A person employed. 

MAUD. 

One of the fixtures. 

BERNAL, innocent. 

She goes with the house ? 

LADY BASSET. 

Scarcely to enhance its value ! 

MAUD. 

She has value enough to be paid ! 

BERNAL, vague. 

Paid? 

LADY BASSET. 

Wages. She writes for the dear man, she reads for him, 
and I daresay she ciphers ! 

MAUD, who has possessed herself, officiously, to carry it, of Bernal's light 
overcoat in the same way that Lady Basset has appropriated the sketch-hook. 

But she hasn't had the Higher Education ! 



22 THE ALBUM 

BERNAL, laughing and trying to take his coat back from Maud. 
I haven't had it myself! (Then as she whisks away the coat, 

escaping to the right,) Take care — there are things in the 
pockets ! 

MAUD, victorious, challenging ; in the long window with the coat. 

Then come and get them ! 

Flirts out to the park. 

LADY BASSET, nursing the sketch-book ; sociably, while Bernal, at the 
window, appearing to hesitate, looks at her an instant 

Which of us do you prefer ? 

BERNAL, clapping the empty pockets of his waistcoat and jacket, as if with 
alarm, successively and quickly. 

I prefer my cigarettes ! 

Exit Bernal by the window. 

LADY BASSET, disconcerted, considering. 

Shall I follow with this ? (Opening the album ; turning a page 

or two.) Real art ? my passion ! (Then to herself, as she sees 

Grace Jesmond at the left — enter Grace J Esmond from the library— dropping 
the book on a table as if to disconnect herself from every sign of the visitor's 
passage.) Ah ! 

GRACEj back from the station, in her hat and jacket ; stopping short, surprised 
at still finding Lady Basset, and speaking impulsively. 

You're not gone ? 

LADY BASSET, uncompromising. 

And not going ! 

GRACE, struck, eager. 

Then Mr. Bedford's better ? 



ACT FIRST 23 

LADY BASSET, at the window; vicious. 

Mr. Bedford's worse ! 

Exit Lady Basset to the park. 
GRACE, alone, dolorous, interrogative. 

*' Worse?" 

Enter a Footman from the outer hall. 
FOOTMAN. 

Sir Ralph Damant ! 

Enter Sir Ralph Damant. Exit Footman. 
GRACE, instantly, sadly.' 

Mr. Bedford's worse ! 

SIR RALPH, stopping short with the force of his contained emotion. 
Ah ? (Then, after an instant, while he has stood with lowered eyes.) How 

much worse? 

GRACE. 

Even a little (thinking, discouraged) may be more than 
enough ! 

SIR RALPH. 

How lately have you seen him ? 

GRACE. 
Not this morning. I've been at the station — seeing 
people off. 

SIR RALPH. 

He has had " people " again ? , 



24 THE ALBUM 

GRACE. 
A large party. 

SIR RALPH. 

Women, as usual ? 

GRACE. 

Several ladies. 

SIR RALPH. 

They've all gone ? 

GRACE. 

Not quite all. 

SIR RALPH. 

All but you ? . 

GRACE. 
I don't go (after an instant, with the note of quiet irony) qulte yCt. 

And two others remain. 

SIR RALPH, with a slight start and a glance round him. 

Two Others ? Where are they ? 

GRACE, nodding toward the window. 

I think in the park. 

SIR RALPH, peremptory. 

Then send them off! 

GRACE, cold. 

I'll leave you to do that. 

SIR RALPH. 

Fve more immediate duties — I've been sent for. 



ACT FIRST 25 

GRACE. 
So I heard — before going out. 

SIR RALPH. 

You range the country — with poor Mr. Bedford dying ? 

GRACE, after an instant. 

I've not said that he's dying. 

SIR RALPH, perceptibly pulled up. 

Then, pray, why was I dragged here ? 

GRACE. 
I had nothing to do with dragging you. His doctor's 
with him — and his clergyman. And Mr. Lamb, his 
lawyer. 

SIR RALPH, after a moment. 

For testamentary purposes ? 

GRACE. 

Very likely. It was Mr. Lamb's idea to wire to you. 

SIR RALPH. 

What does he want me to do ? 

GRACE. 

I haven't the least idea. 

SIR RALPH. 

He shouldn't trifle (hesitating) with my habits ! I've not 
been here for years. 



26 THE ALBUM 

GRACE. 
Just five. Your last visit was the year I came. 

SIR RALPH. 

There have always been too many women. 

GRACE. 

Fve had the misfortune to be one of them. 

SIR RALPH. 

"One" is quite enough. In some cases, indeed, too 
much. I recognise — in general — your inevitable char- 
acter, but I hate to be the subject of manoeuvres. 

GRACE. 

It must be very odious. It has never been my fate. 

SIR RALPH. 

I can easily believe it. Keep out of them ! 

GRACE. 

We can each — for ourselves — abstain from them. 

SIR RALPH, looking at her hard an instant. 

That's exactly what I do ! I neither practise nor permit 

them. (Then after another instant, during which Grace gives a silent, 
decorous, but inexpressive movement of assent.) Have Other relations 

been summoned? 

GRACE. 
Others ? I think there are no others. 



ACT FIRST 27 

SIR RALPH, gratified, complacent. 

Only me ? There are persons remotely connected, but 
I appreciate the discrimination. 

GRACE. 

Mr. Lamb, last night, asked me a question. 

SIR RALPH. 

In regard to your personal pretensions ? 

GRACE, surprised. 
Mine ? (With genuine melancholy dignity.) What pretensionS 

have 7, Sir Ralph ? 

SIR RALPH. 

You're the sort of person who usually has extraordinary 

ones ! 

GRACE. 

How do you know what sort of person I am ? 

SIR RALPH. 

I admit that IVe been reduced to speculate. (After an 

instant, somewhat tentatively.) FvC WOUdercd, for inStaUCC, if 

you're paid. 

GRACE. 
For my work ? 

SIR RALPH. 

Or have only your bed and board. 

GRACE. 

And my washing? Let me relieve you. IVe had a 
salary. 



28 THE ALBUM 

SIR RALPH, relieved. 

Ah, that settles the question ! 

GRACE, vague. 

What question ? 

SIR RALPH. 

That of your expectations. You took them out in his 
life. 

GRACE. 

You speak as if his life were over ! 

SIR RALPH. 

An inadvertence. But from the moment the lawyers 
take the field — ! 

GRACE. 

It was to ask me about Mark Bernal. 

SIR RALPH, struck; vague an instant. 

Mark Bernal ? 

GRACE. 

Who was mentioned in an earlier will. 

SIR RALPH, thinking. 

Little Mark, shabby little Mark — whom I knew as a boy, 
a small boy when I was a big one : my cousin's cousin 

and my own cousin ? (With extreme emphasis and decision.) Why, 

all the world knows he's dead. 

GRACE. 

Mr. Lamb's aware of that rumour. 



ACT FIRST 29 

SIR RALPH. 
It ain't a rumour — it's a fact ! 

GRACE. 

Requiring proof. There are four thousand a year — 

SIR RALPH, breaking in. 

Four thousand a year ? 

GRACE. 

For somebody ! 

SIR RALPH, Vter an instant. 

Not for shabby little Mark ! 

GRACE. 

So it would appear. Mr. Bedford, last night, was not to 
be disturbed; so that Mr. Lamb's question was as to 
whether, during the five years I've lived here, I had 
heard of any communication from Mr. BernaL 

SIR RALPH, complacently affirmative. 

And you've heard of none ! 

GRACE. 

None whatever. 

SIR RALPH. 

Then that's the proof required. Mark's mother was a 
cousin of our cousin — that's the degree. 

GRACE. 

The same degree as your degree. 



30 THE ALBUM 

SIR RALPH, after an instant, as if reluctant to admit it. 
The same degree as mine. (Then with much more alacrity.) But 

a connection — undesirable. They were people of no 
position. 

GRACE, ironically dubious, surprised. 

Cousins of yours ? 

SIR RALPH, totally unconscious of her irony : candidly confidential. 

I never ran after them. The mother died, the father 
died, and Mark, who used to come here for his holidays, 
made a sad mess of his prospects. 

GRACE. 

Prospects ? What prospects ? 

SIR RALPH. 

A presumptive interest in the four thousand. He took 
to low courses ; I believe he took to painting portraits. 
He wore queer clothes and knew queer people. He 
was wild — I'm convinced he was wicked. His tastes 
were vulgar ; his abilities mean. He went tt) the bottom 
— he went to America. 

GRACE. 

Where — in the far west — he died, in a brawl, unap- 
preciated. 

SIR RALPH. 

But not uncommemorated. (After an instant.) The papers 
mentioned it. 



ACT FIRST 31 

GRACE. 
And if they hadn't ? 

SIR RALPH, pointing judiciously the moral. 

Why, he might have come in for something ! 

GRACE, turning away with a vague general sigh. 

It makes one hate them ! (Then seeing the Vicar, and addressing 
him, introducing Sir Ralph. Re-enter the Vicar from the outer hall, heated 
and breathless, still with Maud Vanneck's bag.) Sir Ralph Damant. 

THE VICAR. 

I missed you by crossing the fields ! 

SIR RALPH, distant, sarcastic, superior. 

I'm never to be found in the " fields " ! 

GRACE. 

Will you kindly inform Mr. Lamb ? 

THE VICAR. 

And what shall I do with the bag ? 

GRACE, amused, indicating indulgently a place to put it down. 

Part with it — there ! 

THE VICAR, depositing the bag with scrupulous care and extreme relief. 

There ! (Then up at the right.) I'll announce Sir Ralph. 

Exit the Vicar to the right. 
Re«enter from the outer hall Teddy Ashdown. 



32 THE ALBUM 

TEDDY, seeing the bag. 
He's back with it ? (Confidingly, familiarly, to both the others.) 

Such a chase ! 

SIR RALPH, struck with the elation of his tone and regarding the bag — 
conspicuously and showily a lady's — with cold suspicion. 

Pray, sir, is it yours ? 

GRACE. 

It belongs to Miss VannecL 

SIR RALPH. 

And who on earth's Miss Vanneck ? 

GRACE, up at the door to the outer hall, to Teddy. 

Your friends are in the park. Instruct Sir Ralph while 
I see about his room. 

Exit Grace Jesmond. 

TEDDY, artless, guileless ; producing his effects on Sir Ralph 
without intention. 

Fearfully clever girl, Miss Vanneck; she's had the 
Higher Education. 

SIR RALPH. 
Mercy ! 

TEDDY. 

A trained intelligence. She came with Lady Basset. 

SIR RALPH. 

And who on earth's Lady Basset ? 

TEDDY. 

Awfully sharp too. She's waiting for you. 



ACT FIRST 33 

SIR RALPH, dismayed. 

Waiting for me ? 

TEDDY. 

She was going ; but she stayed. 

SIR RALPH, echoing. 

Stayed ? 

TEDDY. 

On purpose to meet you. She knows you're the Heir ! 

SIR RALPH. 

Good God, Fm not the Heir ! 

TEDDY, surprised. 

You're not ? 

SIR RALPH. 

I am ; but it's none of her business 1 

TEDDY, innocently disconcerted. 

Mayn't I tell her, then ? 

SIR RALPH. 

Don't dream of it ! Be so good as to remain with me. 

TEDDY, who has gone to the long window. 

I was thinking of joining " dear Maud " ! 

SIR RALPH. 

The trained intelligence ? (As if with a hopeful thought.) Are 
you in love with it ? 

VOL. II D 



34 THE ALBUM 

TEDDY. 
I suppose that's what's the matter with me ! 

SIR RALPH. 

Then marry the creature ! 

TEDDY. 

She won't look at me ; she wants a decent fortune. 

SIR RALPH, after an instant. 

What does she call a decent fortune ? 

TEDDY. 

Four thousand a year. 

SIR RALPH, dismayed again. 

Four thousand ? 

TEDDY. 

She has fixed that figure. Of course I'm stone broke. 
My governor has stopped payment. 

SIR RALPH. 

Then make an effort — find something to do. 

TEDDY. 

That's exactly what I'm looking for ! 

SIR RALPH. 

Continue to look look hard ! (Then, as Tfddy seems restless.) 

And whatever you do, stay here ! (Encouraging, reassuring.) 
Sit down amuse yourself! (Looking round, nervously, for pretexts 



ACT FIRST 35 

for detaining, beguiling him, Sir Ralph's eye falls on Mark Bbrnal's album, 
which Lady Basset has placed on one of the tables and which he takes up.) 

I see you sketch. 

TED0Y, seated. 

Oh yes ; Fve the artistic nature. 

SIR RALPH 

Fall back on it ! 

TEDDY. 

I am falling ! I feel IVe a little gift that only requires 
direction. 

SIR RALPH. 
Then direct it ! (Turning over two or three pages of the album; 
patronisingly, commendingly.) I like the Steam-rollcr ! 

TEDDY, vague. 

What steam-roller ? 

SIR RALPH, passing him the open book. 

That one. 

TEDDY, with the album. 

It's not mine. (Looking at the cover.) It's awfully Hkc mine ! 

(Then on his feet again.) It beloUgS (turning to the flyleaf and reading) 

to " Mark Bernal" 

SIR RALPH, immensely startled. 

Mark Bernal ? 

TEDDY, unconscious of his start, continuing to read from the page. 

"Mark Bernal, Vandyke Lodge, Chelsea; September 

'91." (Then glancing again at the outside of the album.) A joUy 

new book. 



36 THE ALBUM 

SIR RALPH, taking it back from Teddy's hand and repeating, in his 
guarded amazement,' interrogatively, but mechanically. 

A jolly new book ? 

TEDDY. 

Dated last month. Who is Mark Bernal ? 

SIR RALPH, who has stared hard a moment at the name on the flyleaf, 
and then, looking up, presented a pale, alarmed, conjectural face. 

I haven't the least idea ! 

TEDDY, to whom, recovering himself with a great effort, and as if it doesn't 
matter or mean anything to him, he has surrendered the album again. 

Somebody has left it. (Then reverting to the drawing of which Sir 

Ralph has spoken.) By Jovc, I'll co/y the Steamroller ! 

SIR RALPH, uneasy, as Teddy, with the album under his arm, 
goes to the long window. 

Where are you going ? 

TEDDY. 

To join the ladies ! 

Exit Teddy Ashdown, with the album, to the park. 
SIR RALPH, alone, deeply agitated, wonderstruck. 

Mark Bernal — last month ? Here, and nobody knows ? 

(Then, to himself, seeing the Vicar reappear: re-enter the Vicar from the 
right.) Will ^ know ? (To the Vicar, eager.) My COUSin's 

worse ? 

THE VICAR, with a memorandum in his hand. 

He keeps up — for Mr. Lamb — but the doctor deprecates 
his seeing you. Therefore I'm desired by Mr. Lamb 
to put you an important question. 



^, 



ACT FIRST 37 

SIR RALPH, nervous, anxious. 

An important question ? 

THE VICAR, highly responsible and a little embarrassed. 

Confided to my discretion— on the subject of a relative. 

SIR RALPH, more guarded. 

A relative ? 

THE VICAR, who has again consulted his memoraiidum ; looking at Sir 
Ralph, while his pencil taps his chin, over his glasses. 

Mr. Mark Moorsom Bernal. 

SIR RALPH, silent, motionless a moment ; then, with intensely studi'jd 
collectedness, while he sees Grace J Esmond reappear. 

What of Mr. Mark Moorsom Bernal ? 

Re-enter, as he speaks, Grace Jesmond from the outer hall, with several open 
letters in her hand. 

THE VICAR. 

He's believed not to be living. 

SIR RALPH, while Gkacr, who on recognising the manner in which ihey 
are engaged, has first stopped short and then, on reflection, come down 
discreetly on the side of the stage opposite Sir Ralph's and remained 
there effacing herself and waiting ; only looking over her letters. 



BeHeved — universally 



THE VICAR, referring again to his paper. 

Mr. Bedford has taken it for granted ! But it has 
occurred to him, for his completer satisfaction, to cause 
it to be inquired of you, while he has still power to 
inquire, if any intimation to the contrary — (Pausing scmpu- 

lously an instant, smiling bland'y. explanatorily at Grace.) 



38 THE ALBUM 

SIR RALPH. 

If any intimation to the contrary — ? 

THE VICAR. 

Has lately reached your ears. 



SIR RALPH, after a moment, during which his eyes have met Grace's, 
raised from her letters fixedly to his own in consequence of the Vicar's 
invitation to her. 

No intimation to the contrary has ever reached my ears. 



THE VICAR, appreciative, satisfied, folding up his paper. 
Most definite ; thank you. (Then to Grace, sentimentally, pro- 
fessionally.) Awfully sad ! 

GRACE, grave. 

Awfully ! (Then to Sir Ralph.) I came back to tell you 
that your apartment is ready for you — the King's Room, 
as we call it. As I've pressing letters to answer (indicating 
the library) perhaps the Vicar will kindly take you to it. 



SIR RALPH, reluctant to leave the room and with an uneasy movement 
looking covertly about him as if still preoccupied with the rapid disappear- 
ance, the whereabouts, of the album. 

I won't trouble the Vicar. I remember the King's Room. 



THE VICAR, up at the right, obliging, punctilious. 

Off the main gallery — three steps ! 

Exit the Vicar to the right. 
Re-enter Lady Basset by the long window. 



ACT FIRST 39 

GRACE, at the door of the library. 

I leave you then to Lady Basset ! 

Exit GsACB to the library. 
LADY BASSET, breathless. 

Mr. Ashdown has just told me it's you who are Sir 
Ralph ! 

SIR RALPH, staring, unapproachable. 

Pray who else should it be ? 

LADY BASSET, as if with relief and rapture. 

1 like you the better of the two ! 

SIR RALPH, blank. 

Of which two ? 

LADY BASSET. 

Why, there's a gentleman passing for you ! 

SIR RALPH, aghast. 

Passing for me ? 

LADY BASSET. 

Passing for the Heir — it's the same thing ! 

SIR RALPH, after an instant. 

Possibly ! (After another instant.) Where is this gentleman ? 

LADY BASSET. 

You must ask Miss Vanneck ; she has designs on him. 

SIR RALPH. 

Designs ? 



40 THE ALBUM 

LADY BASSET. 

Matrimonial. Fancy her crudity ! 

SIR RALPH. 
I can easily fancy it ! But if he isn't me, who may this 
person be ? 

LADY BASSET. 

Ask the man ! It's enough for me that you are you ! 

SIR RALPH. 
It's enough for you, madam ; but it's sometimes too 
much for myself! Your news is not agreeable to me, 
and I beg you to permit me to retire. 

LADY BASSET. 
You're going to your room? Allow me to show you 
the way ! 

SIR RALPH. 
I know the way. (Then to settle the matter— keep her quiet.) Off 

the main gallery — three steps. 

LADY BASSET, delighted. 

Three steps ? So is mine ! I'm going to mine. 

SIR RALPH, after an instant. 

Then 1 remain. When did this scoundrel arrive ? 

LADY BASSET. 

But a moment, I judge, before yourself. 



ACT FIRST 41 

SIR RALPH. 
And who else has seen him ? 

LADY BASSET. 

No one but Miss Vanneck. 

SIR RALPH. 

Not Miss Jesmond? 

LADY BASSET. 

Not Miss Jesmond. She^s remiss ! 

SIR RALPH, looking at his watch. 

What's his appearance ? 

LADY BASSET. 

Very fine, I'm bound to confess. (Then significantly.) But 
yoii can hold your own, Sir Ralph ! 

SIR RALPH. 
I pass my life, madam, in trying to ! Is this interloper 
plausible — ^artful ? 

LADY BASSET, after an instant. 

Artful — ^in a sense. He cultivates art ! 

SIR RALPH, struck. 

He draws — he paints ? 

LADY BASSET. 

In a style of his own. He had an album. (Looking about 
her.) It was here. 



42 THE ALBUM 

SIR RALPH, precipitate. 
I haven't seen it ! (Then after a moment's intense and troubled 
thought ; breaking out frankly and abruptly.) Will yOU grant me 3L 

favour, madam? 

LADY BASSET, radiant. 

Every favour a woman can ! 

SIR RALPH. 

One is enough. Simply not to mention that Tve asked 
you these questions. 

LADY BASSET, struck, diplomatic, considering. 

Not to "mention" it? 

SIR RALPH. 

To forget our conversation. 

LADY BASSET. 
That will surely be difficult ! (Then after reflection.) What 

do you offer me for this failure of memory ? 

SIR RALPH. 

" Offer " you ? My gratitude, madam — my enlightened 
esteem. 

LADY BASSET. 

" Esteem," Sir Ralph, is rather cold. The price of dis- 
cretion is always high. (Then, smiling, as he appears to demur.) 

A woman's silence, you know, comes dear ! 



ACT FIRST 43 

SIR RALPH. 

There's nothing in life so expensive. Therefore I don't 
haggle with you. I extend to you my personal regard. 

LADY BASSET, arch. 

How " personal " are you prepared to make it ? 

SIR RALPH, after a moment. 

My opportunities shall show you. 

LADY BASSET. 

I await the demonstration ! 

SIR RALPH. 

On the distinct understanding — ? 

LADY BASSET. 

It's (oiyou to treat it as one ! 

SIR RALPH, at the door to the outer hall as that of the library opens. 

Then I begin. Silence to /i^r/ 

Exit Sir Ralph rapidly. Re-enter Grace Jbsmond from the library. 

LADY BASSET, disconcerted, blank. 

Does he call that " beginning " ? (Then in a totally diflferent tone 
to Gracb, who has two sealed and stamped letters which she takes straight up 

to the big letter-box of the house.) Sir Ralph's adorable ! 

GRACE, after an instant, as she posts her letters. 

Adorable ! 

LADY BASSET. 

And Mr. Bedford ? 



44 THE ALBUM 

GRACE, coming down. 

He keeps up. 

LADY BASSET, with a shade of disappointment. 

No alteration ? 

GRACE. 

None whatever. 

LADY BASSET, after an instant. 

When it comes, please let me know. 

Exit Lady Basset to the outer hall. 
Re-enter Tbddy Ashoown, with the album, by the long window. 
GRACE, kind, as she sees the album. 

Have you been sketching? 

TEDDY, discouraged. 

Fve been looking for " dear Maud " ! 

GRACE. 
All in vain ? 

TEDDY. 

High and low. IVe no heart for the steam-roller ! 

GRACE, vague. 

The steam-roller? 

TEDDY, holding out the album, which Grace takes. 

There's one in there. You should send it after him. 



After whom ? 
Mark Bernal. 
Mark Bernal? 



ACT FIRST 
GRACE. 

TEDDY. 

GRACE, blank. 



AS 



TEDDY. 
There's his address. (Then as he perceives her surprise.) He 

hasn't been here ? 

GRACE, who has opened the book and turned to the flyleaf; staring, 
astounded, at the inscription. 

Been here ? He's dead ! 



TEDDY, bewildered. 



"Dead?" 



GRACE, with all her mystification, but a dawning relief and pleasure 
almost a cry of exultation. 

He's alive ! (Then as she rapidly turns the book over.) Where did 

you get this ? 

TEDDY. 
From Sir Ralph Damant. 



GRACE, struck. 



Sir Ralph Damant? 



TEDDY, increasingly surprised at her emotion, at the importance she 
appears to attach to the circumstance. 

He gave it to me. (indicating the table.) He picked it up 
there. 



46 THE ALBUM 

GRACE, staring. 

There ? How did it come there ? 

TEDDY. 

Blessed if I know ! No more did he, 

GRACE. 

Did he see this name ? 

TEDDY. 

I read it out — I showed it to him. 
GRACE. 

And what did he say ? 

TEDDY. 

He said he didn't know the person. 

GRACE, after a moment. 

How long ago was this ? 

TEDDY, looking at his watch. 

Before I went out — half an hour. 

GRACE. 

Are you certain ? 

TEDDY. 

Certain ! I noticed the clock. 

GRACE, who has stood a moment intensely wondering and thinking, then has 
gone up impulsively to the right with the album and, checking herself, come 
down again. 



Can you keep the secret ? 



ACT FIRST 47 

TEDDY. 
Is it a secret ? 

GRACE. 

Make it one ! Tell no one you've seen this. 

TEDDY. 

But Sir Ralph knows I have. 

GRACE. 

And you know he has. That*s why I want you to be 
dumb. 

TEDDY, staring. 

But if he speaks ? 

GRACE. 

He won't speak ! 

TEDDY. 

Then /won't! 

GRACE. 
Thank you ! (Then, while Mark Bbrnal, unseen by either, reappears : 
re-enter Mark Bbrnal by the long window.) NoW gO tO MisS 

Vanneck ! 

BERNAL, smiling, coming down. 

You'll find her beyond the village, sketching the old 

mill ! (Then while the others, startled, stare at him interrogatively, he goes 
on, after an inclination to Grace, soothingly and sociably.) I pOSted her 

there with a block and a pencil 

TEDDY, precipitate. 

Then Pll join her ! 



Exit Tbddy by the long window. 



48 THE ALBUM 

BERNAL. Ihuikly, amicably. 

I see you have my album ; but I had fortunately in my 
overcoat pocket another string to my bow ! 

GRACE, after a moment, breathless, amazed. 

Are you Mark Moorsom Bemal ? 

BERNAL, assenting, smiling. 

hx^you Grace Jesmond? 

GRACE, surinised, touched. 

What do you know of Grace Jesmond, Mr. Bemal ? 

BERNAL. 
What those ladies, what my brilliant pupil out there, 
have been so good as to tell me. 

GRACE. 

You've seen them — ^you've had time to talk with them ? 

BERNAL. 

They received me when I came. 

GRACE. 
And when on earth did you come — and whence ? 

BERNAL. 

From London — an hour ago. To find a troubled 
house I 

GRACE. 

Mr. Bedford's very ill — and unaware of your presence. 



ACT FIRST 
BERNAL. 

I've been taken for some one else ! 

GRACE. 

Sir Ralph Damant? He has just arrived. 

BERNAL. 

Will he see me ? 

GRACE, after an instant. 

It would surprise him to do so ! He thinks yoi 
dead. 

BERNAL, struck, smiling, penitent. 

That's one for my bad manners ! 

GRACE, kind, impulsive. 

Your manners seem good enough ! (Then after an inst

GRACE. 
Surely you're aware of the fewness of your relatives. 

BERNAL. 

IVe been conscious mainly of a different order of priva- 
tion ! 

GRACE. 
The only person interested, as they say, is Sir Ralph. 

BERNAL. 

And you, Miss Jesmond — are you not interested ? 

GRACE, surprised. 

I, Mr. Bernal ? (Then after an instant.) I'm a Servant ! 

BERNAL. 

A servant ? 

GRACE. 

I mean that Fve done my work and had my wage. And 
in that useful capacity, by your leave, I should announce 
your arrival to Mr. Bedford. 

BERNAL, demurring. 

Let him learn it, please, at his convenience. 

GRACE. 
Do you think nothing of your own ? 



ACT FIRST 51 

BERNAL, vague. 



My own ? 

GRACE. 

With his weakness — time presses. 



BERNAL. 

If he's so weak, why worry him? Tve neglected him 
too long to have rights. 

GRACE. 
I happen to know that he has had your rights in mind. 

BERNAL. 

Then he'll leave me something ! 

GRACE. 

Unfortunately he supposes that they've lapsed. But 
from the moment that lapse is repaired — 

BERNAL, breaking in. 

He'll "remember" me, as they say? I don't want to 
be remembered as a beggar ! 

GRACE. 
You're no more a beggar than others ! 

BERNAL, vague. 

What others ? 

GRACE. 

There are people who are not here for sentiment 



52 THE ALBUM 

BERNAL. 
You take a kind view of me, Miss Jesmond. 

GRACE, after an instant; fnnk. 

I want you not to be sacrificed. 

BERNAL. 

It would convey a startling suggestion of my being good 
for something ! I smoke pretty much everywhere, but 
I've never smoked on the altar ! 

GRACE. 

If you're not serious now, I'm afraid you'll never be I 

BERNAL, sympathetic, emphatic. 

Yes — on the day I can do something to contribute to 
your interests ! Please believe that I'm deeply touched 
by the attention you give to mine. 

GRACE, after an instant, taking again from a table the album which at the 
beginning of the scene she has laid on it. 

Do you know how to acknowledge it ? (Then as he stares 
while she holds up the book.) By giving me this. 

BERNAL, blank. 

" Giving " it to you ? 

GRACE. 

Letting me keep it. 

BERNAL, assenting with mystified amusement. 

For all it's worth ' 



ACT FIRST 53 

GRACE. 

We'll see what it's worth. (Then moving to go.) But every 
moment counts. 

BERNAL. 

Because he's failing ? 

GRACE.

BERNAL. 

If the shock may hurt him, I decline the responsibility I 

GRACE, at the door to the right. 

Then I'll take it! 

Exit Gracb with the album. 
BERNAL, alone. 

What an interesting crisis — and what an attractive 
woman ! 

Re-enter Sir Ralph Damant from the outer hall, precipitate, headlong in his 
discomposure. 

SIR RALPH, with an agitated grievance that breaks out, beyond any other 
preoccupation, to the first person he sees. 

Is there no place in the house that's safe from her? 

BERNAL, vague. 

From Miss Jesmond ? 

SIR RALPH. 

From Lady Basset ! (Then startled, with a wild stare.) Hcavens ! 
are you Mark Bernal ? 

BERNAL, smiling. 

Did you know I was here ? 



54 THE ALBUM 

SIR RALPH. 
Never in the world ! But your face comes back to me. 

BERNAL. 

I thought you thought I was dead. 

SIR RALPH. 

You played the part so well ! 

BERNAL. 

I indeed forgot the " house " ! But I now feel as if I 
were making my bow to it — though Vm not wholly sure 

Fve had a call ! (Then after another look at Sir Ralph.) YoU 

don't look, cousin, as if the call had come from you / 

SIR RALPH. 

Fm not fond of theatricals : I go in for the real thing. 
Why have we been elaborately deceived ? 

BERNAL. • 

Because that was the scale of your credulity ! I did 
engage, at Portland, Oregon, in a silly row, from an 
honourable motive, a motive with a funny accent, but 
with lovely appealing eyes. I interfered, in other words, 
in a domestic discussion, in the settlement of which I 
was left for dead on the field. 

SIR RALPH. 

It served you right ; you interfered on the wrong side ! 



ACT FIRST 55 

BERNAL. 
That was the opinion of the lively local press, which, in 
huge headlines, pointed the moral of my error. It 
therefore remained silent when I at last picked myself 
up, for my recovery was a different reading of the lesson. 

SIR RALPH. 

You might have given us a sign ! 

BERNAL. 

A sign of what ? That I was an ass ? You had let me 
suspect you knew it already ! 

SIR RALPH. 

Yet you've faced us to-day. 

BERNAL. 

It has taken me a month — since my return — to make 
up my mind to it ! 

SIR RALPH. 

You brought tack a fortune ? 

BERNAL. 

Of exactly five pounds ! 

SIR RALPH. 

Don't you practise your trade ? 

BERNAL. 

Of which of my trades do you speak ? I've tried too 
many — I've wasted my time ! 



56 THE ALBUM 

SIR RALPH. 

YouVe been dissolute ? 

BERNAL. 

I've been universal ! 

SIR RALPH. 

Then you're not a painter ? 

BERNAL. 

The critics say so ; but I can't afford to believe them. 
I've returned to my early faith ! 

SIR RALPH. 

Taking portraits ? 

BERNAL, amused. 

At so much a head ! 

SIR RALPH. 

How much ? 

BERNAL, looking at him an instant ; then jocular. 

A thousand pounds ! (Sir Ralph gives a gesture of solemn dismay, 
and at the same moment Bernal sees Maud Vannbck. Re-enter Maud Van- 
neck by the long window ; on which Bernal continues, indicating her sociably.) 

My portraits are dear, but Miss Vanneck can tell you for 
how little I give lessons ! 

MAUD, to Bernal, coming down eagerly. 

Introduce me ! 



ACT FIRST 57 

SIR RALPH, still more peremptory. 



Don^t ! 



BERNAL, with a humorous want of mercy and the gesture of presenting. 

Sir Ralph Damant — my favourite pupil ! 

MAUD, arch and engaging, to Sir Ralph. 

If he's nothing but a drawing-master, you must forgive 
my mistaking him at first for you ! 

BERNAL. 

Now that your error is righted, I expect to be completely 
neglected ! 

SIR RALPH, much disconcerted and disgusted, turning his back on Maud. 

You should keep your favourites in hand ! (Then seeing 

Lady Basset : re-enter Lady Basset from the outer hall.) Ain't shc a 

favourite too ? For God's sake keep ?ier ! 

LADY BASSET, who has removed her hat and exchanged her travelling- 
dress for something very smart and advantageous ; smiling significantly at 
Sir Ralph. 

You see IVe taken off my things ! 

MAUD, presenting, with an undiscouraged smile, the sleeve of her jacket to 
Sir Ralph. 

Sir Ralph himself will kindly take off mine ! 

Sir Ralph makes a gesture of incorruptible austerity, and Teddy Ashdown, at 
the moment Maud speaks, re-enters by the long window. 

TEDDY, rushing forward, xissLsting Maud. 

I say — that's my privilege ! 



58 THE ALBUM 

MAUD, provoked at Sir Ralph and in her petulance thrusting at Teddy a 
long pin taken from her dress. 

Then keep this pin ! 

TEDDY, wounded by the pin and giving a start, a sharp cry while Grace 
Jbsmond reappears. 

Aie! 

Re-enter Gracb Jesmond from the right. 
GRACE, on one side of the stage while Bbrnal is on the other. 

IVe been with the Doctor, Mr. Bernal. (Then, after an 

instant, grave, as the Vicar reappears : re-enter the Vicar from the right.) 

He sends the Vicar with a request. 

THE VICAR, flurried and formal as before, addressing them all. 

I request your indulgence for my errand. The Doctor 
considers that a high standard of tranquillity has not 
been successfully maintained. 

BERNAL, solicitous, precipitate. 

Of course we're an awful nuisance — do tell him I'll go 
this moment ! 

GRACE, promptly interposing. 

Mr. Bernal — please remain ! 

THE VICAR. 

We must part — reluctantly! — with those whoVe so 
conscientiously — 

GRACE, helping him out. 

Misconceived their duty. Lady Basset and Miss Van- 
neck will find a carriage at the door. 



ACT FIRST 59 

LADY BASSET, deeply disconcerted and disgusted, looks resentfully from 
Grack J ESMOND to the Vicar ; then with the movement of accepting under 
compulsion an odious necessity, turns expressively to Sir Ralph. 

We're separated by violence — but I return to take leave 
of you ! 

Exit Lady Bassst to the outer hall. 
MAUD, playfully, to Sir Ralph. 

Not even violence, if a single word — 

SIR RALPH. 

A single word ? Farewell ! 

MAUD, in the same way. 

Ah, that ts violence ! 

TEDDY, with frank alacrity, to Grace. 

I'll also go in the carriage. 

GRACE. 

A moment, Mr. Ashdown. (Then alter an instant.) Sir 
Ralph, can we part with Mr. Ashdown ? 



SIR RALPH, struck and surprised, mystified and alarmed by her tone ; but 
presently replying with an impenetrable face. 

If I may answer for myself — without a pang ! 



GRACE, kind, to Tkddv. 

See to your things then, and coriie back and take leave 
of us ! 



6o THE ALBUM 

TEDDY, who has been admiring Maud's sketching-block, looking sociably 
at Bbrnau 

I hate to take leave of Mr. Bemal, because I want him 
to give me a lesson. 

BERNAL, vague, good-humoured. 

A lesson ? 

TEDDY. 

In Miss Vanneck's class 1 

BERNAL, assenting amicably ; amused. 

Look me up in town. 

TEDDY, highly pleased. 

In town ! 

Exit Teddy to the outer hall with the sketching-block. 
THE VICAR. 

The Doctor consents that Sir Ralph and Mr. Bernal 
shall each see his patient 

SIR RALPH, taking instant precedence. 

Then I go ! 

GRACE, arresting him. 

A moment, Sir Ralph ! (To bernal.) Mr. Bernal, you go 

first. (Then as Bernal hesitates, indicating Sir Ralph's prior right.) Fvc 

something to say to Sir Ralph. 

THE VICAR, to Bernal at the door to the right. 

This way ! 

BERNAL, to Grace, grave, hesitating. 

Will he know me ? 



ACT FIRST 6i 

GRACE. 
Try! 

BERNAL, at the door to the right ; his eyes on her with the same seriousness. 

I'll try ! 

Exeunt Mark Bbrnal and the Vicar. 
GRACE, after an instant. 

The will's made ! 

SIR RALPH, staring. 

Then what's the use of Mark's going ? 

GRACE. 

It's not too late to make another. 

SIR RALPH. 

He'll hold out? 

GRACE. 

The Doctor hopes so — with the sight of Mr. Bernal. 

SIR RALPH. 

Sufficiently to make the effort — ? 

GRACE. 

After a rest — ^to-morrow. 

SIR RALPH, stupefied ; artless. 

He'll live till to-morrow ? 

GRACE. 

Possibly much longer — with care. There must of course 
be no drawback. 



62 THE ALBUM 

SIR RALPH. 
Won't it be a drawback to see Mark ? 

GRACE. 

It will be a great joy. The drawback will be the sense 
of his mistake. 

SIR RALPH, as if vague. 

His mistake ? 

GRACE. 
His failure — an hour ago — to be aware that, at the very 
moment he consented to accept as certified the death of 
a possible legatee, that legatee, by the most extraordi- 
nary of chances, had passed through his house and 
might, but for a fatality, have stood beside his bed ! 

SIR RALPH. 
A fatality ? 

GRACE. 

That of his having escaped observation. 

SIR RALPH, conscious, but very emphatic. 

Completely ! 

GRACE. 

And left no sign of his presence. 

SIR RALPH, with the same serene assurance. 
None at all ! (Grace, with an irrepressible nervous movement, turns 

away at this, and he goes on.) So that our poor friend did accept 
my cousin's death as certified ? 



ACT FIRST 63 

GRACE. 
With your attestation to sustain him, how could he do 
less? 

SIR RALPH, complacent. 

My attestation was unconscious of its fallacy ! 

GRACE. 

Just as poor Mr. Bernal was unconscious of your at- 
testation ! 

SIR RALPH. 

A fellow shouldn't really do such things ! 
GRACE. 

Return so unexpectedly ? 

SIR RALPH. 
After having vanished so finally. 

GRACE. 
There's no doubt he has behaved very ill ; so that if 
Mr. Bedford does hold out, he'll come off better than 
he deserves ! 

SIR RALPH. 

And if Mr. Bedford passes away — ? 

GRACE. 

Don't the actual dispositions take effect ? 

SIR RALPH, thinking an instant ; then just a shade rueful. 

Unless Mark fights. 



64 THE ALBUM 

GRACE. 

Oh, he may fight ! 

SIR RALPH, prompt. 

Do you think he will ? 

GRACE. 

That would depend on his suspicion of how narrowly he 
had missed his luck ! 

SIR RALPH, considering, as if objecting to the expression. 

How "narrowly"? 

GRACE. 

He might guess that it had hung by a hair. 

SIR RALPH. 

What do you call a hair ? 

GRACE. /^ 

Why, your fatal answer to the Vicar. v^-.^^^^^^^^^"^ 

SIR RALPH. 

If it was fatal, madam, it was at least perfectly natural. 

GRACE, after an instant. 

So is Mr. BernaPs disappointment ! 

SIR RALPH, as if with forced and resentful resignation to her 
obj ectionableness. 

Which it's in your power, doubtless, to exacerbate ! 



ACT FIRST 65 

GRACE, quiet. 

I don't know what's in my power, Sir Ralph ! We 
never know till we try. 

SIR RALPH. 

Your threats are in shocking taste, if Mr. Bedford's to 
make another will ! 

GRACE. 

Let us take that quite for granted ! (At the door of the library.) 
And now I must go back to my letters. 

SIR RALPH. 

Before you do so you'll perhaps let me know the motive 

of this extraordinary aggression. (Then more defiant as, with 
her hand on the door of the library, Gracb only stands looking fixedly at him.) 

What the mischief do you mean by it ? 

GRACE, after a moment more of the same significant and expressive attitude. 

Can't you guess ? 

Exit Grace Jesmond. 

SIR RALPH, alone, staring, wondering; then as if with a sudden vision of 
the truth. 

By all that's portentous, I can guess 1 She wants to make 

me propose ! (Then eager, as he sees Mark Beknal : re-enter Mark 

Bernal from the right.) Did he know you ? 

BERNAL. 

The Doctor thought so. He stared for a long moment, 
dear man — ^then he closed his kind eyes. 

VOL. II V 



66 THE ALBUM 

SIR RALPH, in suspense. 

Is he much weaker ? 

BERNAL. 

About the same. 

SIR RALPH. 

Then he'll go on ? 

BERNAL, confident. 

If all goes well. 

SIR RALPH, considering; then after an instant. 

And Tm to go up now ? 

BERNAL, looking at his watch. 

At one, please. (Looking round him.) Where's Miss Jesmond ? 

SIR RALPH. 

She has left me, thank God ! 

BERNAL, surprised. 

Why abnormal gratitude ? 

SIR RALPH. 

P'or miraculous relief. She wants to marry me. She's 
like the others. 

BERNAL. 

The others ? 

SIR RALPH. 

The old woman and the girl. They've marked me, you 
know. But Miss Jesmond has marked me biggest. 



ACT FIRST 67 

BERNAL, 



In bright red chalk ? 

SIR RALPH, with a nervous wriggle. 

I feel it between the shoulders ! She's an intrigante'-&lt;i{ 
a peculiarly dangerous type. 

BERNAL. 

Why, I thought her so charming ! 

SIR RALPH. 

She has made up to you too ? 

BERNAL, smiling. 

Like the others ! 

SIR RALPH. 

She's a hungry adventuress. 

BERNAL. • 

With me it doesn't matter ; I'm not worth their powder. 

SIR RALPH. 

Because you're poor ? 

BERNAL. 

Because I'm nobody. 

SIR RALPH. 

Be duly grateful. It protects you. 

BERNAL. 

My dear man, I like danger ! 



68 THE ALBUM 

SIR RALPH. 
You don't kncnv it ! To know it, you must be exposed. 

BERNAL. 

I see — even as you are. 

SIR RALPH. 

My position is one of the highest peril 

BERNAL. 

You're a match, a catch, a swell : you pay for it ! 

SIR RALPH. 

I pay too much and too often. I pay with my comfort, 
my health, my nerves ! My nerves are gone to pieces 
— I live in a state of siege ! 

BERNAL. 

But you seem to hold out. 

SIR RALPH. 

There are very serious breaches. It's the modem 
methods of attack — they've reduced it to a science. 

BERNAL. 

Lady Basset's a kind of Moltke ? 

SIR RALPH. 

And Miss Jesmond's a kind of Armstrong ! I vow I'm 
doomed to fall ! 



ACT FIRST 69 

BERNAL. 

My dear fellow, don't you desire to fall ? 

SIR RALPH. 

At my own time, in my own place — not in the din of 
battle, amid the yells of victory. 

BERNAL. 

I enjoy the din of battle ; and the yells of victory have 
only to come from pretty lips — ! 

SIR RALPH. 

Do you mean you actually like women ? 

BERNAL. 

It sounds dreadful, but I should be a brute if I didn't. 
They've been my consolation. 

SIR RALPH. 

They're the luxury of the poor ! You can afford natural 
pleasures. You ought to recognise the fact that your 
limitations are your liberty. 

BERNAL. 

The liberty to love ? May I never lose it ! 

SIR RALPH. 

I shall be glad to assist you to retain it. Remain 
exactly as you are, and you will. 



70 THE ALBUM 

BERNAL. 
Tm afraid there's very little doubt that I shall remain 
exactly as I am. I always have remained exactly as I 
am ! You make me feel indeed a sort of eternal tableau 
vivanty and inspire me to positively decline to rise. But 
while I luxuriate in my limitations, as you so happily 
describe them, what on earth will become oiyou ? 

SIR RALPH. 

I shall probably succumb to the mockery of my advan- 
tages and the ferocity of my pursuers. 

BERNAL. 

The real way to escape, my dear man, is to marry. 

SIR RALPH, with a start. 

Marry whom ? 

BERNAL, diverted, staring. 

Any one you like ! 

SIR RALPH, with his hand to his heart. 

I thought you meant Miss Jesmond ! (Giving him his hand.) 
See how my pulse throbs ! 

BERNAL, feeling the hand while Sir Ralph pants. 

You're indeed a wreck ! 

SIR RALPH, instinctively, unconsciously wiping his hand with his pocket- 
handkerchief and going on argumentatively. 

You say "any one I like." But I don't like any one ! 
I hate them all, and yet they're always wM me ! 



ACT FIRST 71 

BERNAL, after looking at him an instant with amused compassion. 

Let me help you ! 

SIR RALPH. 

Upon my soul, I think you ought ! YouVe the happy 
lot — the ideal life ; you owe something to others ! 

BERNAL. 

But what can I do ? 

SIR RALPH. 

Draw the assailants off — ^keep them at bay ! 

BERNAL, considering, responding, entering into it 

While you gain time — ^get away ? Happy thought ! I'll 
do what I can : I'll cover your retreat. 

SIR RALPH. 

I count upon you ! And your profit, your reward — 

BERNAL, taking the words out of his mouth, gaily expressing the idea. 

Will be in the very nature of the task — the exercise of 
my essential freedom ! 

SIR RALPH, pleased, patronising. 

The exercise, say, of your characteristic genius ! (Then 
after an instant) In retum for this relief I should be willing 
to entertain the idea of (hesitating a moment) a formal acknow- 
ledgment. 

BERNAL, vague. 

A formal acknowldgment ? 



72 THE ALBUM 

SIR RALPH. 
Pecuniary ! (Complacent.) You may paint my portrait 

BERNAL. 

Delighted. You're a great subject ! 

SIR RALPH. 

But not for a thousand. 

BERNAL, smilbg. 

For how much ? 

SIR RALPH, debating an instant ; then with the same complacency. 

For a hundred. 

BERNAL, with the same good-humour. 
For a hundred. (Then while Grace Jesmond reappears.) When 

will you sit ? 

Re-enter Gracb Jbsmond from the library, with more addxessed and 
stamped letters. 

SIR RALPH, privately, with intensity, to Brrnal. 

" Sit ? " I can only run ! Cover my retreat ! 

Exit Sir Ralph hastily to the right. 
GRACE, eager ; keeping her letters. 

Did Mr. Bedford know you ? 

BERNAL, smUmg, kind. 

I think I was mysterious to him — very much as you are 
to me/ (Then after an instant) Are you greatly attached to 
him? 



ACT FIRST 73 

GRACE. 
He has been good to me. IVe been of use to him, and 
this beautiful place has been my home. 

BERNAL. 

Shall you leave it — after this ? 

GRACE. 

Naturally I shall leave it. With regret ! 

BERNAL. 

And where shall you go ? 

GRACE. 

I don't know, Mr. Bernal, where I shall go. 

BERNAL. 

Have you no friends ? 

GRACE. 

We don't know what friends we have till we test them. 

BERNAL. 

And have you none of yours whom youVe tested ? 

GRACE, smiling. 

I give people the benefit of doubts ! 

BERNAL. 

Don't be too fond of doubts. Try a little confidence ! 



74 THE ALBUM 

GRACE. 
I daresay I shall have to from this time. You must set 
me the example ! 

BERNAL. 

Is there anything I can do for you — offer you ? 

GRACE, as if much touched, but smiling, and with a certain gentle mockery. 

You speak as if you were powerful ! 

BERNAL. 

You do right to take me up on it. My situation is 
preposterous — there's indeed no service I can render. 

GRACE. 

Your situation will change — and then youll become 
conscious of your power. 

BERNAL. 

Even if I do, I don't think I shall believe in it. The 
only thing I've ever believed in is my freedom ! 

GRACE, after an instant. 

Is freedom very sweet ? 

BERNAL. 

Have you never known it ? 

GRACE. 

Perhaps I shall know it now. 



ACT FIRST 75 

BERNAL. 

If I lose mine, I shall take a tremendous interest in 
yours. 

GRACE. 

You're very kind — but you'll lose nothing. The best 
freedom is to be rich ! 

BERNAL. 

Why are you so bent, Miss Jesmond, on my being 
"rich"? 

GRACE, with genuine intensity. 

Because it costs me too much, here, to-day, to believe 
you're too late ! 

BERNAL, gallant. 

Never too late when in time to see you ! (Then as Lady 
Basset reappears.) And the rest of this woudcrful Company I 

Re-enter Lady Basset from the outer hall, again fully equipped for departure. 
LADY BASSET, eager. 

Sir Ralph's not here ? 

BERNAL. 

He's with our cousin. 

LADY BASSET, in the same manner. 

The will's made ? 

GRACE. 

The will's made. 



76 THE ALBUM 

LADY BASSET. 

And what does he get ? 

GRACE, after an instant. 

He gets everything ! 

Re-enter Maud Vannbck from the outer hall. 

LADY BASSET, in the excitement and effusion of the news ; inadvertent, 
to Maud. 

He gets everything ! 

Re-enter Tbddy Ashdown, dressed to go, with the two bags. 

MAUD, excited. 
Everything? Crhen passing on the news to Teddy.) He getS 

everything ! 

TEDDY, staring. 

Everything ? 

MAUD, enthusiastic 

Everything ! 

LADY BASSET, re-echoing, jubilant 

Everything ! 

Re-enter from the right, as she speaks, Sir Ralph Damant, pale and grave, 
who pauses in the doorway at the sight and sound of these demonstrations, 
with outstretched, warning, commanding hands. 

SIR RALPH, with stem authority. 

Ladies and gentlemen, we're in a house of mourning. 
Our generous host and kinsman has passed away ! 



ACT SECOND 

Mark Bernal's studio, Vandyke Lodge, Chelsea ; a bare, im- 
pecunious, but more or less shabbily-picturesque room, furnished with 
odds and ends and with various signs of a roving past, hand-to-mouth, 
picnicking habits and a Bohemian manner of life : not vulgar, how- 
ever ; only unconventional and casual. The right side is occupied by 
the high glazed studio north-light. At the centre, toward the right, 
the door to the so-called parlour. At the centre, toward the left, the 
door to street, opening first into a small vestibule. Down on the left 
the door to the kitchen and the pantry. Under the big window an 
old faded, battered Chippendale sofa. Down on the left an old- 
fashioned but dilapidated " property" chair with a small table beside 
it. Up at the centre, between the two doors, a bare chimney-piece 
with an unframed picture above it and a table covered with an ancient, 
damaged piece of brocade in front. Half-way down on the right, with 
its face to the light, a large easel with a big new canvas set up on it, 
and a stand beside it with a colour-box and implements. Down on 
the left a smaller easel with a smaller canvas. Watercolour sketches 
and charcoal drawings are tacked on the walls ; several old and new 
canvases are stacked together on the floor. On stools, chairs and 
promiscuous pieces of furniture are scattered in confusion various 
articles of apparel and homely domestic utensils. The air of the 
whole place disgamished and makeshift. 

The stage is unoccupied till the bell from the street-door, suspended within 
sight, tinkles on its old relaxed spring. At the sound of the bell Tbddt 
AsHDOWN hurries out of the parlour, carrying the retarded breakfast-things 
on an extemporised tray. 

TEDDY, flurried, in extreme dishabille, only his shirt and trousers, without 
a necktie. 

A sitter ? Sir Ralph, by Jove ! (Scuttling down to the kitchen 



78 THE ALBUM 

with the tray.) And nothing washed up ! (Disappears moment- 
arily into the kitchen, where the crash of crockery hurriedly set down b heard 
while the hell again, in the stndio, more sharply tinkles. Tkddt emerging, 
more excited, looks about among the scattered garments for something more to 

put on.) I'm scarce ** washed-up " myself^ and (while he catches 

up a pair of bnu;es and iastens them behind) Certainly nOt dreSSed-Up ! 
(While the'.bell sounds a third time he reaches and opens the street-door. Then 
uirprised as Lady Basset is disclosed.) Lady BaSSet ! 

Enter Lady Basset. 
LADY BASSET. equaUy surprised. 

I find you in possession ? 

TEDDY, bis braces dangling behind. 

Sadly uncontested — unless youVe come for your por- 
trait ! 

LADY BASSET, while she looks anxiously round her. 

I've come for Sir Ralph Damant's — knowing his inten- 
tion to sit. 

TEDDY. 

He hasn't sat, worse luck ! We're waiting. 

LADY BASSET. 

You too ? What have you to do with it ? 

TEDDY. 

I'm employed by Mr. Bemal. 

LADY BASSET, looking at him up and down with extreme disapproval. 

Employed — as a model ? 



ACT SECOND 79 

TEDDY, vague ; then amusedly taking the hint. 

You mean for the — undraped? No, I don't pose — 
except to our creditors ! 

LADY BASSET, with visible rigour. 

Have they left you nothing to put on ? 

TEDDY, feverishly looking. 

Plenty if I can only find it ! (Then when, after buttoning his 

braces, he has laid his hands on a waistcoat, a jacket, and a necktie.) Re- 
duced by a parent's rigour to a mere miscellaneous 
wardrobe, IVe fallen back on my artistic nature. 

LADY BASSET, struck, emphatic 

Just what yve fallen back on I 

TEDDY. 

Mr. Bernal had been so kind to me in those agitated 
hours at Courtlands that I ventured to come to see him. 
I feel Fve a little gift that only requires direction. 

LAbY BASSET, encouraged. 

Exactly what / feel ! (Resolute.) He shall also direct 
mine ! — He's out ? 

TEDDY. 

He'll be back in a moment. He kindly puts me up. 

LADY BASSET, struck ; then eager. 

Does he board his pupils ? 

TEDDY. 

On the lowest terms ! 



8o THE ALBUM 

LADY BASSET. 

I shall discuss them with him. 

TEDDY, turpriaed. 

Do you wish him to put you up ? 

LADY BASSET. 

In order to be present at the sittings. 

TEDDY, vague. 

The sittings? 

LADY BASSET. 

That Sir Ralph has promised to give. To watch the 
painter's method. 

TEDDY, after an instant. 

Ain't you afraid he may watch yours ? 

LADY BASSET. 

I have none. I'm a creature of inspiration. 

TEDDY. 

But while you're abandoned to your inspiration what will 
become of dear Maud ? 

LADY BASSET. 

I've thrown her up. (After an instant.) Dear Maud's at 
large ! 

TEDDY, alert. 

Then I may enjoy her ? 



ACT SECOND 8i 

LADY BASSET. 

When did I ever prevent you ? 

TEDDY, recollecting, conceding. 

You did give a fellow a chance ! 

LADY BASSET, with abrupt and winning familiarity. 

Then let a fellow give me one ! (Appealing sociably.) Back 

me up ! (Then after an instant.) I Vc COme tO Stay ! (Eager, 
as the street-door opens.) Here he is ! (Then disconcerted, disap- 
pointed, as Mark Bernal appears : enter Mark Bernal from the street.) 

Oh! 

TEDDY, to Bernal. 

She's come to stay ! 

BERNAL, in informal but recognisable mourning ; coijimg down, gay, 
gallant, to Lady Basset. 

That's a note of defiance. We never release the fair ! 

TEDDY. 

She wants to study your method. 

BERNAL, to Lady Basset. 

Of dealing with the fair ? 

LADY BASSET, flattered, arch. 

That I know too well ! (After an instant) Of dealing with 
the timid ! 

BERNAL, sociable, encouraging, moving a chair. 

I begin with asking them to be seated. 

VOL. II G 



82 THE ALBUM 

LADY BASSET, taking the seat. 

Fm not speaking of myself — I'm speaking of Sir Ralph. 

BERNAL, eager. 

You've brought him with you ? 

LADY BASSET, alarmed. 

Brought him ? Won't he come of himself? 

BERNAL, unscrupulotisly amiable. 

He would if he knew you were here ! (Then, as with a happy 
thought, to Teddy.) I say — ^go and tell him ! 

TEDDY, vague. 

This moment ? 

BERNAL. 

At his noble mansion in Portland Place. 

LADY BASSET, staring. 

Has he moved to Portland Place ? . 

BERNAL. 

With his great new wealth ! 

LADY BASSET, rueful. 

While I've been writing to his chambers ! 

BERNAL, prompt, plausible. 

That's why you've had no answer ! He has now set up 
a palace. 

LADY BASSET, much impressed. 

A palace ? 



ACT SECOND 83 

BERNAL, laughing. 

Perhaps I should say a fortress ! 

LADY BASSET, conadering, politic, to Teddy. 

Don't go— I'll wait ! 

BERNAL. 
He must go for the beer. (Very friendly, to Lady Bassbt.) If 

you consent to share our fortunes, you'll perhaps share 
our refreshment ! 

LADY BASSET, looking at him ; tenderly significant. 

I'll pretend so — to be alone with you I 

BERNAL, responsive, smiling. 

I delight to be alone with you I (To Tbddy.) Have you 
any money? 

TEDDY. 

No ; have you ? 

BERNAL. 
Look in the teacup. (To Lady Basset, while Teddy goes up to the 

chimney-piece.) The teacup's our bank — a bank that's 
always breaking ! 

TEDDY, accidentally, as he reaches up for the cup, knocking it over and 
smashing it. 

It's broke now \ 

BERNAL, as he looks at the fragments ; good-humoured. 

Naturally — with nothing in it ! Won't they trust me ? 



84 THE ALBUM 

LADY BASSET, with renewed archness. 

They're wiser than I^ Mr. Bernal ! (Then to teddy, with her 
hand in her pocket.) But here's a shilling — to get rid of you ! 

(To Bernal, as Tbddy accepts the shilling and he protests with a gesture.) 

I'll take it out in lessons. 

TEDDY, who has picked up his hat ; at the street door, to Bernal. 

I told her your terms were low ! 

Exit Teddy to the street. 
BERNAL, struck, as if with a happy thought. 

Do you desire a course of instruction ? 

LADY BASSET, simpering. 

I feel I've a little gift that only requires direction. 

BERNAL, amused, encouraging. 
Your little gifts are profuse ! (Then as he picks up the morsels of 
the teacup.) If I form a school (cheerful, hopeful) I can gO in 
for a little jug with a slit ! (Having put away the pieces.) 

You're a messenger from heaven — we're living on hopes ! 

LADY BASSET, vague. 

Hopes of what ? 

BERNAL. 

Of bread and butter. Of my cousin's arrival, and his 

splendid pose. (With the vivid artistic ^dsion— a flourish of his hand 

before his eyes.) I sce his pose already ! 

LADY BASSET, with the same flourish. 

So do I ! 

BERNAL, with sudden ruefulness. 

But what I don't see yet is the " honorarium " 1 



ACT SECOND 85 

LADY BASSET. 
Is it to be so heavy ? 

BERNAL. 

A hundred pounds — the Millennium. (Sad.) The 
Millennium never comes ! 

LADY BASSET, reassuring. 

T^m not the Golden Age, no doubt ; but 1*11 pay every 
week. 

BERNAL, gallant. 

Dear lady, you pay every minute ! (Then jovial, making his 

preparations for her lesson, drawing out the smaller easel.) Oh, I shall 

get on — Teddy saves me a butler. 

LADY BASSET, as she draws oflf her gloves, smiling at him engagingly. 

What shall / save you ? 

BERNAL, after an instant ; rising to the occasion. 

The pursuit of lovely woman — if I may worship her at 
home ! 

LADY BASSET, wamingly, with arch-prudery. 

You must speak to me only of Art — for in Art there is 
no Impropriety ! 

BERNAL, gay. 

I quite understand that if there were, you'd never have 

entered (indicating with amused irony his shabby surroundings) this 

dedicated temple ! (Reassuring.) It's a ground on which 
we may meet with perfect delicacy ! (Then after pUdng a 

drawing-board on the smaller easel) What's the nature Of yOUr 

talent ? 



S6 THE ALBUM 

LADY BASSET, rising. 
The nature ? (Thinluiig, whlk he helps her off with her jacket ; then 

with effusion.) Sincere ! 

BERNAL, giving her a charcoal study of his own. 

Then copy that head — it's nice and fresh ! 

LADY BASSET, with the head, examining it. 

I must do it, you know, as \feel it ! 

BERNAL, anxious. 

Don't " feel " it too much — it may come off ! (Then, as 

she has put the sketch on a rest near the easel and seated herself) Do yOU 

mind if I change my coat ? 

LADY BASSET, seated at the easel, beginning her work from the sketch. 

Don't we agree that in Art there is no Impropriety ? 

BERNAL, amused, while he puts on an old black velveteen jacket taken 
down from a nail on which he has suspended his other coat. 

I don't change it for " Art " — I change it for economy. 
Do you mind if I smoke a pipe ? 

LADY BASSET, very vivacious, while she works. 

Do you mind if / do ? 

BERNAL. 

Alas, we've only two, and Teddy has the other ! (Then 

behind her, overlooking her start, while he stuffs and lights his pipe) 

Haven't you got the head awfully in the corner ? 

LADY BASSET, leaning back, with her own head very much on one side. 

That's how I feel it ! 



ACT SECOND 87 

BERNAL, amased, resigned, going over to his own easel. 

You feel it in a funny place ! 

LADY BASSET, working. 

My talent's intensely personal. 

BERNAL. 

Forgive me if my remarks are ! 

LADY BASSET. 

Absorbed in my inspiration, I become a monster of in- 
difference. (Then after a fit of rubbing her work and falling back, while 
Bernal lifts the big blank canvas off his easel, stands it against the wall and 
prepares something he can go on with.) What On earth dO€S keep 

him? 

BERNAL, preoccupied, standing at his easel 

Teddy, with that blessed beer ? 

LADY BASSET, in attitudes. 

Sir Ralph — the false, the faithless ! 

BERNAL, painting. 

He's paralysed by his prudence. 

LADY BASSET. 

He may indeed have been prudent with nie, but I can't 
pretend he has been paralysed. I've had startling 
glimpses of his passion ! 

BERNAL. 

Don't build on his passion — it's hollow. 



SS THE ALBUM 

LADY RASSET. aaoi 

Hollow? 



BERXAL. ! 

Inane — ^insane. Fate has marked him to stand alone! 

LADY BASSET, abnned, protestiiicr. 

Alone? 

BERNAL, with great sincerity, as he worics. 

He's SO rich, so brilliant, so gifted, that he's condemned 
to a splendid solitude. He sees all men as sordid — he 
sees all women as venaL A cruel doom has forbidden 
him to believe in human affection. 

LADY BASSET. 

And do you believe in it ? 

BERNAL, leaving his easel, smiling. 

I think it's my only faith ! And I've one thing that he 
hasn't — the freedom to cultivate it ! 

LADY BASSET. 

You've cultivated it in vain, since — like him ! — you stand 
alone. 

BERNAL. 

Alone ? Not a bit — ^with you here ! 

LADY BASSET. 

You're evidently afraid to marry. 

BERNAL. 

You're quite mistaken. Try me ! 



ACT SECOND 89 

LADY BASSET, startled, vague. 

"Try "you? 

BERNAL, cheerful, encouraging. 
Propose and you'll see ! (Then laughing, as she gives a shocked 

gesture) They do to Ralph ! 

LADY BASSET, struck, assenting. 

Dear Maud has done it, I know ! (Then after an insunt) And 
I strongly suspect Miss Jesmond. 

BERNAL, wondering. 

Miss Jesmond ? 

LADY BASSET. 

I know she has proposed to others ! 

BERNAL, after an instant. 

Well — she has been refused all round ! 

LADY BASSET, struck again, alarmed, seizing his arm. 

Do you suppose she has got him now ? 

BERNAL, vague, just wondering again. 

Now? 

LADY BASSET, with a sudden vision of the truth, while Teddy Ashdown 
reappears : re-enter Teddy Ashdown precipitately, with his tankard of 
beer, from the street, leaving the door open behind him. 

That creature keeps him away ! 

TEDDY, as he comes down with his beer and Lady Basset turns back to 
her work ; privately and excitedly to Bbrnal. 

He's come ! he's come : his footman's looking for the 
house ! 



90 THE ALBUM 

BERNAL, startled ; then, as if abruptly confessing, with great mgency and 
plausibility, to Lady Basset. 

Teddy announces a model ! 

LADY BASSET, agitated. 

A female ? 

TEDDY. 

The sort of thing you thought / was ! 

LADY BASSET, hesitating. 

For the figure ? 

BERNAL, assenting, smiling. 
But not a female. (Then, on a gesture of Lady Basset's ; as if out of 
consideration for her delicacy) Will yOU retire tO the parlour ? 

LADY BASSET, considering, as if to measure the full bearings of the situa- 
tion ; then majestically catching up her jacket ; to protect her purity. 

I'll retire ! (At the door of the parlour, which Teddy has opened for her ; 

resolute.) IVe come to Stay ! 

Exit Lady Basset. 

BERNAL, urgent, to Teddy. 

Stay with her ! (Exit Thddy Ashdown to the parlour, while Bernal 
eagerly meets Sir Ralph, who appears in the open doorway. Enter Sir Ralph 
Damant from the street.) YouVe COme tO sit ? 

SIR RALPH, in deep, distinguished mourning ; visibly and unfavoumbly 
impressed by his cousin's Bohemian accessories. 

Do you consider there's anything to sit on ? 

BERNAL, laughing. 

Some of the chairs have legs, and some have backs — 



ACT SECOND 91 

SIR RALPH, as he looks criticaUy round. 
But none have both ! (Then checking Bbrnal gravely in the move- 
ment to provide him with a seat) There are preliminaries— con- 
ditions. 

BERNAL, arrested but amused. 

Why, I thought we had settled them at Courtlands ! 

SIR RALPH, after an instant. 

Do you mean the sum to be paid ? 

BERNAL. 

Paid, my dear Ralph (hesitating, smiling) as soon as you're 
so very good as to pay it ! 

SIR RALPH, surprised and as if resenting his avidity. 

How can I pay it before I judge of the likeness ? 

BERNAL. 

How can you judge of the likeness before I've a chance 
to catch it ? (Laughmg.) " First catch your hare ! " 

SIR RALPH. 

Your images make me shudder ! — all the more that 
(thanks to the rigour of my mourning!) I've enjoyed 
for a while a period of exemption from the chase. Now 
that IVe quitted my retreat — 

BERNAL. 

It's only to remind me of that charming feature of our 
contract — 



93 THE ALBUM 

SIR RALPH. 

Your guarantee of safety — ! 

BERNAL, interrupting again in turn ; good-humoured. 

And resemblance! So that it's not till I hand you 
these commodities — 

SIR RALPH. 

Over the counter, as it were, that I hand you a hundred 
pounds ! 

[BERNAL, disappointed, but trying to be cheerful ; about to lay his hands 
gaily oii Sir Ralph, as if to put him in position. 

The attitude's found — I'll do you in the act ! 

SIR RALPH, struck, approving. 

And call the picture "The Patron of Art," or "The 
Friend in Need '' ? Before I can throw myself into that 
character with the requisite calm, iVe a deep anxiety to 
allay. 

BERNAL, impatient. 

Another ? 

SIR RALPH. 

There's always another! How have you disposed of 
Miss Jesmond ? 

BERNAL, blank. 

Disposed of her ? Not at all ! 

SIR RALPH, displeased. 

Then you don^t carry out our bargain ? 



ACT SECOND 93 

BERNAL. 
Such a bargain as that ? It takes three to make it ! I 
haven't seen the tip of her nose. 

SIR RALPH, wondering, grave. 

She's lying low ? 

BERNAL, ndsmg and dropping his arms ; irresponsible. 

She has vanished from my ken ! 

SIR RALPH, reflecting. 

She's laying a train. 

BERNAL. 

Then it's a very long one ! You remember when she 
quitted Courtlands ? 

SIR RALPH, assenting. 

The day of her patron's death. 

BERNAL, with a certain veiled, sarcastic bitterness. 

His patrdnage had limits — as appeared by his will ! 

SIR RALPH, after an instant 

Do you allude to his overlooking you ? 

BERNAL. 

To his overlooking her. 

SIR RALPH. 

She had five years of pickings. 



94 THE ALBUM 

BERNAL. 
Do you mean that she still has resources ? 

SIR RALPH, with the same serenity. 

Her character — which is unmistakable — supplies them 
in abundance. 

BERNAL, after an instant ; as if thinking this over. 

If you haven't seen her, how should I ? 

SIR RALPH. 

You were so grossly indiscreet as to boast to her of my 
order. 

BERNAL, smiling. 

Forgive my natural pride ! But if she has found no 
pretext for approaching you — 

SIR RALPH, interrupting. 
I tremble at every ring ! (Then with a violent sUrt, as the bell of the 
street-door sounds out) There • she JS ! (To himself, seeing Tbddv 
burst out of the parlour to answer the bell : re-enter Teddy Ashdown from 
the parlour) And there he is ! (Then to Bernal, while Teddy 
passes to the street-door ; quickly moving to the parlour) Let me eSCapC ! 

BERNAL, alarmed, catching, intercepting him, while Teddy opens the street- 
door and Maud Vanneck appears. 

Not there ! 

Enter Maud Vanneck from the street 
TEDDY, welcoming Maud ; delighted. 

So jolly of you to look a fellow up 1 



ACT SECOND 95 

SIR RALPH, relieved, but still highly disgusted. 

Permit me to dissent from that ! 

TEDDY, explaining her to the others. 

Lady Basset chucks her. 

MAUD, cheerful 

But I can face the usual dangers ! 

SIR RALPH. 

That's more, madam, than / can do ! (Then aside to Bernal, 

while Maud allows Teddy joyfully to divest her of her jacket and feather boa) 

I leave the housie ! 

BERNAL, genuinely distressed. 

Where'U you go ? 

SIR RALPH, thinking; with dignity. 

ril drive on the Embankment. 

BERNAL, urgent. 

And you'll come back — ? 

SIR RALPH, at the street-door. 

When you've worked her off! 

Exit Sir Ralph. 
MAUD, disconcerted ; with compunction. 

I've driven Sir Ralph away ! 

TEDDY. 

What do you want of Sir Ralph when you've got a fellow 
like me ? 



96 THE ALBUM 

BERNAL, impatient 

She has got nothing of the sort, Teddy. You'll please 
to return to your studies. 

TEDDY, resenting this decree, with injured dignity. 

If you didn't take me, Mr. Bernal, for nothing — 

BERNAL, good-humoured, gay. 

I should take you for a dangerous rival ! And on the 
mere chance I banish you ! 

TEDDY, at the door to the parlour. 

When I can I'll pay you ! 

Exit Teddy Ashdown. 
BERNAL, to Maud. 

To what do I owe the honour of your visit ? 

MAUD. 

Abandoned by my natural protectors, Fve fallen back 
on my artistic nature. I feel Fve a little gift that only 
requires direction. 

BERNAL, eager. 

You enter my school ? 

MAUD, reluctant, indicating the parlour. 

Do you mean that place ? 

BERNAU 

It's there that I hold my class ! 



ACT SECOND 97 

MAUD. 
But where do you paint Sir Ralph ? 

BERNAL, disconcerted. 

Did I tell you too I was to paint him ? 

MAUD. 

Miss Jesmond told me — at Courtlands. You know we 
came away together. 

BERNAL, alert. 

Where did Miss Jesmond go ? 

MAUD. 

She came to London. 

BERNAL. 

And where is she now ? 

MAUD, with asperity. 

I haven't the least idea ! (Then more persuasive.) You must 
let me see you at work. 

BERNAL. 

At work on Sir Ralph ? You mustn't let me see you I 

MAUD, after an instant ; arch. 

Do you fear him too as a rival ? 

BERNAL, blank. 

A rival ? 

VOL. II H 



98 THE ALBUM 

MAUD. 
Isn't that what you call Mr. Ashdown ? 

BERNAL. 

As a manner of speaking ! If I fear my cousin as a 

rival, it's as a -rival to Teddy. (After an instant, coaxing.) I 

should like much better to see you at work on him ! 
He's a fine little chap, is Teddy. 

MAUD, impatient. 

Dear Mr. Bernal, I don't want a fine little chap. I 
want a man of the world — and a man of means. I want 

social distinction. I want (thinking; then with vain emphasis) 

oh, I want a lot of things ! 

BERNAL. 

Yes ; you all want a lot of things. I should think it 
would be enough to want a little thing called happiness ! 

MAUD. 

But happiness depends on such a lot ! 

BERNAL. 

Does yours depend on your bringing down Sir Ralph ? 

MAUD, after an instant. 
You're awfully vulgar, you know ! (Then after another instant. 

Do you beheve I can ? 

BERNAL. 

I believe almost any woman can experiment successfully 
on almost any man. 



ACT SECOND 99 

MAUD» eager. 

Make him love her? 

BERNAL. 

Yes — and make him hate her for doing it ! You're 
young, you're pretty, you're clever — 

MAUD, interrupting, complacent. 

And I've had the Higher Education ! 

BERNAL, smiling. 
The Higher, but not the Highest ! (Then more gravely, but 
very kindly.) The cducation of UnSClfish affection ! (Pleading, 

sociably, tenderly.) Think a little more of that, and a little 
less of baubles and baronets ! Don't misapply your 
gifts; don't pervert your youth; don't harden your 
heart. (After an instant.) Don't try to get on without love ! 

MAUD, as if struck, incipiently charmed, by his appeal. 

Have you tried ? 

BERNAL. 

Not for a single hour ! I've loved, though I've lost ! 
So, bare as you see me here, I dispense with a lot of 
things. I'm rich in faith. 

MAUD. 

Faith in what ? 

BERNAL. 

In the present woman — whoever she is ! 

MAUD. 

And what do you do about the absent ? 



loo THE ALBUM 

BERNAL, laughing. 

I don't recognise the absent. She's always the loser ! 

MAUD, after an instant. 

If I were to marry you I think I'd look after you ! 

BERNAL. 

I want some one awfully to look after me. 

MAUD. 
With such a person, and (lool^mg rather compassionately round her) 

such a home, you'd enter upon a union — ? 

BERNAL, prompt. 

In a moment — in Teddy's place ! 

MAUD, disconcerted, called back to reality while the bell of the street-door 
rings. 

Oh, Teddy's— ! 

Re-enter Teddy Ashdown precipitately from the parlour. 
BERNAL. 

Teddy's place is to answer the bell. 

MAUD, eager, while Teddy goes to the door. 

Sir Ralph back ? 

TEDDY, opening the street-door, announcing, exclaiming. 

Dear old Miss Jesmond ! 

Enter Grace Jesmond. ' 



ACT SECOND loi 

BERNAL, with astonishment and alacrity, meeting her. 

Miss Jesmond ! 

GRACE, who has paused an instant, as if, at the sight of Maud, with a last 
irrepressible hesitation. 

I had your address. 

BERNAL, rejoicing. 

How jolly — it was in that book ! 

TEDDY, sociable, ingenuous. 

Oh yes, in that book ! 

GRACE, pale, tired, appreciably altered ; in simple, economical mourning ; 
addressing Teddy very kindly, but markedly as if to check him. 

I'm glad to find you, Mr. Ashdown. 

MAUD, who on Grace's entrance has passed in visible displeasure to the sofa 
under the window, where she has seated herself ; hearing this. 

Mr. Ashdown ! (Teddy hurries over to her and talks with her.) 
BERNAL, to Grace, in frank wonderment and appreciation. 

You've put on mourning — when he left you nothing ? 

GRACE, at the left, gcavely indicating his own garb while she sinks upon the 
other sofa. 

What did he leave you ? (Then as Bernal, with a motion as of 

cheerful, resigned dismissal of the subject, places himself beside her.) I've 

come to see you (after an instant) on account of your pro- 
fession. 

BERNAL, struck, amused. 

You too have a little gift — ? 



I02 THE ALBUM 

GRACE, vague. 

A little gift ? 

BERNAL, laughing. 

That only requires direction ! 

GRACE, smiling sadly. . 

rm afraid I've no gift at all — that's exactly why I've 
come. (After an insunt) I must find employment. 

BERNAL, vague. 

As an amanuensis ? 

GRACE. ' 

I've tried for that — in vain. 

BERNAL, sympathetic. 

Nobody wants one ? 

GRACE, with the same sad smile ; discouraged, resigned. 

Everybody has one ! 

BERNAL, smiling. 

/ haven't, Miss Jesmond ; but on the other hand — 

GRACE, as he pauses. 

You've SO little correspondence ? 

BERNAL. 

I fear it's of a sort (after an instant, laughing) not to be deputed 
to another. 

GRACK 
It's not with that idea that I've ventured to approach 



ACT SECOND 103 

you. (Then after a supreme hesitation.) YouVc the Only artist 

I happen to know — and I've come to suggest myself as 
a model. 

BERNAL, wonderstruck. 

A model ? 

MAUD, overhearing, rising ; to Teddy. 
A model ? (Then as she seizes the idea ; with emphatic compunction.) 

That's what / ought to have done ! 

TEDDY, on his feet, equally struck, delighted. 

It's not too late will you sit to me ? (Then eager, to Bbrnal, 

indicating Maud.) May she sit tO me ? 

BERNAL, rising, struck, thinking an instant ; then happy to adopt the 
suggestion. 

Certainly — in the parlour ! 

TEDDY, disconcerted, objecting. 

With Lady Basset ? 

MAUD, astonished. 

Lady Basset? 

TEDDY, explaining. 

She's the Second Pupil. 

BERNAL, insistent. 

The Second Pupil must have the same advantages as 
the First ! Therefore (settling the matter, to Maud) you must 
sit to both of them ! 

MAUD, majestic and sarcastic, looking at Grace. 

While Miss Jesmond sits to you ? 



I04 THE ALBUM 

BERNAL, after an instant, gay. 

Miss Jesmond's professional ! 

Maud, at this, gives a shocked gesture and, as if retiring to avoid some inde- 
corous exhibition, goes up with Teddy, who ushers and follows her into the 
parlour while Bernal returns to Grace. 

GRACE, who during this discussion has sat motionless, only with her eyes 
attentively wandering over the tell-tale indications of the place. 

Not yet — but I really want to be ! 

BERNAL, on the sofa again. 

YouVe quite without resources ? 

GRACE, very simple. 

Quite without resources. 

BERNAL. 

You've never been able to save ? 

GRACE. 

IVe a sister (after an instant) whoiu I help. Her husband's 
dying — she has children — she has troubles. So you see 
I must do something — and do it soon. There are 
people I've seen, in past years, at Courtlands — it's to 
those people I've been. It was at Courtlands I sslw you 
— and it's to you I come last. (After a moment.) IVe been 
to shops, first. I've been told to come again — ^and I've 
gone again. But it's the same everywhere — there's 
nothing to be had. It occurred to me at last that I had 
heard of girls who earn money — however little ! — by 



ACT SECOND 105 

sitting to painters; sitting for the head, the hair, the 
hands, for — ^what do you call it ? — the " type" ; in story- 
book attitudes, in short- waisted frocks, in old faded 
Kate Greenaway dresses. So I thought there might be 
a demand (smiUng again) and that I might — with a little 
patience ! — do something to meet it. I'm perhaps not 
clumsier — nor uglier ! — than some. Pm willing to try 
hard, to do my best ; and if it's only a question of keep- 
ing still oh, I can do that : so still so still ! (Then after 

an instant, brave, simple.) Anything tO boil the pOt ! 

BERNAL, who has listened intently. 

Your idea's ingenious — but is there nothing else you 
can do? 

GRACE. 

I've hunted up and down for a month. And the only 
definite thing I've found is how many others are hunting 
— a thousand partners in the chase ! 

BERNAL, laughing. 

Diana and all her nymphs ! So you've kindly come to 
me—? 

GRACE. 

In my ignorance of the next best step. 

BERNAL, very kind. 

It's a cruel change — from your life at Courtlands. 

GRACK 

Do you remember you told me at Courtlands that free- 
dom is sweet ? (After an instant.) I'm tasting its sweetness ! 



io6 THE ALBUM 

BERNAL, after a moment. 

I wish I could assist you ! 

GRACE, with extreme but suppressed apprehension. 

Vm not the " type " ? IVe not the appearance — ? 

BERNAL, abrupt. 

YouVe the appearance, Miss Jesmond, of an angel ! 

GRACE, rising quickly ; concluding. 

But you've simply no present use for me ! 

BERNAL, rising ; then with the artist's gesture of evocation. 

I see you perfectly — I place you — I catch you. But 

(with a sad smile and a slow head-shake) I lose yOU again ! 

GRACE, looking vaguely about. 
Of course you Ve plenty of people. (Then after an instant.) Do 

you happen to know some painter — ? 

BERNAL, falling in, thinking. 

Who would be ready for such a sitter ? There isn't a 
fellow in London who wouldn't rejoice in the chance ! 

(Then feeling his pockets for a notebook ; looking round for something to write 

on.) I'll give you the best addresses. 

GRACE, as he comes down again, finding nothing. 

You're looking for notepaper ? 

BERNAL, embarrassed, ashamed ; still looking. 
We had a sheet last week ! (Then blushing, conscious, smlUng, 

while he confesses his destitution.) You'rc not in a land of plenty ! 



ACT SECOND 107 

GRACE, looking at bim an instant, then abruptly drawing the sketchbook of 
Act First from under her mantle. 

Write in that. 

BERNAL, recognising gaily his book. 

My album — you've brought it back ? 

GRACE. 
IVe brought it back. (After an instant.) I thought you 
might need it. 

BERNAL, laughing, scribbling addresses on a leaf of the album. 

You see I do ! 

GRACE, looking about the place again while he writes. 

It's your only one ? 

BERNAL, writing, preoccupied, smiling. 

My one ewe-lamb ! 

GRACE. 

It was good of you to give it to me 

BERNAL, still writing. 

Don't praise me — ^when I take it back ! 

GRACE, smiling. 

I put you to special expenses ! 

BERNAL, tearing out of the album the leaf on which he has written ; folding 
and giving it to her. 

You see I stagger beneath them ! 



io8 THE ALBUM 

GRACE, with the paper, which she slowly puts into her portemoonaie. 

But I also see you have pupils. 

BERNAL, smUing. 

I take them for nothing. 

GRACE. 

You're too generous. (Then after a moment.) But youVc 
had orders. 

BERNAL. 

For portraits ? I've had one, thank heaven ! 

GRACE, after another moment. 

From Sir Ralph Damant ? 

BERNAL, struck. 

You knew it ? 

GRACE 
You told me at Courtlands. (Then as he gives a lively gesture of 

rccoUection.) YouVc had no Other ? 

BERNAL, philosophic. 

No other. 

GRACE. 

Is Sir Ralph finished ? 

BERNAL. 

He's not begun. He begins to-day. 

GRACE, as if definitely influenced by this ; thinking. 

To-day? 



ACT SECOND 109 

BERNAL, noticing her interest in the question ; attentive. 

He comes to sit — ^you may meet him. 

GRACE, considering, assenting. 

I see — 1 may meet him. 

BERNAL, laughing. 

He may meet you ! 

GRACE, who has moved away an instant, and once more has turned her eyes 
over the room ; speaking at last, as she faces him again, abruptly. 

Mr. Bernal — are you very poor ? 

BERNAL. 

Do you suppose. if I were not I would decline your 
splendid offer ? The stupid, sordid truth, Miss Jesmond, 
is that I can't afford a model ! 

GRACE, grave. 
I see. (Then with mfinite gentleness.) I'm very SOrry. 

BERNAL. 

You can't be sorrier than I ! It was awfully nice of you 
to come ; but youVe brought your etapty pitcher to a 
thirsty land ! 

GRACE, after an instant. 

You're as poor as I am ? 

BERNAL. 

You make me feel much poorer ! And it's^ the first 
time my condition has seemed to me (bringing out the word 

with expression, resentment) Ugly ! 



no THE ALBUM 

GRACE. 
It's the first time mine has seemed to me endurable ! 

CThta as she visibly lingers, delays to go» takes another survey of the studio.) 

Do you live without— comfort ? 

BERNAL, laughing. 

With such comfort as you behold ! 

GRACE, taking out again the paper he has given her. 

And these artists are rich ? 

BERNAL. 

They're richer. Do try them ! 

GRACE, looking at the list. 
I'll try them. (Then stiU stationary, with the list in her hand.) It's 

your cousin's hour ? 

BERNAL. 

It's my cousin's hour. 

GRACE. 

Then I suppose I ought to go. 

BERNAL, after a moment 

Your time of course is limited. 

GRACE, continuing to twist her paper nervously, without any movement of 
departure. 

My necessity indeed presses. (Then after an instant.) From 
the moment my business is over — 



ACT SECOND in 

BERNAL, smiling, as she vaguely pauses. 

YouVe no reason to stay ? 

GRACE. 

None I can conveniently express. (Smiling.) I'm not, 
like Miss Vanneck, a pupil. 

BERNAL, laughing. 

Nor like my Lady Basset ! (After an instant.) They can 
express their reason ! 

GRACE, as if thinking what this can be ; then bringing it out 

Sir Ralph Damant ? 

BERNAL. 

They want to corner him ! 

GRACE, looking down while she speaks. 

To "corner" him? 

BERNAL. 
To marry him ! 

GRACE, after an instant. 

Both? 

BERNAL, laughing. 

Both ! 

GRACE. 

And they're waiting for him ? 

BERNAL. 

They're waiting for him !

GRACE, after an instant, smiling, but as if thinking. 

/won't, then. 

BERNAL, pretendingly jocular. 

You'll call on him at home ? 

GRACE, with her eyes on him a moment in silence. 

Where does he live ? 

BERNAL. 

Portland Place, 130. 

GRACE. 

Thank you. (Then looking again at her list.) If thcse gentle- 
men employ me — 

BERNAL, emphatical but sad, as she pauses. 

You'll be SO taken up that I shall never see you again ! 

GRACE, who has finally, wearily put away her paper and gathered her mantle 
round her. 

Good-bye, Mr. Bernal. 

BERNAL, after an instant 

Good-bye, Miss Jesmond. 

GRACE, turns away from him as if to move to the door, taking as she does so 
a supreme look round. Then suddenly, in this act, she falters, totters 
slightly, raises her hand to her head, as if faint or giddy, with an ejaculation 
of distress. 

Ah! 

BERNAL, moving, anxious, quick, to her assistance. 

YouVe ill ? 



ACT SECOND 113 

GRACE, reaching out to support herself. 

I'm faint ! 

BERNAL, catching, sustaining her 

You're exhausted — you're quite done ! 

GRACE, panting, trymg to recover herself, while Lady Basset reappears. 

Walking over London — since breakfast ! 

Re-enter Lady Basset from the parlour. 

LADY BASSET, stopping short, arrested, scandalised by the sight of Bernal 
closely holding, apparently embracing, Grace. 

Mr. Bernal, what on earth are you doing ? 

BKRNAL, startled, while he quickly separates from Grace ; embarrassed, but 
smiling and plausibly explaining. 

Setting up my model ! 

LADY BASSET. 
Your model ? (Then struck, inspired, looking from one of them to the 

other.) I've come in to tell you that my little gift requires 
more direction than you seem to have time for. So, 
with leisure on my hands, why shouldn't / perform that 
function ? 

BERNAL. 

Sit for me — in character? (Gay.) You'd come ex- 
pensive

to "stay" ; prompt. 

Let it not be a question of money. I'll do it for love !

114 THE ALBUM 

GRACE, gathering herself together again with a wan smile for Bernal. 

Profit by such a chance. Good-bye ! 

BERNAL, doubly reluctant now to let her go ; seizing a pretext for detaining 
and refreshing her. 

YouVe had nothing since breakfast? Models have 
appetites ! (Bethinking himself, casting about.) They particu- 
larly depend on their tea. 

LADY BASSET. 

I particularly depend on mine ! 

BERNAL. 

I think there is some — somewhere or other. 

GRACE, pulling herself together. 

Then I won't refuse it. 

BERNAL, to Lady Basset, invitingly, after he has quickly opened the door 
of the kitchen. 

I daresay it's in there. There's something in the nature 
of a kettle — ! 

LADY BASSET, aloof, mindful only of her dignity and her clothes. 

Shall I call Mr. Ashdown to make it boil ? 

GRACE, suddenly reviving, interposing, catching at the occasion to remain. 

Let me make it boil ! (With a brightened smile.) Fm all right 
as soon as I work ! 

BERNAL, unwilling, protesting, while she eagerly unfastens her mantle. 

Work ? Not in your condition ! 



ACT SECOND 115 

GRACE, quite gay. 

Isn't it exactly what my condition wants ? (Then while he 

has helped her off with her cloak and taken it from her.) I'll take off my 
hat ! (Removing and giving it to him to put with the cloak.) And pin 
up the skirt of my only frock ! (Turning up her dress till it shows 
half her petticoat, and passing Bernal a pin.) Will yOU do it ? 

LADY BASSET, watching her with discomfiture as Bbrnal fastens the skirt 
behind ; to herself. 

Why didn't I think of thatl 

BERNAL, vague, hopeful, to Grace, who has reached the door of the kitchen. 

There are things — if you can make them out. 

GRACE, who has taken her hat and jacket back from him ; at the door. 

I'll make them out ! 

Exit Grace Jbsmond. 
LADY BASSET. 

Is there bread and butter ? 

BERNAL. 

I've an earnest trust ! 

LADY BASSET, while Grace reopens the door of the kitchen. 

And any little extra ? 

GRACE. 
Mr. Bernal ! 

BERNAL, while he hurries to Grace and Teddy Ashdown reappears ; 
addressing Lady Basset from the door of the kitchen. 

I'll ascertain ! 

Exit Mark Bernal. Re*enter Teddy Ashdown from the parlour. 



ii6 THE ALBUM 

TEDDY, disconcerted, coouDg down. 

Dear Maud won't sit ! 

LADY BASSET, ptcoccupied with her tea. 

Is there any little extra ? 

TEDDY, vague. 

In the course of instruction ? 

LADY BASSET. 

In the course of recreation, (indicating the kitchen.) They're 
making tea. 

TEDDY. 

Oh, we don't have little extras ! 

LADY BASSET. 

I introduce a new system. 

TEDDY, blank. 

How in the world ? 

LADY B.\SSET. 

What have you done with my change ? 

TEDDY. 
From the beer ? (PullIng out a few coppers and looking at them in de- 
precation.) It ain't enough ! 

Re-enter Maud Vanneck from the parlour. 

LADY BASSET. 

Miss Vanneck — contribute ! 



ACT SECOND 117 

TEDDY, explaining, coaxing. 

To the purchase of some little extra. (Then as Maud, staring, 

gives a gesture of depressed destitution and the bell of the street-door sounds.) 

It's Sir Ralph ! 

MAUD, while Teddy hurries to the door. 

Get the money from him / 

Re-enter Sir Ralph by the door that Tbddy opens ; then stops in dismay at 
the sight of the two women. 

LADY BASSET, instantly advancing upon him. 

Will you give us half-a-crown ? 

MAUD, engaging. 

To buy some innocent relish. 

SIR RALPH, bewildered, shocked. 

Half-a-crown — for an innocent relish ? (Then as if considering. 
It's a monstrous price ! 

LADY BASSET, persuasive. 

For a treat to Mr. Bernal ? 

TEDDY. 

He has nothing for tea ! 

SIR RALPH. 
Nothing ? (As if reflecting, calculating, while he takes out his purse. 

Then I'll advance — two shillings. 

Re-enter Mark Bernal from the kitchen. 



ii8 THE ALBUM 

TEDDY, to Maud, uking the money. 

I'll be back in a moment ! 

Exit Teddy Ashdown to the street. 
SIR RALPH, to Bbrnal. 

There are two shillings to deduct. 

BERN A L, amused. 

ril deduct them ! Shall I also deduct the ladies ? 

LADY BASSET. 

Never — till we've had our tea ! 

MAUD, seeing Grace reappear. 

Here it comes now ! 

Re-enter Grace Jesmond with a tea*tray, teapot, cups and saucers. 

SIR RALPH, to himself; still more discomfited and more aghast. 
Miss Jesmond ! (Then, down on the right, resentful, to Bernal, while 
Grace sets the tray on the table before the chimney and the other ladies clear 

a place for it.) Whcre's your honour ? 

BERNAL, vague. 

My honour ? 

SIR RALPH, indicating the women. 

Your engagement. 

BERNAL. 

To absorb them ? 

SIR RALPH. 

To prevent their absorbing me I 



ACT SECOND 119 

BERNAL. 
I have prevented it. They're making love to me ! 

SIR RALPH, dubious. 

Miss Jesmond ? 

BERNAL, after an instant, thinking. 

I'm not so sure of Miss Jesmond. 

SIR RALPH, peremptory. 

Then what's she here for ? (As Bern a l hesitates.) She's 
here to make love to me I 

BERNAL, after another instant. 

I think you're hard on her. 

SIR RALPH. 

Didn't she know I was coming ? 

BERNAL. 

I admit she did. 

SIR RALPH, triumphant. 

Then it's proved ! 

BERNAL, affected by what Sir Ralph has said, worried and discomposed ; 
watching Grace an instant at the table with the other ladies ; then with a 
nervous laugh. 

Yes it's "proved " ! (He goes uneasily up while Lady Basset, 

carrying a cup of tea, comes down to Sir Ralph.) 

LADY BASSET. 

A cup of tea, dear friend ? 

SIR RALPH, taking the cup from her as if under uncanny coercion ; 
looking at her in deep mistrust. 

What have you put in it ? 



I20 THE ALBUM 

LADY BASSET, beaming. 

My gratitude, Sir Ralph ! 

SIR RALPH, guarded, blank. 

Gratitude for what ? 

LADY BASSET, secure. 

The devotion you promised. 

SIR RALPH, impatient. 

Oh, damn the devotion ! 

LADY BASSET, resentful. 

You withhold it ? 

SIR RALPH, looking at her hard a moment ; then politic, accommodatbg. 

To your very good health ! (He drains down the cup, under her 
eye, with submission, then hands it summarily back to her ; after which she 
goes up to put it down and Maud descends on the other side with a plate of 
bread and butter.) She haS drugged it ! (Then very sarcastic, as 
Maud offers him her bread and butter.) What have I promised 

youl 

MAUD, sad, sentimental. 

Nothing, alas ! 

SIR RALPH, turning unceremoniously away from her. 

Then I decline your poison ! 

He crosses to the other side of the stage, as if to break with her for ever, and she, 
checked in her overture, discouraged, goes up again with her plate. Teddy 
AsHDOWN meanwhile has re-entered from the street with his purchase, which 
he lays down on table before the others ; coming down immediately after to 
Sir Ralph. 



AGT SECOND 121 

TEDDY, giving Sir Ralph a sixpence and coppers. 

The change. 

SIR RALPH, looking at the money. 

Elevenpence ? 

TEDDY. 

Tenpence ! 

He goes up while Sir Ralph pockets the money, and as he rejoins the others 
Grace Jbsmond, who has drunk her tea and turned away from the table, 
stands looking an instant at Sir Ralph. Then she comes down to him while 
Bernal, who has noticed her movement, continues to observe her 

GRACE, with veiled irony, to Sir Ralph. 

Immensely graceful of you to sit ! 

SIR RALPH, with decision. 

I shall not sit ! — I object to the conditions ! 

GRACE, with repressed emotion. 

Youll not keep faith ? 

SIR RALPH. 

It's he who has broken it ! 

GRACE. 

I beg you to accept the conditions. 

SIR RALPH. 

Accept you as one of them ? 

GRACE, feeling the impertinence, the insult of this ; then quickly controlling 
herself ; with a smile. 

Am I one of the worst, Sir Ralph ? 



122 THE ALBUM 

SIR RALPH. 
The worst for his job ! 

GRACE, considering. 

I should be very sorry to injure Mr. Bernal. 

SIR RALPH. 

You do awfully, you know, by your conduct. 

GRACE, still wondering. 

In what manner can I modify it ? 

SIR RALPH. 
By ceasing to spring up in my path ! 

GRACE, smiling. 

I only spring up to check your retreat ! 

SIR RALPH, demurring to the term. 

My "retreat"? 

GRACE. 

From your agreement to assist Mr. Bernal. (After an 
instant.) Mr. Bcmal needs assistance. 

SIR RALPH, curt, impatient. 

Why on earth should he ? 

GRACE, indicating the whole place. 

Look about you and see ! 



ACT SECOND 123 

SIR RALPH, after a glance. 

I see a lot of women! — Mark likes 'em! (Then after an 
instant.) I'll sit if he*ll clear the place. 

GRACE. 

He will — of those ladies. 

SIR RALPH, sharp. 

But not of you ? 

GRACE. 

If he turns me out he'll separate me — (Pausing, significantly 

hesitating.) 

SIR RALPH. 

Separate you — ? 

GRACE, smiling. 

From you, Sir Ralph ! 

SIR RALPH. 
That's exactly what I demand ! (Turning away from her, he 
crosses to the other side of the stage.) I say, Mark I (Then on Bernal's 

coming down as Gracb goes up.) You'll have to take that girl 
by the shoulders ! (On Bernal's biankness.) To put her out. 

BERNAL, thinking, demurring, while he looks at Sir Ralph. 

I'm more and more struck with her charm ! 

SIR RALPH, as if scandalised. 

Her charm ? 

BERNAL. 

Her spirit, her cleverness, her character ! The more 
you've reason to dread her the more she needs my eye ! 



124 THE ALBUM 

SIR RALPH. 

Your eye can rest a bit I let you off. 

BERNAL. 

It's a joy as well as a duty ! 

SIR RALPH. 

Your joy should be to paint my portrait, and to clear 
the place for the purpose. 

BERNAL, prompt. 

I'll clear it ! (Then to the others.) As I must get to work 
with Sir Ralph I beg my pupils to retire ! 

LADY BASSET, resentful. 

Without seeing your method ? 

BERNAL, bending over her hand, kissing it in farewell. 

This, dear lady, is my method ! (Then urging her up to the 

parlour with Maud.) Put On yOUr loVCly things ! (Indicating all 

the tea-things.) Teddy, rcmovc ! 

LADY BASSET, at door of the parlour ; to Bbrnal. 

Begin — while I dress ! 

Exit Lady Basset. 
MAUD, to Sir Ralph, at the door of parlour. 

That takes her an hour ! 

Exit Maud Vannbck, while Teddy Ashdown, gathering up the tea-things, 
goes out with them to the kitchen and Sir Ralph, with bare patience, sits 
rigidly detached on the sofa under the window. 



ACT SECOND 125 

GRACE, to Bernal. 

Do you begin immediately ? 

SIR RALPH, resolute. 

We don't begin till youVe gone. 

GRACE, to Bernal. 

Before I go I should like to speak to Sir Ralph. 

SIR RALPH, rising in dismay. 

Again, Madam ? 

GRACE, to Bernal. . 

If you'll give me the fortunate chance. 

BERNAL. 

Do you mean alone ? 

GRACE, smiling. 

I mean alone ! 

BERNAL, who has looked at her hard an instant ; mj'stified, perplexed, tor- 
mented by everything that appears to give colour to Sir Ralph's account 
of her. 

Shall I leave you, Ralph ? 

SIR RALPH, falling back helpless and hopeless on the sofa. 

I meet my doom 1 

BERNAL, at the street-door, having taken up his hat and holding up an 
empty tube of oilcolour. 

There's a chap next door — I'll borrow some blue ! 

Exit Mark Bernal. 



126 THE ALBUM 

GRACE, who has taken up from the table where Bbrnal has placed it after 
tearing out the leaf the album of Act First. 

Allow me to ask (after an instant, while she looks at the book) if yOuVe 

ever seen this. 

SIR RALPH, from the sofa, with his glass. 

That ? 

GRACE, holding out the album. 

This sketchbook. 

SIR RALPH, struck, then slowly rising. 

Seen it? — Where? 

GRACE. 

At Courtlands — the hour you arrived. 

SIR RALPH. 

How can I remember what I saw the hour I arrived ? 

GRACE. 

Mr. Ashdown can remember. He told me. 

SIR RALPH, startled, staring. 

Told you ? 

GRACE. 

Half an hour later. That you had seen Mr. Bernal's 
name. 

SIR RALPH. 

His name — where ? 

GRACE, handing him the album. 

On that page — with that date. 



ACT SECOND 127 

SIR RALPH, with the album ; looking hard an instant at the page ; then 
hard an instant at Grace. 

I believe 1 have. What then ? 

GRACE. 

You denied it — in my own presence. (Then after an insunt.) 
You denied it to the Vicar. 

SIR RALPH, after looking at the book again, chucking it away as if with 
indignant impatience. 

What the devil are you talking about ? 

GRACE. 

About the great wrong you were guilty of. You deceived 
a dying man — you robbed a living. 

SIR RALPH. 
Living ? I didn't dream he was living ! 

GRACE. 
It seems to me that book might have made you dream ! 

SIR RALPH. 

It would if I had seen it in time. 

GRACE. 

You did see it in time — in time to show it to Mr. 
Ashdown. 

SIR RALPH, staring, as if recalling. 

That was after the Vicar — 



128 THE ALBUM 

GRACE, as he just hesitates. 

Had put you that solemn question? No, Sir Ralph, 
Mr. Ashdown has satisfied me that it was before. 

SIR RALPH. 

Satisfied you ? How ? 

GRACE 

By his comparison of notes with me, and by his positive 
declaration. 

SIR RALPH. 

His positive declaration's a lie. 

GRACE, after an instant. 

Will you say that to him f 

SIR RALPH. 

With all the pleasure in life ! 

GRACE, passing to the kitchen. 

Then 111 call him to hear it ! 

SIR RALPH, as she reaches the door. 
A moment, Madam. (Then after an instant abrupt, as she stops with 
her hand on the latch.) What is it yOU Want ? 

GRACE, vague an instant 

Want? 

SIR RALPH. 

To let me alone. (As she leaves the door.) 1 askcd you that, 
you know, at Courtlands. 



ACT SECOND 129 

GRACE. 
Yes, and I told you to guess. 

SIR RALPH, after an inslant. 

I couldn't guess so soon. 

GRACE. 

Can you guess at present ? 

SIR RALPH, after consideration. 

Fifty pounds ? 

GRACE, echoing, stupefied. 

Fifty pounds ? 

SIR RALPH. 
Not enough ? A hundred ? (Then at a loss ; as she only stands 
looking at him.) It's UOt mouey ? (As if with a fuller vision of the real 
question and his inevitable fate.) It's the Other thing ? 

GRACE, back at the kitchen, while Mark Bbrnal reappears. 

It's the other thing ! 

Exit Grace Jbsmond. 
SIR RALPH, aghast, fatalistic, to htniself, as Bernal comes in. 

Marriage ! 

Re-enter Mark Bernal from the street. 

BERNAL, struck, arrested by Sir Ralph's appearance and discomposure ; 
speaking with the note of real anxiety. 

She has proposed ? 

SIR RALPH, throwing up his arms from his sides and letting them fall. 

She has proposed ! 

VOL. II K 



I30 THE ALBUM 

BERNAL, dismayed, credulous. 

And youVe accepted ? 

SIR RALPH. 

IVe asked for a minute 1 

BERNAL, wonderstruck, turning it over. 

A minute? 

SIR RALPH. 

To decide — to think 1 

BERNAL, uneasy, painfully mystified ; throwing himself quickly, in the 
interest of delay, of diversion, into the question of the portrait ; shifting 
his easeL 

That's it — ^you'll decide at your ease ; you'll think while 
you sit ! 

SIR RALPH. 
T\\ be hanged if I'll sit ! (Then after an instant, while Bbrnal 
stares with dismay.) At any rate not here. (As Teddy reappears : 
re-enter Teddy Ashdown from the kitchen.) I'll sit at home. 

TEDDY, surprised, ejaculating. 

At home ? 

SIR RALPH, looking very hard at Teddy. 

At home. 



TEDDY, mystified, bewildered by the way Sir Ralph glares at him, 
fascinatedly returns his stare ; then to Bernal. 



May I go out ? 



ACT SECOND 131 

SIR RALPH, precipitately interposing. 

Go out ? Never ! 

BERNAL, surprised, pleading. 

Dear Ralph, it's his day ! 

SIR RALPH, in alarm. 
His " day '' ? (Then, while the two ladies reappear ; as if everything is 
overwhelmingly against him.) Mercy Ofl US ! 

Re-enter Lady Bassbt and Maud Vannbck from the parlour, dressed for 
departure. 

TEDDY, delighted. 
I'll go with them I (Then to the ladies, indicating Sir Ralph.) 

He'll sit at home ! 

LADY BASSET. 
At hOD[ie ? ((^ming down to Sir Ralph, who, on the right,^has collapsed 

upon the sofa.) I shall bc there ! 

Exit Lady Basset to the street, the door to which Bbrnal holds open. 
MAUD, coming down to Sir Ralph ; disgusted. 

I shall noil 

She goes up as Bernal comes down, and is received by Teddy, who offers her 
his arm. Exeunt Teddy Ashdown and Maud Vannbck to the street. 

SIR RALPH, who has sat engulfed in reflections, wholly heedless of what the 
two women have said to him, rises grave and pale ; then to Bernal. 

IVe decided ! 

BERNAL. eager. 

You refuse ? 



132 THE ALBUM 

SIR RALPH, I 



I accept! 

BERNAL,« 
On the spot ? 

SIR RALPH. 
It's to come ! (Uftbig and droppatg his aias to his sides as before.) 
Z^/ It come ! (Then as Gkack reappean : re-enter Gkacb Jbsmond 
from the kitchen, dressed to ga) MisS JCSmOIld ! 

BERN AL, still more alert, antidpatrng, interposing. 

Miss Jesmond ! 

SIR RALPH, while Gkacb, surprised, ancsfced by the intensity of Bbknal's 
tooe, stands looking from one of the men to the other. 

I've something to say to you. 

BERNAL, strenuous, insistent, with a gravity and anxiety altogether new, like 
his whole aspect and manner in what follows. 

Tvt something to say first ! 

GRACE, uncertain. 

To mf, Mr. Bemal ? 

BERNAL, indicating Ralph. 

To him ! (Then very urgent.) While I say it will you kindly 
wait? 

GRACE, stiU more vague. 

Wait? 

BERN AL, who has opened the door of the parlour. 

In there! (Gracb hesitates an instant, looking in the same wondering per- 
plexity from one of the men to the other. Then, after resting her eyes intensely 
on Bbrnal's, she abruptly decides and goes quickly into the parlour. Bbrnal 



ACT SECOND 133 

closes the door on her and, with his eyes on Sir Ralph, stands a moment holding 
the handle. Then coming down with decision, and with the rising passion of all 

his doubt m the question.) That girl — after your fortune ? 

SIR RALPH. 

After my fortune— -End (hesitating an instant, as if in resentment at 
that's being thought his only attraction, while he smartly taps his breast) 

after me! 

BERNAL, worried, frowning, challenging, incredulous. 

You say she proposed ? 

SIR RALPH, very definite. 

She made me an offer ! 

BERNAL. 

But of what ? 

SIR RALPH. 

Why, of her hand — and her person. 

BERNAL, amazed. 

You didn't understand her ! 

SIR RALPH. 

It was painfully clear. 

BERNAL, after an instant. 

My dear Ralph — I don't believe it ! 

SIR RALPH, after another instant. 

You impute to me — ^misrepresentation ? 



134 THE ALBUM 

BERNAL. 
I impute to you — ^aberration ! (Tben as if he can't get over it.) 

You intend to marry her ? 

SIR RALPH, fully detennbed ; as if with the resignation of the highest 
wisdom and enlightenment. 

It will keep her quiet ! 

BERNAL, dissuaave, ironic 

An intrigante— oi a dangerous type ? 

SIR RALPH, demonstrating his cleverness. 

I conjure the danger away ! 

BERNAL, almost derisive. 

A hungry adventuress ? 

SIR RALPH. 
I thought you contested that ! (Then as Bernal, in his agitation, 

moves nervously away.) She has beauty — and mind ! 

BERNAL, echoing, realising. 
Beauty and mind ! (Then in a different tone, with high decision.) 

My dear fellow, you mustn't do it ! 

SIR RALPH, irritated at his opposition. 

To oblige you f 

BERNAL, after an instant. 

To oblige me ! 

SIR RALPH. 

Pray, are you in love with her ? 



ACT SECOND 135 

BERNAL, evasive. 
If I am, it's your fault (As ifU settles the matter.) YoU told 

me to be ! 

SIR RALPH, positive. 

I told you to pull up ! 

BERNAL. 

It was too late to pull up — ^and it's too late now. 

SIR RALPH, more uneasy, suspicious, wondering. 

Now? 

BERNAL, smiling. 

I want to keep on ! 

SIR RALPH,. in still deeper disapproval and alarm. 

Paying your court ? 

BERNAL. 

Paying my court ! 

SIR RALPH. 

To make her your wife ? 

BERNAU 
To make her (in deep uncertainty, agitation, distraction, faltering) I'll 

be hanged if I know what ! 

SIR RALPH, as if following up an advantage and looking about him in 
reprobation. 

The partner of your misery ? 

BERNAL, in despair, troubled, impatient compunction. 

Yes Pm too deadly poor ! (Then after an instant, with returning 

clearness and resolution.) But I do kuOW what I Want. I 

want to prevent you ! 



136 THE ALBUM 

SIR RALPH, wound up, taking up the challenge. 
You shan't prevent me ! (Then at the door of the parlour, which he 
has quickly opened.) MisS Jesmond ! 

BERNAL, as quickly opening the door to the street, while Grace reappears. 

Miss Jesmond ! 

Re-enter Grace Jesmond. 
SIR RALPH, pressing. 

Will you do me a favour ? 

BERNAL, forestalling her answer ; passionate. 

Will you do me one first ? 

GRACE, still more mystified by their heated aspect ; looking from one to the 
other and then addressing Bernau 

Anything — for you / 

BERNAL. 

Then walk out of the house ! 

GRACE, startled, pained, for the moment, by the manner of the request. 

Out of the house — ? 

BERNAL, feverishly peremptory ; pointing to the open door. 

This moment ! 

GRACE, looking once more from one of the men to the other as they stand on 
either side of the stage ; then, with a visible effort, deciding and sadly, 
supremely addressing Bernal. 

Good-bye ! 

Exit Grace Jesmond, while the two men stand defiantly confronted. 



ACT THIRD 

Sir Ralph Damant's drawng-room in Portland Place ; hand- 
some, cold, conventional and characteristic. A door at the centre 
from the hall and staircase ; doors right and left from other reception 
rooms. 

Gracb Jbsmond is seated in her hat and cape ; not the same garments as in 
Act Second, but, as to mourning, perceptibly modified and brightened. The 
Footman who has appeared in Act First enters from the hall. 

FOOTMAN. 

I find Sir Ralph is not at home, Miss; but he gave 
orders that if you should call you were to be particularly 
asked to wait. 

GRACE. 

Till he comes in ? 

FOOTMAN. 

He may be expected at any moment. 

GRACE, after an instant. 

When were these orders given ? 

FOOTMAN. 

On Thursday, Miss, on our return from Vandyke Lodge. 

(Then expansive, as if glad of an opportunity to converse.) I waS there 

with the carriage — and I joined in the chase. 



138 THE ALBUM 

GRACE, struck. 

The chase ? 

FOOTMAN. 

For you, Miss. Sir Ralph drove hard — to catch up 
with you. 

GRACE, after an .instant; quiet. 

He didn't catch up. 

FOOTMAN, smUing. 

We had wasted precious moments. 

GRACE. 

You mustn't waste them now. 

FOOTMAN. 

He remarked that you'd turn up ! 

GRACE, after reflection. 

Since I'm expected, I'll wait. 

FOOTMAN, increasingly sociable. 

We've another party in another room. 

GRACE, rising, wondering. 

Another party ? 

FOOTMAN. 

From Vandyke Lodge. 

GRACE, startled, changing her mind. 

I believe, after all, I won't wait ! 



ACT THIRD 139 



FOOTMAN, as Tkddy appears. 

Here's the other party. 



Oh! 



Enter Teddy Ash down from the right 
GRACE, dropping into her chair again with relief. 



TEDDY, much pleased. 

You're just the person I want I 

FOOTMAN, privately; ironical. 

All of 'em ? Gracious ! 

Exit the Footman to the hall. 
GRACE, rising again ; anxious. 

Is Mr. Bernal here ? 

TEDDY. 

He'd be if he suspected you are ! I'm looking for him, 
and he's looking for Miss Jesmond. 

GRACE. 

He's coming for the portrait ? 

TEDDY. 

By appointment. They've patched it up. 

GRACE, vague. 

The portrait ? 

TEDDY. 

Oh no — their quarrel ! 

GRACE, still vague. 

Their quarrel ? 



140 THE ALBUM 

TEDDY. 
About you ! I know what happened. 



GRACE. 
That's more than I do, Mr. Ashdown ! 

TEDDY. 

Then I'll tell you. 

GRACE, postponing. 

When does Mr. Bemal come ? 

TEDDY, looking at his watch. 

Not till twelve. He put me on a 'bus with the traps — 
they're all in there, (indicating the adjoining room.) He's 
walking to save the fare. 

GRACE. 

Then he'll take some time ? - 

TEDDY. 

He crawls along — because he looks out for you in the 
streets. He peeps under every bonnet ! He has sent 
me to all those fellows for news of you. 

GRACE. 

The artists ? I've been to none of them. 

TEDDY. 

He said you'd require to go. 

GRACE. 
I do " require " ! (Then after an instant.) But I dou't gO. 



ACT THIRD - 141 

TEDDY, after a moment. 

You come here instead. 

GRACE. 
I come here instead. 

TEDDY. 

But not, I fear, for Mark. 

GRACE. 

Not for Mr. Bernal. For Sir Ralph Damant 

TEDDY, after another moment. 

Was it for Sir Ralph you came to us ? 
GRACE. 

It was for myself. 

TEDDY. 

That was what their row was about — when Mark was so 
rude. 

GRACE. 
How rude was Mr. Bernal ? 

TEDDY. 

Rude enough to repent ! , He has repented fearfully of 
what he did to you. 

GRACE, after an instant. 

He asked me to leave his house. 

TEDDY. 

Oh, he has told me ; he talks of nothing else ! 



142 THE ALBUM 

GRACE. 
I've talked of it — to no one. 

TEDDY, alert. 

Then you've forgiven him ? 

GRACE, with the same smile. 

I've forgiven him. 

TEDDY, with the same eagerness. 

May I tell him, when he comes ? 

GRACE, after an instant. 

IVe asked you before to keep a secret. 

TEDDY. 
About that sketch-book? (With emphatic satisfaction.) I've 

kept it ! 

GRACE. 

Beautifully. Then keep this one. 

TEDDY, vague. 

Your forgiving him ? 

GRACE. 

My being in this place. I wish not to see him. 

TEDDY, perceptibly mystified. 

And yet you remain ? 



ACT THIRD 143 

GRACE. 

Only for one reason, — that if I go now I shall not have 
courage to return. 

TEDDY. 
"Courage"? 

GRACE. 

It was not easy ! 

TEDDY. 

To face Sir Ralph ? Why, / have to ! 

GRACE, after a moment. 

Yes — you have to. 

TEDDY. 

I do it for Mark ! 

GRACE, after an instant ; with her tired smile. 

And / do it for " Mark " ! To render him a service. 

TEDDY, eager. 

Then you like hira ? 

GRACE, hesitating, but still smiling. 

You ask too many questions 1 

TEDDY. 

I asked that one because he likes you 

GRACE. 

I guessed so when he turned me out. 



144 THE ALBUM 

TEDDY. 
Did you ? He has been afraid you wouldn't ! 

GRACE. 
I didn't at first But then I thought about it. 

TEDDY, sympathetically interested. 

And then it came to you ? 

GRACE. 

Little by little. (After a moment.) It Came to me last night. 

TEDDY. 

And that brought you here ? 

GRACE. 

Early, as you see. To acknowledge his favour ! 

TEDDY. 

But how — ^if you don't meet him ? 

GRACE. 

I shall meet Sir Ralph. 

TEDDY, alert. 

Meet him and refuse him ? 



GRACE, consciously blank. 

" Refuse " him ? 



TEDDY, surprised at her blankness. 

Doesn't he want to marry you ? 



ACT THIRD 145 

GRACE, grave. 

Quite the contrary ! 

TEDDY. 

And you don't want it ? 

GRACE, with controlled emotion ; after an instant. 

Has he asserted that ? 

TEDDY. 

To Mark — on Thursday. You made him an offer. 

GRACE, rising quickly. 

Which he saw reason to accept — precisely ! 

TEDDY. 

It was why Mark banished you. To separate the parties 
— to avert the danger ! 

GRACE. 
To prevent Sir Ralph's accepting ? 

TEDDY. 

To choke him right off! 

GRACE, eager. 

Mr. Bernal believed it ? 

TEDDY, vague. 

That Sir Ralph would? 

VOL. II L 



146 THE ALBUM 

GRACE. 
No — ^that I had done such a thing. 

TEDDY, after an instant's reflectioo. 

It didn't prevent him from wanting you — 

GRACE, as he modestly pauses. 

" Wanting " me ? 

TEDDY. 

For his own use ! 

GRACE, dropping into a seat again ; sitting there an instant in thought : then 
rising and with frankness and courage, as well as with a forced gaiety in- 
tended to dissimulate her sadness and make her discussion of such a matter 
with Teddy pass. 

Mr. Bernal may "want" me, Mr. Ashdown; but Mr. 
Bernal can't have me 1 

TEDDY, vague, disappointed. 

Can't have you ? 

GRACE. 

It ties my hands. 

TEDDY, hlank. 

I don't understand I 

GRACE. 

I do — at last ! I had thought it all out — but you 
greatly help me. 

TEDDY, kind, simple, loyal. 

I want to greatly help you. 

GRACE. 

You did so, you know, at Courtlands. 



ACT THIRD 147 

TEDDY. 
By holding my tongue ? It was hard ! 

GRACE. 
I shall set you to-day an easier task. You will be so 
good as to speak. 

TEDDY, alert. 

Tell Mr. Bemal— ? 

GRACE, tnterrnpciiig. 

That Fm in the house. 

TEDDY. 

But where shall you be ? 

GRACE, at a momentary loss ; looking round her, then pointing to the door 
on the left. 

In there. 

TEDDY. 

Why not in here ? 

GRACE. 

So you may prepare him. 

TEDDY, blank. 

" Prepare " him ? 

GRACE. 

Give him his choice — of seeing me or not. 

TEDDY, laughing. 

He'll take it ! (Then more gravely.) And if I speak for you, 
will you speak for me ? 



I4S THE ALBUM 

GRACE. 



To whom ? 

TEDDY. 

To " dear Maud." I want her — for my own use !

I'll make you one !

GRACE, startled. 

Coming up ? 

FOOTMAN, who has crossed to the door on the left, which he has opened. 

If you'll pass in there. 

TEDDY, anxious, while Grace reaches the other room. 

Can I trust you ? 

GRACE, at the door, with a smile. 

If you can trust her ! 

Exit Grace Jesmono to the left. 
FOOTMAN, explaining, after closing the door on her. 

Sir Ralph's orders. 

^TEDDY, vague. 

His orders ? 



ACT THIRD 149 

FOOTMAN. 
If Mr. Bemal should come. 

TEDDY, disconcerted. 

He's not to see her ? 

FOOTMAN, self-complacent, responsible. 

For fear of complications ! 

TEDDY, disgusted ; thinking. 

Why, what does Sir Ralph call that^ (Then seeing Bernal,) 
Silence ! 

Enter Mark Bbknal from the hall. Exit the Footman to the hall. 
BERNAL. 

Ralph's not here ? 

TEDDY. 

I've been waiting. 

BERNAL. 

With everything ready ? 

Teddy, embarrassed, at fault. 

Not yet ; I thought — 

BERNAL, breaking in ; with kindly impatience. 

You think too much you always did I (Then indicating the 

door on the right.) Be quick ! 

TEDDY, demurring, hesitating. 

Before I go — 



ISO THE ALBUM 

BERNAL, as he pauses. 

Before you go ? 

TEDDY. 

Miss Jesmond's in the house 1 

BERNAL, amazed. 

Here ? — ^now ? 

TEDDY. 

She told me to tell you. 

BERNAL. eager. 

Then I can see her ? 

TEDDY. 

You can see her. 

BERNAL, struck, in the midst of his relief ; mistrustful, wondering. 

But what's she doing ? 

TEDDY, vague. 

Doing ? 

BERNAL. 

For what purpose has she come ? 

TEDDY. 

For the purpose of helping you. 

BERNAL, blank. 

But how in the world — ? 

TEDDY. 

I give it up ! 



ACT THIRD 151 

BERNAL, uneasy, peremptory ; suddenly nervous and discomposed ; passing 
hb hand over his head. 

Make ready ! 

Re-enter, as he speaks, the Footman from the hall. 
SERVANT, announcing. 

Lady Basset ! 

BERNAL, starting, as if strudc with a quick idea, then still more imperative, to 
Tbddy, who has lingered, looking at him, with a hand on the door at 
the right. 

Leave us ! 



E^it Tbddy Ashdown to the right. Enter Lady Basset from the hall. 
Exit the Footman. 



BERNAL, as if amused. 

How did you get in ? 

LADY BASSET. 

The butler passed me up. Uubiiant, exultant.) Tm invited ! 

BERNAL. 

By Sir Ralph ? 

LADY BASSET. 

By Sir Ralph. (Triumphant.) He wants me ! 

BERNAL, surprised. 

For what ? 

LADY BASSET, with.lively confidence. 

You'll see when he comes ! 



152 THE ALBUM 

BERNAL. 
But he doesn't come ! (Looking at hu watch.) You must 
help me to bear it 

LADY BASSET, self-complacent, coquettish. 

I helped you, you know, to bear it the other day ! 

BERNAL, preoccupied with the idea of Grace's presence. 

Indeed you did — immensely ! 

LADY BASSET. 

We had recourse to my artistic nature. 

BERNAL, vague. 

Do you wish to have recourse to it again ? 

LADY BASSET, after serious reflection. 
Not to the same extent. (Then with serenity and lucidity.) If 

I was present the other day as an artist, I'm present 
to-day as a woman. 

BERNAL, with the same vagueness as before. 

Is it in that capacity he has sent for you ? 

LADY BASSET, bUnk. 

In what other capacity, pray — ? (After an instant.) The 
very servants recognise it ! 

BERNAL, not following. 

Recognise it — ? 

LADY BASSET. 

By their eagerness to usher me in ! 



ACT THIRD 153 

BERNAL, suddenly struck ; wkh a light. 

In here — to me^ 

LADY BASSET, vague, surprised at the point he makes of this. 

They mentioned I should find you 1 

BERNAL, as the fuller light breaks upon him ; with amused elation ; 
seizing her arm. 

That's what he wanted of you ! 

LADY BASSET, blank, disconcerted. 

To amuse you ? 

BERNAL. 

To captivate me — as he wants me to captivate you ! 

LADY BASSET, candid, jovial. 

You do, my dear man ! 

BERNAL, Uughing. 

And so do you ! 

LADY BASSET. 

But why does Sir Ralph desire it ? 

BERNAL 

To protect himself. He fears you. 

LADY BASSET, exultant. 

I feel that he does ! 

BERNAL, amused and relieved by his discovery. 

I see it all ! 



154 THE ALBUM 

LADY BASSET. 
All what ? 

BERNAL. 

Why, he means you to draw me off ! 

LADY BASSET, vague. 

Off somebody else ? 

BERNAL, smUing. 

A person he wants for himself! 

LADY BASSET, struck, alarmed. 

For himself? (Then with quick dismay.) Maud Vanneck ? 

BERNAL, amused. 

No, not Maud Vanneck. 

LADY BASSET, thinking ; then with eager intensity. 

Grace Jesmond ? 

BERNAL. 

She's in the house I 

LADY BASSET, still more alarmed. 

Invited ? 

BERNAL. 

No, not invited — he hasn't her address. 

LADY BASSET. 

She has come of herself? 

BERNAL, after an instant, as if recognising the full gravity of this. 

She has come of herself. 



ACT THIRD I5S 

LADY BASSET, stupefied, scandalised. 

What effrontery ! 

BERNAL. 
Her reason is doubtless good. 

LADY BASSET, as if struck with the tone in which he says this. 

You're in love with her ? 

BERNAL. 

Ralph thinks so. 

LADY BASSET, imperative. 

Then for God's sake marry her ! 

BERNAL, after an instant ; troubled, sincere. 

How can I — ^in my position ? 

LADY BASSET, coinciding. 

Yes — she's after money. (Then with decision.) But she won't 
get it ! 

BERNAU 

Do you mean that you will ? 

LADY BASSET, after an instant. 

Sir Ralph is pledged to me. 

BERNAL, uncertain, bewildered, nervous. 

Then why does he want her ? 

LADY BASSET, blank a moment ; then with resentment. 

Because he's false ! 



IS6 THE ALBUM 

BERNAL, pleading:. 

Ah, no — ^he's honest ! (After an instant.) See .how he makes 
us meet ! 

LADY BASSET. 

You and me ? 

BERNAL. 

For you to swallow me up 1 

LADY BASSET, impressed with the unsuspected truth. 

And you to swallow me f 

BERNAL, smiling. 

So that you won't have room (or him/ (After an instant.) 
You admitted just now that there wasn't much ! 

LADY BASSET, with decision. 

You're a very brilliant man, but I reject you. 

BERNAL. 

Ralph has counted on your appreciating me enough — 

(Hesitating, pausing, as if with a last scruple ; then in a changed tone.) Hang 

it — I can tell you now / 

LADY BASSET, eager. 

To let Sir Ralph off? 

BERNAL. 

To be merciful. 

LADY BASSET. 

For the benefit of that creature ? Never ! 

BERNAL 

You really hold out ? 



ACT THIRD 157 

LADY BASSET. 

Against you ? I loathe you ! 

BERNAL. 

And you permit me to loathe back ? 

LADY BASSET. 

If you love another woman ! 

BERNAL. 

I haven't told you I do ! 

LADY BASSET. 

That's because you're such a flirt. You won't part with 
one victim — 

BERNAL, laughing, intemipting. 
Before I make sure of another ? (Then again preoccupied.) 

Yes, I must make sure. (After an instant.) And while I'm 
making sure — 

LADY BASSET. 

/ shall be doing the same ! 

BERNAL, amused. 

You'll be all there ? 

LADY BASSET, with clear resolution. 

All here ! 

BERNAL, after a moment's intense reflection ; going up to the bell, 
which he ring . 

I must see my way ! 



158 THE ALBUM 

LADY BASSET, T»guc 

What are you doing? 

BERNAL. 
I'm making sure ! (Re-enter the Footman from the halL To the 

Footman.) Am I correct in believing that Miss Jesmond's 
in the house ? 

FOOTMAN, embarrassed. 

Did the young gentleman tell you, sir ? 

BERNAL. 
Of course the young gentleman told me. 

FOOTMAN. 

Would it do for me, then, to deny it ? 

BERNAL, staring. 

Deny it ? Why should you deny it ? 

FOOTMAN. 

Because Sir Ralph said she wasn't to see you. 

BERNAL, struck ; then with high decision. 

Then he should be at home to prevent it ! 

FOOTMAN. 

He may be at any moment, sir. 

BERNAL. 

Then I must see her quickly ! 



ACT THIRD 159 

FOOTMAN, 
ril inform her. 

Exit the Footman to the left, leaving the door open. 
LADY BASSET. 

She can scarcely be said to shrink ! 

BERNAL, amused. 

If you compare it with your shrinkage ! 

LADY BASSET. 

Mine, such as it is, forbids me to witness your en- 
counter ! 

BERNAL, indicating the room on the right. 

Then kindly pass in there. 

LADY BASSET, vaguely demurring. 

In there ? 

BERNAL. 

Where Sir Ralph's to sit. 

LADY BASSET, at the door, alert. 

ru wait for him ! 

Exit Lady Basset to the right. Re-enter Grace Jesmond from the left. 
GRACE, pausing where she enters. 

I asked Mr. Ashdown to tell you of my presence — 
strange as it must inevitably appear to you. 



i6o THE ALBUM 

BERNAL. 
As your presence must appear ? 

GRACK 

No — as my request to him must. 

BERNAL. 

In the light of the extraordinary leave I last asked you 
to take of me ? If s to explain that monstrous proceed- 
ing that I have begged for these words with you. IVe 
hunted for you hard, but in vain — to make you hear 
them. 

GRACE. 

There is a word I myself should like to speak. (After an 
instont) The simple request to you to believe — 

BERNAL, waiting, as she pauses. 

To believe ? 

GRACE. 

Nothing Sir Ralph Damant may say of me. 

BERNAL. 

You're aware then of what he has in fact said ? 

GRACE. 

It's because I think I divine it that IVe come here. 

BERNAL, after an instant. 

Not, I suppose, at his request. 

GRACE. 

He couldn't request me — in ignorance of where to find 
me. 



ACT THIRD i6i 

BERNAL. 
The ignorance youVe me to thank for ! 

GRACE. 

As I do thank you, Mr. Bernal. 

BERNAL. 

You thank me for showing you the door, for turning you 
out of my house ? — ^turning you without mercy into the 
great city you had scoured in vain, and in which I 
myself soon enough cursed the folly that had deprived 
me of a possible clue to you ? 

GRACE. 

We meet again in spite of that folly. 

BERNAL. 

We meet again in spite of it. (Then after an instant.) But we 
meet again in a manner to which it would take but little 
more of my perplexity to make me prefer our separation. 

GRACE, after a hesitation. 

Is that because you do believe Sir Ralph ? 

BERNAL. 

If he has told me a strange story of you, why do you, 
on your side, take a step which gives a detestable 
colour to it ? 

GRACE. 

This step of coming to see him ? Because it's the only 
way to say to him — something that I have to say. 

VOL. II « M 



i62 THE ALBUM 

BERNAU 

IVe no right whatever to ask you what that may be. 

GRACE. 

IVe a limited power, none the less, to tell you. He has 
misunderstood me ; and it is important to me that he 
should be informed that he has. 

BERNAL. 
Important ? (Then after an instant, half-impatient, half-pleading.) Ah, 

why is it important ? 

GRACE, hesitating, momentarily embarrassed. 

Fm afraid I can only say to you — because I hold it to be ! 

BERNAL, with an apo]&lt;^etic, penitent gesture. 

I insult you with my curiosity when I only wanted to 
convince you of my regret. • It was my respect for you 
the other day, that made me use a freedom ! 

GRACE. 
The sense of that respect consoles me ! 

BERNAL 

I'm delighted to hear it ; but what's to console me ? 

GRACE, after an instant. 

For what, Mr. Bernal ? 



ACT THIRD 163 

BERNAl. 
For seeing Sir Ralph Damant again stand between us ! 

GRACE, after another instant. 

Excuse me if I don't perceive how it should matter to 
you where Sir Ralph Damant stands. 

BERNAL. 

You saw how it mattered the other day ! 

GRACE, quiet. 
I saw the fact, but not the reason. (Then with a sad smile.) 

You ask me, I think, for more explanations than you 
give ! 

BERNAL, admitting this ; speaking very kindly. 

You must be generous with me, for I'm much troubled. 

GRACE. 

It's because you're much troubled that I*m here. (Then 

while he stares ; explaining.) J saw yOUr pOOr home the Other 

day, and I heard your confession. 

BERNAL, struck, alert. 

Of want of means ? 

GRACE, tender, indulgent. 

My intrusion, my appeal brought it out. 

BERNAL. 

So that you're here for money ? 



i64 THE ALBUM 

GRACE, after an instant. 

I'm here for money ! 

BERNAL, wondering, amazed. 

For my relief? 

GRACE, after another pause. 

Are you too proud to accept relief? 

BERNAU 

If I'm proud at all, Miss Jesmond, I'm proud of having 
inspired — by such an accident — such a sympathy ! 

(After an instant.) Your charity is (hesiuting for his word ; then bring- 
ing it out with an extravagance of warmth in which there is just a shade of the 
irony of his imperfect credulity, his sense of strangeness) magnificent ! • 

GRACE, gentle. 

Such as it is, it's all my motive ! 

BERNAL, going on. 

Still more rriagnificent is your belief in my cousin's 
sensibility. 

GRACE. 

You mean it's extravagant ? (After an instant.) It would be 
— ^if I hadn't grounds for it. 

BERNAL, struck. 

Grounds ? (then after reflection.) Shall I Strike you as the 
most graceless of men if I venture to ask what they are ? 

GRACE. 

I can't tell you, Mr. Bernal, what they are ! 



ACT THIRD 165 

BERNAL. 

And yet you said just now that you give more explana- 
tions — 

GRACE, as he hesitates. 
Than you do ? (After an instant.) I waS WFOUg. (With pathetic 

dignity.) I fecl that I don't give enough ! 

BERNAL, worried, agitated, almost feverish. 

You give enough to enchant me, but not enough to 
satisfy ! Why should you wish to remedy my preposter- 
ous predicament? 

GRACE. 

Because I regret it ! 

BERNAL, with the same troubled spirit as before. 

Your "regret" is more mystifying than the step for 
which it accounts, and your good faith* only ministers, 
somehow, to the impulse that makes me challenge you ! 

GRACE. 
My ambiguity is my misfortune. 

BERNAL. 

Say rather it's mine ! If I appealed to you just now 
kindly to see me, it was to make my own behaviour 
clear. How can I make it clear — 

GRACE, interrupting. 

If I don't make mine ? — You can't ! 



i66 THE ALBUM 

Enter Sir Ralph Damant from the hall. Re-enter at the same moment 
Lady Basset from the right. 

BERNAL, to Sir Ralph, who has his latchkey visible and has stopi&gt;ed short, 
deq&gt;Iy disconcerted, on finding him with Grace. 

I asked to see Miss Jesmond. 

GRACE, to Sir Ralph. 

I arrived before Mr. Bemal 

LADY BASSET, on the right. 

/ arrived after ! 

SIR RALPH. 

And I've arrived last of all ! (Controlling with an effort, as he comes 
down, his discomfiture at Mark's meeting with Grace, and taking now the 
line of a smoothly astute and diplomatic manner of dealing with his difficulties.) 

IVe been detained, but I'm all the more pleased to find 
you gathered ! 

GRACE, grave. 

I've not presumed you'd care to find me, 

SIR RALPH, urbane, engaging, gay. 

Then I must teach you presumption ! I bid you 
welcome to Portland Place. 

LADY BASSET, impatient but majestic 

And have you no welcome for another friend ? 

SIR RALPH. 

The warmest, dear lady. I summoned you to be 
present at the sittings. 

LADY BASSET, disappointed at the inadequacy of this explanation. 

I should still have been if you hadn't ! 



ACT THIRD 167 

SIR RALPH, imperturbable ; indicating the room on the right. 
They take place there. (Then motioning her to pass out again.) 

Be so good as to await me. 

LADY BASSET. 

While you dally with Miss Jesmond ? 

SIR RALPH, answering the question but addressing Grace. 

To make up for the occasion of which Mark so cruelly 
deprived me ! 

BERNAL, gay. 

IVe made up a little, on my side, for the loss I equally 
suffered ! 

SIR RALPH. 
I take my revenge in kind ! (Opening the door on the right and 

pointing the way out to bbrnal.) Be SO good as to leave the 
room. 

BERNAL, troubled, demurring. 

This moment ? 

SIR RALPH. 

This moment ! 

BERNAL, at the door ; looking at Grace ; after an instant. 

Good-bye ! 

Exit Mark Bbrnal to the right. 

SIR RALPH, to Lady Basset, while Grace, with emotion, nervous, restless, 
wanders up to a window on the left. 

Won't you join him ? (Then as her attitude appears a refusal ; in- 
sinuating.) He admires you ! 



i68 THE ALBUM 

LADY a\SSET. daring ; as if stupefied. 

Do you mean by that that you don't ? 

SIR RALPH, mnriliatnry, heroic 

My admiration's of a difierent strain ! 

LADY BASSET. 

Such as it isy I'm here for you to show it 

SIR RALPH. 

I do show it 1 am showing it (Then as he indicates the open 

door and other room again.) By this privilege ! 

LADY BASSET. 

That of Mr. Bemal's company ? 

SIR RALPH, pleadingly argumentative. 

Doesn't he tell you what he thinks of you ? 

LADY BASSET. 

Every one does that ! 

SIR RALPH, still pleading. 

/ will — in three minutes ! 

LADY BASSET, at the door ; having looked at her watch. 

I shall time you ! 

Exit Lady Basset to the right. 

SIR RALPH, having closed the door and remaining an instant at the right, 
while Grace is up at the left. 

I followed you in vain, and it was sweet of you to come ! 



ACT THIRD 169 

GRACE, coming down. 

It may have been "sweet," Sir Ralph, but it has not 
been easy 1 

SIR RALPH. 

It gives me the chance to say what I wanted so much 
to say ! • 

GRACE, seating herself. 

And it gives me the chance to hear it ! 

SIR RALPH. 

What I wanted to say is that I accept your proposition. 

GRACE. 

Are you very sure, first, that you understand it ? 

SIR RALPH, surprised at her question. 

There was surely little room to blink it ! (Then after an 
instant.) And IVe taken my time to consider. 

GRACE, very quiet. 

I gather then the fruit of my exertions. 

SIR RALPH. 

If your exertions were extraordinary, you must admit 
that the fruit is splendid ! 

GRACE. 

There's nothing so splendid as the triumph of justice. 



I70 THE ALBUM 

SIR RALPH, struck, demurring. 

Do you call it by that name ? 

GRACE. 

By what name do you call it ? 

SIR RALPH. 

Generosity — extravagant ! But we won't quarrel about 
the description ! 

GRACK 

We won't quarrel about anything, in the presence of the 
accomplished fact. 

SIR RALPH, wincing, momentarily failing. 

That's a description that, I confess, does give me a 

start ! (Reflecting with intense gravity.) It brings my pOSitiOH 

home to me. 

GRACE. 

Exactly where it should be brought. 

SIR RALPH. 

I'm a bit of a fatalist ; it's the finger of doom ! My 
line of argument has been that sooner or later I should 
feel the knife at my throat — have to make the sacrifice ; 
and that it constitutes after all the purchase of my 
freedom. 

GRACE. 

When you have paid the price your freedom will be 
perfect ! 

SIR RALPH, struck, eager. 

I may do as I like — I may go my way ? 



ACT THIRD 171 

GRACE. 
My dear Sir Ralph, I'll never speak to you ! 

SIR RALPH, following up the conception of this advantage ; thinking. 

And of course, on that footing, nobody else will ! (More 
confident.) Nobody elsc can ! 

GRACE, confirmatory. 

There'll be nothing left to say ! 

SIR RALPH. 

Precisely, no locus standi, (ingenuous.) That's the one 
thing that reconciles me. 

GRACE, after an instant. 
The one thing ? (Then as he stares, struck, incipiently alarmed by her 

intonation.) No Sentiment — no emotion ? 

SIR RALPH, still staring ; plainly surprised. 

Since you press me. Madam, none whatever ! 

GRACE. 

The mere bald concession ? 

SIR RALPH, more markedly surprised, even scandalised at her qualification 
of his sacrifice. 

Do you consider it such a trifle to "concede" my 
existence ? 

GRACE, blank. 

Your existence ? 



172 THE ALBUM 

SIR RALPH. 
Even with what I reserve! My fortune, my position, 
my name ! 

GRACE. 

Your name ? What have I to do with that ? 

SIR RALPH, bewildered. 

You don't propose to bear it ? 

GRACE, rising. 
Heaven forbid, Sir Ralph ! (Then Ughtly and quietly, as he stares, 

stupefied.) You make me an offer ? 

SIR RALPH, with precii»tate and indignant eagerness. 

Never in the world ! 

GRACE. 

Then what are you talking about ? 

SIR RALPH. 
Your horrible ultimatum ! 

GRACE, after an instant. 

It's your impression that I've made you an offer ? 

SIR RALPH. 

Twice over, in so many words ! 

GRACE. 

Which you've done me the honour to accept ? 

SIR RALPH. 

For the advantage I've named ! 



ACT THIRD 173 

GRACE, amused, smiling in spite of her disgust and dismay. 

Your view of the " advantage *' touches me ! I did make 
you an offer, Sir Ralph, but it was only the offer of a 
chance. 

SIR RALPH, vague, anxious. 

A chance ? 

GRACE. 

To make a restitution — to divide your inheritance. 

SIR RALPH, staring; with his assurance flickering back. 

Divide it with you ? 

GRACE. 

With Mr. Bernal. That was my " ultimatum " ! 

SIR RALPH, dropping, overwhelmed, into the seat from which Grace 
has risen. 

That? 

GRACE. 

I appealed to you to give him his share — the share he 
would clearly have enjoyed if your kinsman had lived 
another day. 

SIR RALPH, with the same amazed ruefulness. 

Make him a present of a fortune ? 

GRACE, simple. 

Two thousand a year. 

SIR RALPH, after an instant during which he has risen. 

So that you may offer to marry Aim ? 



174 THE ALBUM 

GRACE. 
You exaggerate my impatience to marry. 

SIR RALPH. 

You exaggerate mine to indulge in preposterous gifts ! 

GRACE, after an instant. 

You don't accept your chance ? 

SIR RALPH. 

You must permit me to view it in the light of reason 1 

GRACE. 

That's exactly what I appeal to you to do. You treated 
me just now to the argument of security. Let me treat 
you to the same ! Your security is your honour. 

SIR RALPH, after an insUnt. 

And my honour, you seem to imply, is your sport ? 

GRACE. 

I daresay I could have a game with it ! 

SIR RALPH, after another instant. 

With that little ass to help you ? 

GRACE. 

Mr. Ashdown ? He's in the other room. 

SIR RALPH, with excited derision 

Quite the Chamber of Horrors ! 



ACT THIRD 175 

GRACE. 
I should apply that title to this one. 

SIR RALPH, as she moves to go. 

You leave me, Miss Jesmond ? 

GRACE, at the door to the hall. 

I've corrected your mistake. 

SIR RALPH, still with his nervous and ironic laughter. 

Won't you give me your address ? 

GRACE, blank. 

For what purpose ? 

SIR RALPH. 

I may have a word to say to you ! 

GRACE, after an instant's hesitation. 

If you have a word to say, say it to Mr. Bernal ! 

SIR RALPH, smUing. 

It may not do — for Mr. Bernal ! 

GRACE, turning to the door again. 

Then it won't do for me ! 

SIR RALPH, as she has her hand on the door ; with a sudden complete, 
quite violent change of manner and accent. 

Miss Jesmond, listen to me ! (Then as Grace, struck, arrested 

by this transformation, stops short, looking at him.) YoU Say yOU've 



176 THE ALBUM 

corrected my mistake; but I confess I've jnade more 

than one ! (Grace, as if, after a momentary hesitation, under the influence 
of a puzzled hope that his oddly altered tone may denote his readiness to do the 
justice she has demanded, comes slowly a few steps down, while he goes 'on.) 

I told you a while ago that if I stood ready to marry 
you it was without sentiment, without emotion. But 
those words were a wrong to you — they were a greater 

wrong to myself. (She continues to rest her wondering, expectant eyes 
on him, and he proceeds with gathered assurance.) The emOtlon, 

charming woman, has come — the sentiment insists on 

a voice. (Then, under the permission of her silence, producing his confident 

climax.) I make you, Miss Jesmond, the proposal that I 
regret you didn't make me ! 

GRACE, after a moment of intensely controlled disappointment and horror ; 
with the cold irony of her stupefaction. 

Your mistakes are sufficiently strange ; but I think your 
corrections are stranger ! 

SIR RALPH, insistent, persistent. 

You say that you offer me a chance ; but what is it com- 
pared to the chance I offer you ? What you ask of me 

for another, I press on you for yourself ! (Then with an ex- 
asperation rising from the vision of the incorruptibility with which she stands 

there.) Do you measurc what I mean and what I possess ? 
Can you reflect on it and refuse ? I've guessed your 
poverty ; I've sounded your depths. Without a home, 
without protection in this cruel city, consider in what a 

refuge you stand ! (Then as she simply turns from him with a move- 
ment that expresses all her sickened inaccessibility, and he has got between her 
and the door to the hall, more and more urgent and imperative, half-pleading, 
half-resentful and altogether passionate.) YoU really refuse ? 



ACT THIRD 177 

GRACE. 

To be bought off ? (with an almost wild motion of clearing him from 
her path, while the door opens from the hall and the Footman reappears: 
re-enter the Footman from the hall.) Let me gO J 

FOOTMAN, announcing. 

Miss Vanneck ! 

Enter Maud Vanneck from the hall. 
SIR RALPH, disconcerted, overwhelmed, furious, to the Footman. 

Who let her in ? 

MAUD, serene. 

The butler, Sir Ralph ; I asked for Lady Basset ! 

FOOTMAN. 

Your things are put out, sir. 

SIR RALPH.' 

Things ? What things ? 

FOOTMAN. 

To sit for your picture, sir — the costoom. 

SIR RALPH. 

Damn the costoom ! 

Exit Sir Ralph rapidly to the hall, while the Footman holds open the door 
Exit the Footman. 

GRACE, to Maud. 

You asked for Lady Basset?

MAUD. 
To take me oat again. (After an mstut.) I find I can't 
face them! 

GRACE 

Face what? 

MAUD. 

The usual dangers. 

GRACE, with a sad, anccre smile and bcadsfaakc 

They're horrible ! Don't try. (Then after a moment.) Don't 
trouble Lady Basset 111 take you out 

MAUD, surprised. 

You, Miss Jesmond ? Where ? 

GRACE. 

Out of this house, to begin with. It's not a very nice 
place! 

MAUD, strack with her tone and air ; then kind. 

I see it has been horrid somehow (or you — ^and yet you 
have ideas for others. 

GRACE. 

I've ideas for Mr. Ashdown I He asked me to speak 
for him. 

MAUD. 

Is he here ? 

GRACE, turning away as she sees Bernal. 

Ask Mr. Bernal. 

Re-enter Mark Bernal from the right. 



ACT THIRD 179 

MAUD, joyous, spontaneous, to Bernal, who has stopped short on finding 
Grace still in the room. 

Why, Miss Jesmond's charming ! 

GRACE, facing about again quickly. 

She says so because I spoke to her of Mr. Ashdown. 

BERNAL, behind whom the door of the other room has closed ; to Maud. 

He's in there with Lady Basset. 

MAUD. 

And what's Lady Basset doing ? 

BERNAL. 

Waiting for Sir Ralph. 

MAUD, with striking ingenuousness. 

How very vulgar ! 

GRACE, to Bernal, smiling. 

Miss Vanneck's not here for that 1 

BERNAL, to Maud. 

It wouldn't help you if you were ! 

GRACE, to Bernal, urgent. 

You must appeal for your friend. 

BERNAL, to Grace. 

Your friend too, Miss Jesmond. He simply adores you. 



i8o THE ALBUM 

MAUD, struck. 

Does he indeed ? 

GRACE, amused. 

Because I intercede 1 

BERNAL. 

I've interceded too ! (To Maud.) Didn't I struggle hard 
for him ? 

MAUD. 

At Vandyke Lodge ? (After an instant.) I've not forgotten 
it! 

GRACE, to Maud. 

Let him struggle for himself ! 

BERNAL, to Maud. 

Shall I call him in ? 

MAUD, at the open door on the left ; hesitating ; then to Grace. 

What's beyond that room ? 

GRACE, smiling. 

A conservatory. 

MAUD, to Bernal. 

Please call him ! 

Exit Maud Vanneck to the left. Bernal opens door on the right, 
and on his summons re-enter Teddy Ashdown. 

GRACE, to Teddy. 

I've spoken for you ! 

TEDDY, eager. 

To dear Maud ? 



ACT THIRD i8i 

BERNAL, indicating the left. 

She's in the conservatory. 

TEDDY, at the door on the left, in suspense, his hand to his heart 

Will she have me ? 

BERNAL. 

Go and see ! 

TEDDY, aidenUy, to Grace. 

Benefactress ! 

GRACE, grave, sad. 

Ah, don't call me that/ 

TEDDY. 

Then angel ! 

BERNAL, laughing. 

Keep that for Miss Vanneck ! 

TEDDY, indicating Grace. 

Then you thank her ! 

Exit Teddy to the left. 
GRACE, smiling sadly. 

You shouldn't, for they haven't a penny ! 

BERNAL. 

What of that ? No more have we ! 

GRACE, vague. 

"We"? 

BERNAL, seeing Sir Ralph. 

It doesn't matter ! 



i82 THE ALBUM 

Re-enter Sir Ralph Damant picturesquely dressed to sit for his portrait ; a 
costume carefully selected and studied. 

SIR RALPH, stopping short, in high displeasure, on seeing Bernal 
reunited to Grace. 

You've come back ? 

BERNAL, with a gesture of abdication, of frank, final confession. 

My necessity forced me — I expected to find you. 
(After an instant.) I throw up my charge. 

SIR RALPH, aghast, kidicating the room to the right. 

That woman ? 

BERNAL. 

That avalanche ! I can't arrest its course ! 

SIR RALPH, dismayed, indignant. 

You don't appreciate her? 

BERNAL. 

I can't handle her, and I judged it right to notify you. 

SIR RALPH, thinking intently, in his alarm. 

She's not amenable — ? 

BERNAL. 

To any argument I can use ! 

SIR RALPH. 

But she has plenty of her own ! 

BERNAL. 

I perceive them, but somehow I resist them ! 



ACT THIRD 183 

SIR RALPH, contending, protesting, insbting. 

Such brilliant points ? 

BERNAL. 

She doesn't see mine ! 

SIR RALPH. 

You told me she did ! 

BERNAL. 

It was what she first told me ! But now she takes it 
all back. 

SIR RALPH, in deeper dismay the more he thinks. 

Back? 

BERNAL. 

She objects to me ! 

SIR RALPH. 

And you object to her 1 

BERNAL. 

I'm not so rude as to tell her so — but I do ! 

SIR RALPH, in the tone of indignant injury ; scandalised. 

Do you call such an objection loyal ? 

BERNAL, blank. 

" Loyal " ? 

SIR RALPH. 

After all I have done for you ! 

BERNAL. 

Pray what have you done ? 



i84 THE ALBUM 

SIR RALPH, pulkd ap^ embttrrassed an instant, by the question ; then 
indicating, with angry fatuity, the nobleness of his appearance. 

Dressed myself — as you see ! 

BERNAL, taking him in, up and down. 

For your portrait ? 

SIR RALPH, exhibiting himself. 

As the " Patron of Art " 1 

BERNAL. 

My dear Ralph, my art must go unpatronised ! (With the 

note of raeful melancholy, but smiling.) No SOng nO SUpper 1 
SIR RALPH, outraged. 

You won't paint me ? 

BERNAU 

Wasn't I to paint you only if I saved you ? 

SIR RALPH, with a wail of despair. 

So Tm lost? 

BERNAL, seeing Lady Basset. 

Ask her ladyship ! 

Re-enter Lady Basset from the right. 

LADY BASSET, pausing at the door and glaring with majestic reproach 
and displeasure at Sir Ralph. 

I've come for you ! 



ACT THIRD 185 

SIR RALPH, in mortal angubh. 

Come for me ? 

LADY BASSET. 

I gave you three minutes. 

SIR RALPH, looking at his watch, confessing in despair his transgression. • 

And I've taken thirty ! 

BERNAL, to Lady Basset, indulgently extenuating, explaining. 

You see, there's to be no portrait ! 

SIR RALPH, eagerly, in the same way. 

I'm not to sit to him. 

LADY BASSET, staring an instant ; then formidably indicating the open door. 

Then you're to sit to me ! 

SIR RALPH, demoralised, tragic, looking blankly at the open door while she 
points the way out ; and then, with the climax of despair, appealing supremely 
to Mark Bbrnal. 

Help me ! 

BERNAL, hesitating, thinking an instant ; then indicating Grace as, after 
having wandered up the stage in impatient suspense during his dialogue 
with Sir Ralph, she now comes down again. 

Help me! 



SIR RALPH, as if with the last terrified lucidity of reflection, the sudden 
dawn of a new idea, which he leaps at, making up his mind, while his eyes 
move an instant from Grace to Bernal and while Lady Basset still stands 
in control of the open door. 

Wait for me ! 

Exit Sir Ralph to the right. 



i86 THE ALBUM 

LADY BASSET, to the others, smiling triumphantly. 

He'll not be long ! 

Exit Lady Bassbt to the right. 
BERNAL, to Grace. 

I bade you good-bye ; but, thank heaven, you were kept 
for me ! 

GRACE 

I was kept by my occupations. 

BERNAL. 

The first of your occupations now (tender, ardent) must be 
to forgive me ! 

GRACE 

For believing a story so monstrous ? 

BERNAL. 

I didn't believe it, but it puzzled me ; it puzzled me 
because I cared — I mean because I loved you ! (Then, 

as she starts at this, turning away.) I hadn't the right tO tcll yOU 

so, any more than I have it now ; and that made me 
wild, it made me mad, it made things crooked and dark 
to me. 

GRACE, very sad. 

And still they're not straight, not clear ! I've tried to 
serve you, but I haven't served you yet. 

BERNAL, passionate. 

You serve me at this moment by letting me tell you 

that I trust you ! 

GRACE 

What if you trust me to little profit ? 



ACT THIRD 187 

BERNAL. 

The " profit " is the joy of confidence ! The confidence 
was there though I was troubled ; it was there though 
I was mystified. I want no proof that you're precious, 
for the only thing I ask of you is to let me deserve 
your charity ! 

GRACE. 

You make me almost want to have failed — in order to 
have the right to listen to you. You must never be able 
to say of me that my effort was half for myself. 

BERNAL. 

Give up your "effort" — give up what exposes and 
divides us ! How can I possibly desire any boon that 
has made you cruelly suffer for me ? 

GRACE, after quick, intense reflection. 

I haven't cruelly suffered " for " you ; but (with another pause 
of hesitation) I bcUeve I could suffer with you ! 

BERNAL. 

You shan't, if you'll take me ; I declare you shall only 
enjoy ! You'll teach me a better way to live ; you'll 

teach me a finer way to work ! (Taking up his hat, which he has 

put down on coming in.) Let US go forth as wc are — together ! 

GRACE, thinking, yielding, but hesitating. 

And forego the advantage — 

BERNAL, as she pauses. 

The advantage ? 



i88 THE ALBUM 

GRACE. 
Of further communion with Sir Ralph ! 

BERNAU 

Has that communion been so sweet ? (With a decisive, com- 

prehensive motion as of final and total rupture.) Good-bye tO it ! 
GRACES with a last perfunctory scruple. 

You don't really want to know — ? 

BERNAL, energetically breaking in. 

I don't want to know anything ! (Laughing.) I revel in 
my ignorance and in the prospect of your society ! 

(Then as if to vanquish her last lingering he^tation.) It WaS not for 

you to help me^ dearest — it is for me to help you ! 

GRACE, thinking, assenting, but looking about her with a faint, vague 
sigh of regret for what she gives up. 

So fate may have decreed ! (Then as she surrenders her hand, 

surrenders herself wholly.) And I like it aS well ! 

BERN AL, with a joyous laugh, drawing, pressmg her to his bosom. 

I like it much better ! 

Re-enter Tbddy Ashdown. 
TEDDY, arrested an instant ; then as they quickly separate ; radiant 

Dear Maud has accepted me ! 

BERNAL, in the same manner. 

And Miss Jesmond has accepted me ! 

Re-enter Maud Vannbck from the left. 



ACT THIRD 189 

MAUD, after a moment's modest pause in the doorway ; demurely to Grace. 

Mr. Ashdown will take me out ! 

GRACE, smiling at her and accepting Bernal's arm as if to represent the 
immediate application of the words. 

And Mr. Bernal will take me / 

BERNAL, seebg Sir Ralph. 

Though Sir Ralph looks dangerous ! 

Re-enter Sir Ralph from the right. 
SIR RALPH, white, haggard, almost ravaged. 

I've accepted Lady Basset ! 

BERNAL, smiling, as Lady Basset, radiant, reappears. 

We all do the same ! 

Re-enter Lady Basset from the right. 

SIR RALPH, looking with concentrated and agitated significance at Lady 
Basset and speaking with intense and calculated deliberation. 

You'll do so with double relish when you see with what 
zeal she joins me — 

LADY BASSET, vague, as he invitingly pauses ; as if made uneasy by his 
look and tone. 

Joins you — ? 

SIR RALPH, encouraged and sustained by her alarm. 

In an act of enlightened justice. 

GRACE, with irrepressible joy. 

Justice ? 



I90 THE ALBUM 

LADY BASSET, growing darker. 

Sir Ralph, what madness — ? 

SIR RALPH, hopefully exalted. 

The madness, my lady, of making over to Mark the 
inheritance IVe held in trust for him ! 

LADY BASSET, aghast, astounded. 

Four thousand a year ? 

SIR RALPH. 

Four thousand a year! (ToBernal.) You would have 
had it ! 

BERNAL, amazed, bewildered. 

The whole property ? I might have had a little ! 

SIR RALPH, uplifted by the assurance of his success, while he looks at 
Lady Basset. 

You shall have all ! You have nothing of your own, 
and I have enough. 

LADY BASSET, almost shrieking in her derision and dismay. 

Enough ? 

SIR RALPH. 

My dear, in having you I 

LADY BASSET, overwhelmed, indignant, with a gesture of outraged 
retractation. 

You havetCt " me " ! (With the violent motion of clearing her path, 
throwing up the whole thing, she goes rapidly up. Then at the door to the hall, 
with concentrated repudiation.) Betrayer! 

Exit Lady Basset to the hall. 



ACT THIRD 191 

BERNAL. 
My dear Ralph, you're too splendid 1 

GRACE, to Bernal. 

Wait till you get it ! 

MAUD, on Teddy's arm ; demurely, to Sir Ralph. 

You'll never see her again ! 

SIR RALPH, relieved, restored, reassured ; measuring, satisfied. 

It's cheap !
