GUY DOMVILLE 



ACT FIRST 

The garden of an old house in the West of 
England; the portion directly behind the house, 
away from the public approach. Towards the centre 
a flat old-fashioned stone slab, on a pedestal, formed 
like a table and constituting a sun-dial. Close to 
it a garden-seat. On the right a low wooden gate, 
leading to another part of the grounds. On the left 
a high garden wall with a green door. A portion of 
the house is visible at the back, with a doorway, a 
porch and a short flight of steps. A waning June 
afternoon. Enter Frank Humber, by the wooden 
gate. Enter Fanny from the house. 

Fanny. You're wanted, sir! Excuse me, sir; I 
thought you were Mr. Domville. 

Frank. Isn't Mr. Domville in the house? 

Fanny. No indeed, sir: I came out to look for 
him. 

Frank. He's not that way: I left my horse at the 
stable, where, I may mention, I had to put him up 
myself. 

Fanny. I'm not afraid of beasts, sir, and if I had 
been there I would have taken hold of him. Peter's 
away with my mistress. 

Frank. And where has your mistress gone? 

Fanny. Over to Taunton — in the old green gig.

126 Guy Domville 

Frank. A plague on the old green gig! I've ridden 
five miles to see her. 

Fanny. You often do that, sir! 

Frank. Not half so often as I want! 

Fanny. We all know at Porches what you want, 
sir! {Sympathetically.) She'll come back to you! 

Frank. It was just in that hope I rode over! 

Fanny. (With a laugh.) Oh, I mean back from 
Taunton! 

Frank. I trust so — if the gig holds out! And who 
is it then wants Mr. Domville? 

Fanny. It is my mistress that mostly wants him, 
sir! — she sends me for him to this place and that. 
But at present he happens to have a different call. 
This visitor! 

(Enter Lord Devenish from the house.) 

Frank. Leave me with him! 

Fanny. (With a curtsey to Lord Devenish.) I'll 
try the pond — or the river, sir! (Exit by the green 
door.) 

Lord Devenish. Does she mean to drag 'em? I 
hope he ain't drowned! 

Frank. My friend Mr. Domville has the habit of 
fishing, sir. 

Lord Devenish. The most innocent of pleasures 
— yet perhaps the most absorbing! In Mr. Domville's 
apparent absence I rejoice to find myself introduced 
to one of his friends. 

Frank. May I inquire if you also enjoy that title? 

Lord Devenish. I hope to win it, sir! I've trav- 
elled for the purpose all the way from London! 
My business with Mr. Domville is urgent — so urgent 
that while impatiently waiting, just now, till he 
should be summoned, I ventured to step out of the 
house in the hope of meeting him the sooner. 

Frank. Under the impression that he lives at 
Porches? 

Lord Devenish. That impression has already been 



Act First 127 

corrected. A modest habitation in the village was 
pointed out to me on my arrival. 

Frank. Mr. Domville's humble lodging — at the 
baker's. 

Lord Devenish. I smelt the warm bread a mile 
off! I had the privilege of an interview with the 
baker's wife, and it was in consequence of the in- 
formation she gave me that I knocked without 
delay at this door. 

Frank. Mr. Domville spends most of his time 
here. 

Lord Devenish. A charming place — to spend most 
of one's time! 

Frank. That depends on what one spends it in! 

Lord Devenish. Mine must all go to business — 
business of marked importance. 

Frank. A matter, evidently, of life and death! 

Lord Devenish. You may judge, sir, that I haven't 
posted night and day for a trifle! I learned from the 
baker's wife that Mr. Domville does come home to 
bed: but the nature of my errand forbade me to 
wait till he should happen to be sleepy. I stand 
engaged, moreover, not to let Mr. Domville slip. 

Frank. I may let you know, then, that you've 
arrived in the nick of time! He goes to-morrow. 

Lord Devenish. (Startled.) Goes where? 

Frank. Into retreat, as we Catholics call it. 

Lord Devenish. (Raising his hat) The true and 
only Church! 

Frank. (Gratified.) You're one of us, sir? 

Lord Devenish. The blackest sheep in the fold! 

Frank. The fold here is very small. But we're 
protected by my Lord Edenbrook. 

Lord Devenish. He provides, I know, for your 
spiritual nourishment. 

Frank. His private chapel, his worthy chaplain, 
are precious comforts to us. 

Lord Devenish. The centre, of course, of your 



is8 Guy Domville 

little cluster of the faithful. Why then should Mr. 
Domville forsake such privileges? 

Frank. For the sake of others that are greater. To 
enter a religious house. 

Lord Devenish. As a preparation for holy orders? 

Frank. The time for his ordination has at last 
come. He starts in the morning for Bristol. 

Lord Devenish. Thank God, then, I swore at the 
postboys! He takes ship for France? 

Frank. For Douai and the good Fathers who 
brought him up, and who tried, heaven reward 
them! to do the same by me! 

Lord Devenish. The Benedictines? You were both 
at school with them? 

Frank. A part of the time together. But I'm not 
of the stuff of which churchmen are made! 

Lord Devenish. And you consider that Mr. Dom- 
ville is? 

Frank. It's not I — it's everyone. He has what they 
call the vocation. 

Lord Devenish. Then have I come too late? (Re- 
enter Fanny from the green door.) Can't you find 
him? 

Fanny. Not by the water, sir. But the dairy-maid 
has seen him: he's gone to walk with the little 
master. 

Frank. The little master's the little pupil. 

Lord Devenish. Mrs. Peverel's son? 

Frank. Her only one — poor little fatherless imp! 
Guy Domville, recommended to her by Lord Eden- 
brook's chaplain, has had for the last year the 
happiness of being his tutor. Thank you, Fanny. 
We'll wait. 

(Exit Fanny to the house.) 

Lord Devenish. Your own preference, sir, is to 
stay? 

Frank. Assuredly — when I've ridden five miles 
to take leave of him. 



Act First 129 

Lord Devenish. At so private an interview with 
so old a friend my presence will perhaps be indis- 
creet. May I therefore ask you to be so good as to 
make it clear to him that I await him impatiently 
at the inn? 

Frank. I shall be able to make it clearer if I'm 
permitted to mention your name. 

Lord Devenish. (Drawing from the breast of his 
waistcoat a letter without a seal.) My name is on 
this letter, which expresses the importance of my 
mission and which I have been requested to place 
in his hand. He will receive it, however, with 
deeper concern from yours. 

Frank. (With the letter.) He shall have it as 
soon as he returns. (Indicating the wooden gate.) 
That's the short way to the village. 

Lord Devenish. Before I go may I ask you an- 
other? Is Mrs. Peverel of the Sussex Peverels? 

Frank. Her late husband was of that famly. She's 
a niece of my Lord Edenbrook. 

Lord Devenish. Very good blood! And a widow 
of some — antiquity? 

Frank. Antiquity? Why she's just my age! 

Lord Devenish. (Laughing.) The very flower 
of youth! — And very charming? 

Frank. Judge for yourself, sir! 

(Enter Mrs. Peverel from the house. Lord 
Devenish, removing his hat, remains a 
moment meeting her eyes while she returns 
his look. Then he makes a ceremonious 
bow and goes out by the wooden gate.) 

Mrs. Peverel. (Surprised.) What does the gen- 
tleman desire? 

Frank. To have speech of our young divine. 

Mrs. Peverel. Pray, who is he? 

Frank. I believe that letter tells. 

Mrs. Peverel. (With the letter.) "For Mr. Dom- 
ville, introducing my Lord Devenish." 



130 Guy Domville 

Frank. (Surprised.) My Lord Devenish? 

Mrs. Peverel. (Wondering.) Isn't that the name 
— the name — ? 

Frank. The name of a nobleman of extraordinary 
assurance! 

Mrs. Peverel. That's just what I mean — the one 
who was said to be Mrs. Domville's great adorer. 

Frank. Do you mean the lady's lover? I never 
knew any Mrs. Domville but the mother of our 
good friend. 

Mrs. Peverel. I speak of the widow of one of his 
kinsmen — the one that was the head of the family. 

Frank. (Smiling.) He's not the head of ours! God 
bless you for such a letter! 

Mrs. Peverel. (Turning over Lord Devenish's 
letter.) It's not sealed, you see. (Absent.) What 
does he want of Mr. Domville? 

Frank. I don't mean that one — I mean yours, 
that came yesterday. You see it has brought me 
over. 

Mrs. Peverel. Didn't you come over to see your 
friend? 

Frank. You're my friend, and when I come to 
your house you're always the person I come fort 
Especially when you let me know that you desire 
it. 

Mrs. Peverel. (Surprised.) Is that what my letter 
conveyed? 

Frank. It conveyed that I might ride over if I 
liked — which comes to the same thing. And it con- 
veyed some other things. Have you already for- 
gotten? 

Mrs. Peverel. I don't remember — I'm miserably 
sad. We're losing our best company. 

Frank. Dear lady, it's you who are mine, and I 
haven't lost you yet! 

Mrs. Peverel. You haven't yet gained me, Mr. 
Humber! 



Act First 131 

Frank. What then did your letter mean? 

Mrs. Peverel. I don't know what it meant! I'll 
tell you some other time! 

Frank. Thank you for that. I assure you I look 
forward to other times. 

Mrs. Peverel. Oh, we shall have leisure! It 
stretches out like the Great Desert! The cruel loss 
will be Geordie's. He parts with his comrade — with 
his idol! 

Frank. The child loves him so? 

Mrs. Peverel. Loves him? He clings to him — he's 
spending his last hour with him! Such devotion as 
my boy has enjoyed and such perfect tenderness — 
such an influence and such an example! And now it 
all goes! 

Frank. It goes to a greater work! 

Mrs. Peverel. (Musing, with a vague shrug) 
Yes, yes — a greater work! 

Frank. He'll rise to high honours — be one of the 
Princes of the Church. 

Mrs. Peverel. I don't know if he'll be one of its 
"Princes" — but he may very well be one of its Saints. 

Frank. (Laughing.) Ah, that's more difficult! for 
that you must give up things! 

Mrs. Peverel. (With decision.) Well — he'll give 
them up! He's one of those who can! 

Frank. Dear lady, your boy loses one friend, but 
he keeps another! I don't compare myself — except 
for the interest I may take — with such a companion, 
with such a benefactor as Guy. I'm not clever, I'm 
not learned, I shall never rise to honours, much less 
to holiness! But I can stand firm — I can keep watch 
— I can take his little hand in mine. Mrs. Peverel, 
let me be something to him! 

Mrs. Peverel. You can be as good-natured as you 
like — my house is always open to you. What more 
do you want? 

Frank. You know what I want — what I've 



132 Guy Domville 

wanted these two years. I've taken you on this side 
and on that, but you always have some side that's 
turned away. Haven't I gone all round you yet? 

Mrs. Peverel. (Smiling.) You talk as if you were 
buying a horse! 

Frank. I'd buy fifty, if you'd sit behind 'em! Let 
me stand to-day on the ground we just spoke of! 
Let your affection and your anxieties be mine. Let 
your boy be my boy! 

Mrs. Peverel. (As if consentingly , resignedly.) 
Well — he has given you a bit of his heart. 

Frank. He's a fine example to his mother! 

Mrs. Peverel. Remain then in his good graces! 
They ought to be back. He'll be very tired. 

Frank. (Smiling.) With me he needn't fear that! 

Mrs. Peverel. I'm speaking of Mr. Domville. 

Frank. I'm speaking, dear lady, of myself! You 
haven't admitted me at last only to put me off once 
more? What did your good words mean if they 
didn't mean that I should at last have my answer? 

Mrs. Peverel. You shall have it tomorrow. 

Frank. (Gravely impatient.) Ah, you don't treat 
me well! 

Mrs. Peverel. (As if admitting this, conciliatory.) 
You shall have it to-night! 

Frank. Why not now? 

Mrs. Peverel. Give me this last hour! (Then in a 
totally different tone and as if forcibly to change the 
subject, while she draws from her pocket a very 
small box, from which she removes the cover.) What 
do you think of that? 

Frank. (With the box, pleased, interested.) A 
fine gem, an intaglio? 

Mrs. Peverel. A precious antique that belonged 
to my father. I made the goldsmith at Taunton 
set it as a seal. 

Frank. And you went over to get it? 

Mrs. Peverel. For a gift at parting. 



Act First 133 

Frank. (Disconcerted.) At parting? 

Mrs. Peverel. With Mr. Domville. 

Frank. (Ruefully.) Oh! (Gives her back the box 
and turns away.) Here he is to receive it! 

(Enter Guy Domville from the house.) 

Guy. We went further than we knew and Geor- 
die's a little lame. It's nothing — I think his shoe 
wasn't right and that it will pass before morning. 
But I've sent him to bed and told him I would ask 
you to go to him. 

Mrs. Peverel. (Very prompt.) I'll go to him! 

Guy. I'll wait for you here. 

(Exit Mrs. Peverel to the house.) 

Frank. You can't do that when you're waited for 
yourself. 

Guy. Waited for — by whom? 

Frank. That letter will tell you. 

Guy. (With the letter; vague.) "My Lord Dev- 
enish"? 

Frank. He's cooling his heels at the inn. 

Guy. (Reading.) "Dear and honoured kinsman: 
This is to entreat you to give such welcome as is 
fitting to our noble friend, my trusty messenger, the 
Lord Devenish, and lend a patient ear to all he 
will say to you — much better than she herself can 
— for your loving cousin and humble servant Maria 
Domville." (Vaguely recalling.) She must be the 
widow of my cousin who died ten years ago. 

Frank. And the reputed mistress of her noble 
friend? 

Guy. (Disconcerted.) His reputed mistress? 

Frank. (Laughing.) Pardon me, Guy — I forgot 
your cloth! 

Guy. I'm not of the cloth yetl 

Frank. You might be, with your black clothes 
and your shy looks: such an air of the cold college 
— almost of the cold cloister! Will you go to his 
lordship? He's counting the minutes. 



134 Guy Domville 

Guy. (Hesitating, glancing at his letter again) 
"A patient ear"? — I must take leave of Mrs. Peverel 
first. 

Frank. Can't you do that later? 

Guy. Not if my visitor's to command me and the 
coach is to start at dawn. 

Frank. Then / mustn't take your time! 

Guy. Be easy, dear Frank. We're old, old friends. 
You must let me tell you how often I shall think of 
you and how much happiness I wish you. 

Frank. Do you remember, when you say that, the 
happiness I must long for? 

Guy. I remember it. I desire it. 

Frank. You speak out of your goodness! 

Guy. Out of our long affection — yours and mine. 

Frank. I can remember as far back as your 
mother, and the wonder with which I listened when 
she told me that you were to be bred up a priest. 

Guy. God rest her pure spirit — it was an honest 
vow! The vow has been fulfilled! 

Frank. You must help me to fulfil mine — I think 
you can. 

Guy. I shall always be glad to help you. 

Frank. I mean now — on the spot — before you're 
lost to us. You go for years, I suppose; perhaps even 
forever. 

Guy. Yes; perhaps even for ever! I give up my 
life — I accept my fate. 

Frank. (Laughing.) You're not dead yet! But for 
us — it is your last hour. 

Guy. My last! My last! I must therefore do some- 
thing very good with it. How can I help you, Frank? 

Frank. By speaking for me — by telling her to 
believe in me. She thinks all the world of you. 

Guy. She's attached to our holy Church. 

Frank. That's just what I mean. Your thoughts 
are not as other men's thoughts: your words are not 
as other men's words. It's to a certain extent her 



Act First 135 

duty to act on them, so you're the man of all men 
to plead my cause. 

Guy. (After a moment.) Will you be very good 
to her? 

Frank. I give you my word before heaven. 

Guy. Some men — are not gentle. And she — she's 
all gentleness! 

Frank. Oh, I know what she is! 

Guy. Then you'll be faithful, tender, true? 

Frank. My dear man, I worship the ground she 
treads on! And I've a good estate and an ancient 
name. 

Guy. (After a moment.) I'll plead your cause. 

Frank. Now, then, is your time! 

(Re-enter Mrs. Peverel.) 

Mrs. Peverel. The child's only tired — but he's 
very wide awake. He wants to hug you again! 

Guy. I'll go and be hugged! 

Mrs. Peverel. Not yet — he'll be quieter. (To 
Humber.) You've ridden far enough to deserve 
refreshment. They've put some out in the White 
Parlour. 

Frank. I'll drink to Domville's preferment! (Exit 
to the house.) 

Guy. He worships the ground you 'tread on, and 
he swears before heaven he'll be good to you. 

Mrs. Peverel. (Smiling.) Did he ask you to tell 
me so? 

Guy. And he has a good estate and an ancient 
name. 

Mrs. Peverel. Not so ancient as yours, my friend 
— one of the two or three oldest in the kingdom! 

Guy. Oh, I'm giving up my name! I shall take 
another! 

Mrs. Peverel. You have indeed the vocation, Mr. 
Domville. 

Guy. I have the opportunity. I've lived with my 
eyes on it, and I'm not afraid. The relinquished 



136 Guy Domville 

ease — the definite duties — the service of the Church 
— the praise of God: these things seem to wait for 
me! And then there are people everywhere to help. 

Mrs. Peverel. If you help others as you've helped 
me, your comfort will indeed be great! 

Guy. I have my comfort, for under your roof I've 
found— my only way, my deepest need. IVe learned 
here what I am — IVe learned here what I'm not. 
Just now, as I went from place to place with the 
child, certain moments, certain memories came 
back to me. I took him the round of all our rambles, 
yours and mine — I talked to him prodigiously of 
his mother. 

Mrs. Peverel. / shall talk to him of his absent 
tutor. 

Guy. Talk of me sometimes with Frank Humber! 

Mrs. Peverel. {Abrupt, irrelevant, with her eyes 
on the letter that lies on the stone.) Who's my Lord 
Devenish? 

Guy. (Startled.) I ought to go and learn! 

Mrs. Peverel. Doesn't your letter tell you? 

Guy. Read it, and you'll see. 

Mrs. Peverel. I won't read it — thank you! 

Guy. He will be very good to you. 

Mrs. Peverel. Of whom are you speaking? 

Guy. Of Frank Humber. He'll help you — he'll 
guard you — he'll cherish you. Make him happy. 

Mrs. Peverel. That's easily said! 

Guy. Marry him! 

Mrs. Peverel. Why do you speak of marriage, 
Mr. Domville? 

Guy. I, the first law of whose profession, the rigid 
rule of whose life, is to abstain from it? I don't 
speak of it as a man of the world — I speak of it as 
a priest. There are cases in which our Mother- 
Church enjoins it. We must bow to our Mother- 
Church. (Exit to the house.) 



Act First 137 

Mrs. Peverel. (Alone.) To bow to our Mother- 
Church? Am I not bowing to her — down to the very 
earth? (Restless, nervous, she once more turns her 
eyes to the open letter on the table, and, taking it 
up with decision, stands reading it. Lord Devenish 
meanwhile reappears at the wooden gate and re- 
mains unperceived by her, watching her. Re-enter 
Lord Devenish.) You're impatient, my lord. 

Lord Devenish. (Smiling and indicating the 
letter.) Not more so than you, Madam! 

Mrs. Peverel. With Mr. Domville's permission. 

Lord Devenish. My license for returning is al- 
most as good — my insurmountable anxiety! That 
anxiety came into being when, in the act of retir- 
ing from this spot, I had the honour to see you face 
to face. It suggested reflections, and I may as well 
confess frankly that it forbade my going back to the 
inn. It keeps me at my post! 

Mrs. Peverel. I don't understand you, my lord. 

Lord Devenish. You probably will — when Mr. 
Domville does! 

Mrs. Peverel. I'll send him to you — and give 
orders for your lordship's entertainment! (Exit to 
the house.) 

Lord Devenish. There's no such entertainment as 
the presence of a charming woman! If he gave her 
the letter she's exactly what I seemed to guess — his 
confidant, his counsellor. In that case I smell con- 
tradiction! (Enter Guy Domville from the house.) 
But this fellow is worth a pass or two! 

Guy. I was on the point of waiting on your 
lordship. 

Lord Devenish. I've come so far to see you, sir, 
that I made no scruple of a few steps more. My 
visit has, of course, an explanation. 

Guy. I receive indeed so few — ! 

Lord Devenish. It only lies with yourself, sir, 



138 Guy Domville 

to be surrounded with the homage of multitudes! 

Guy. You're ignorant, probably, how little, my 
lord, things lie with myself! 

Lord Devenish. On the contrary, sir — it was just 
that knowledge that brought me hither in person, 
and brought me so fast. My credentials, as you've 
assured yourself, testify to the importance of my 
errand. 

Guy. Mrs. Domville does me unexpected honour. 

Lord Devenish. Not as much as you'll do me, sir, 
if you'll give me your best attention. Be seated, I 
pray you. It's my painful duty to begin with an- 
nouncing to you the death of your nearest kinsman 
— your only one, the late Mr. Domville of Gaye. 
His horse has broken his neck for him — he was 
mostly too drunk to ride! 

Guy. I could have wished him a more edifying 
end! 

Lord Devenish. You might have wished him a 
seemlier life — and a little less numerous progeny! 
He never married. 

Guy. (Surprised.) Yet he had children? 

Lord Devenish. They're not worth speaking of! 

Guy. Surely they're worth commiserating! 

Lord Devenish. For losing the estate? 

Guy. (Still more surprised.) Do they lose it? 

Lord Devenish. It's shrunken, it's burdened, the 
old domain of Gaye, but it has stood there from the 
Conquest, sir, and it has never been out of your 
family. 

Guy. But if the late Mr. Domville's children are 
my family — ? 

Lord Devenish. (Scandalised.) They — a pack of 
village bastards? 

Guy. (Bewildered.) Yet if there's no one else — ? 

Lord Devenish. If there had been no one else, 
Mr. Domville (ruefully feeling his loins), I wouldn't 



Act First 139 

have posted till I ached! You yourself, sir, are your 
family. 

Guy. (As if roused from a dream.) I? 

Lord Devenish. You're the next in succession — 
you're the master of Gaye. 

Guy. (Stupefied.) I? 

Lord Devenish. The heir of your kinsman, the 
last of your name. 

Guy. (Dazed.) To me, my lord, such things are 
fables! 

Lord Devenish. That's exactly why I came to 
announce them. You mightn't take 'em in from 
another! 

Guy. I've chosen my part, my lord. I go to-morrow 
to take it. 

Lord Devenish. The purpose of my visit, sir, is 
to protest against your going. Your duty is nearer 
at hand — it's first to the name you bear. Your life, 
my dear sir, is not your own to give up. It belongs 
to your position — to your dignity — to your race. 

Guy. (Quietly, firmly.) I was bred up, my lord, 
to be a priest. 

Lord Devenish. You were not bred up, I suppose, 
not to be a Domville! 

Guy. The very Domville that, in our branch, was 
always given to the Church! As long ago as I 
remember, the Church had accepted the gift. It's too 
late to take it back. 

Lord Devenish. Too late? Not by several hours! 
Your coldness seems to remind me that to your 
consecrated character there are images unsuitable, 
forbidden! Do me the favour, then, to suppose that 
character a moment discontinued. (Laughing.) Do 
you owe your ferocity to Mrs. Peverel? 

Guy. (Surprised, slightly resentful.) Mrs. Peverel 
has been my kindest friend — she approves for me 
of the religious life. 



140 Guy Domville 

Lord Devenish. And her way of showing her 
approval has been to hurry you off to Bristol? 

Guy. She has not "hurried" me, my lord — she 
has even, from day to day, detained me. 

Lord Devenish. (Struck, dryly.) Ah! — Thank 
heaven for that detention! 

Guy. For the sake, you know, of my pupil. 

Lord Devenish. Thank heaven for your pupil! — 
Have your pupil, and your pupil's mother, sir, 
never opened your eyes to another possible life — the 
natural, the liberal, the agreeable, the life of the 
world of men — and of women — in which your name 
gives you a place? I put you that question for Mrs. 
Domville. 

Guy. Mrs. Domville's inquiries are a wondrous 
civility to a person she has never seen. 

Lord Devenish. Let me express to him, without 
reserve, the extravagance of her wish to see him! 
When she married into your family, sir, into which 
she brought a very handsome accession, it was with 
a great zeal to serve it and to contribute, if might 
be, to its duration. Your kinsman who died last 
week succeeded to his nephew, that only son whom, 
in his early childhood, Mrs. Domville had the bit- 
terness to lose. She has been twice a widow, and she 
has from her first marriage an amiable daughter, 
a consolation imperfect indeed, however prized, for 
the great affliction of her life. 

Guy. The death of the boy you speak of? 

Lord Devenish. The heir to your name, dear 
sir, the tender hope, as it then seemed, the little 
opening flower of your race. 

Guy. When the flower was gathered the race 
was doomed! 

Lord Devenish. Doomed? Not to such easy ex- 
tinction! Don't you feel the long past in your blood, 
and the voice of the future in your ears? — You hold 
in your hand, sir, the generations to come! 



Act First 141 

Guy. (Much shaken.) What is it then, my lord — 
what is it you want to do with me? 

Lord Devenish. To carry you to-night to your 
kinswoman. She has paramount things to say to 
you. 

Guy. I ask nothing of this lady but to let me lead 
my life! 

Lord Devenish. Exactly what she wants you to 
do! She only wants to show you how and to see you 
face to face. 

Guy. I doubt if you measure, my lord, I doubt 
if Mrs. Domville measures, so large a sacrifice, to 
considerations never yet present to me — to every- 
thing I've learned to put away. 

Lord Devenish. If you've learned to put away 
your proper pride, you've learnt a very ill lesson! 

Guy. I know no pride so proper as that of the 
office I've been appointed to fill. 

Lord Devenish. The office to which you have 
been appointed is that of a gallant gentleman, and 
the place in which to fill it is the brave old house 
of your fathers! Do as they did in their day — make 
it ring with the voices of children! The more little 
Domvilles the more good Catholics! Do what you 
can for them, and you'll do quite enough for your 
Church! 

Guy. Break with all the past, and break with it 
this minute? — turn back from the threshold, take 
my hand from the plough? — The hour is too trou- 
bled, your news too strange, your summons too 
sudden! 

Lord Devenish. I reckoned on your great under- 
standing, sir, and the fine effect of your studies! 
If before our meeting, sir, I attached a price to 
your person, that price has doubled since I've had 
the honour to converse with you! Your place in 
the world was in my eye — but at present I see how 
you'd adorn it! 



142 Guy Domville 

Guy. I've no place in the world! 

Lord Devenish. I'll take leave of you on the 
spot, sir, if you'll declare to me, on your honour, 
that you're dead to the pleasures of life. I shall 
be happy to introduce you to them all! Can't you 
figure them, as a gentleman? Remember, for God's 
sake, that you are one! Stand forth like one — one 
of the first, as you may be, in England! That char- 
acter's a treasure that you can't throw away at your 
will! Your kinsman, just dead, dipped it woefully 
into the mire. Pick it up, and brush it off, and wear 
it! 

Guy. Who are you, what are you, my lord, that 
you have come here to trouble me — to tempt me? 

Lord Devenish. (Smiling) To "tempt" you? 
Thank you, sir, for that word! The world is wide — 
and youth is short — and opportunity shorter! 

Guy. Those are exactly reasons for my leaving 
your lordship this instant. 

Lord Devenish. Life is sweet, and friends are 
fond, and love — well, love is everything! (Re-enter 
Mrs. Peverel from the house. Aside.) He has it 
here under his nose! You come to rescue Mr. Dom- 
ville from my clutches? 

Mrs. Peverel. I come to beg your lordship to 
have patience with my country larder. 

Lord Devenish. If my appetite is undeniably 
great, Madam, your hospitality is evidently greater! 

Mrs. Peverel. Its very modest effort awaits you 
in the White Parlour, with Mr. Humber, whom 
you have already met, I think, eager to do you the 
honours. 

Lord Devenish. (After looking a moment from 
Mrs. Peverel to Guy.) Put your case to Mrs. 
Peverel, sir. I leave him, Madam, in your hands! 
(Exit to the house.) 

Guy. Who is he, Madam — what is he, that he 
comes here to draw me off? 



Act First 143 

Mrs. Peverel. To draw you off? 

Guy. My cousin is dead — there are no other kin 
— and I'm sole heir to the old estate, to the old 
honours, to all the duties and charges. I'm lord of 
the Manor of Gaye! 

Mrs. Peverel. (With great and joyous emotion.) 
What news, my friend — what news! It makes my 
heart beat high! 

Guy. I'm sole of all our line, I'm sole of all our 
name. 

Mrs. Peverel. It has come to you, this way, in 
an instant, sought you out and taken you by the 
hand? Then God be praised for your life — since 
he has taken to himself the others! 

Guy. And hasn't he taken mine — haven't I given 
it up to him? 

Mrs. Peverel. (Embarrassed but for an instant.) 
Given it up) — yes, partly! But a priest may inherit 
property! 

Guy. He may do good with it — yes. He may de- 
vote it to the poor — he may offer it to the Church! 

Mrs. Peverel. (Smiling.) He may even, without 
sin, keep a little of it for himself! Is the property 
great? shall you be rich? 

Guy. God forbid me riches! The domain is 
shrunken and burdened. But such as it is, what they 
want of me is to keep everything for myself. 

Mrs. Peverel. What "they" want of you? Who 
are "they," if they be all dead? 

Guy. Mrs. Domville's alive, and she has a plan. 
She clings to the name — she wants to keep it up. 
She has sent his lordship with the tidings. 

Mrs. Peverel. I could love his lordship for 
coming! 

Guy. I could hate him — for coming to-night! To- 
morrow he'd just have missed me. 

Mrs. Peverel. But sure the lawyers would have 



144 Guy Domville 

caught you. They'd easily have followed you to 
France. 

Guy. It's not the lawyers that trouble me! 

Mrs. Peverel. What is it then, Mr. Domville? 

Guy. It's the vision of such a change, the star- 
tling voice of such an injunction! That of my fore- 
fathers' name — which has lasted from century to 
century! 

Mrs. Peverel. Ah yes — the command to wear 
it — to wear it with honour and do great things for 
it! 

Guy. To preserving an old, old name — to giving 
it to others that they, in their turn, may give it! 

Mrs. Peverel. (Excitedly.) They want you to 
marry'? 

Guy. They want me to marry. 

Mrs. Peverel. (Eager.) Not to marry her? 

Guy. Her? 

Mrs. Peverel. Mrs. Domville — your cousin! 

Guy. Why, she's fifty years old! 

Mrs. Peverel. (Prompt.) I daresay she's sixty! 
Then it's their simple duty — to plead for your 
name. 

Guy. I don't care a button for my name! 

Mrs. Peverel. You do, you do — you've often told 
me so! (In an edifying tone.) Such a name as yours 
is a vast obligation! 

Guy. Too great — too great for me to carry! 

Mrs. Peverel. Why too great, when you're young, 
when you're strong, when you've a boundless life 
before you? 

Guy. The life I have before me is not that life 
— the life I have before me is simply my greater 
duty. 

Mrs. Peverel. Your greater duty is to listen to 
such a call! 

Guy. Half-an-hour ago you uttered different 
words — words that were sweet to me about the 



Act First 145 

office of which I was to enter! 

Mrs. Peverel. I uttered different words because 
I spoke of different things! — Half-an-hour ago 
everything wasn't changed! 

Guy. How can everything change when my heart 
remains the same? 

Mrs. Peverel. Are you very sure of your heart? 

Guy. No, I'm not sure! Therefore I go to-night 
to Bristol and Father Murray. I won't wait till the 
morning. 

Mrs. Peverel. (Pleading.) You'll give up — in one 
minute — so great a tradition? You'll cast away 
something precious as if it were something mean? 
Life is good, Mr. Domville: you said so and you 
know it. 

Guy. Then why have you always spoken of re- 
nouncement? 

Mrs. Peverel. (Smiling.) Because, when I did 
so, there was nothing to renounce! Now there's too 
much — ask Mrs. Domville! You'll hear from her, 
as the lawyers say, of something to your advantage. 

Guy. What advantage is like the advantage of 
keeping faith with one's vows? 

Mrs. Peverel. What vows do you speak of? 
You've taken no vows. 

Guy. Not in form perhaps — I haven't burnt my 
ships. But the irrevocable words are seated on my 
lips. What has my life been but a preparation? 

Mrs. Peverel. For this — perhaps: for just this 
hour! To choose with understanding — to act with 
knowledge — to live in the world with importance! 

Guy. (Sad and ironical.) You talk of the "world," 
my friend; but what do you know of the world? 

Mrs. Peverel. Little enough — in this country 
nook! But I should like to hear of it — from you! 

Guy. I'll tell you — when I come back — everything 
that's base and ill of it. 



146 Guy Domville 

Mrs. Peverel. (Catching at this.) Yes — when you 
come back! 

Guy. Then everything I shall say of it will show 
you that we are safer! {Then still nervously, rest- 
lessly irreconcileable.) But what will Father Mur- 
ray say to so black a desertion? 

Mrs. Peverel. He'll say you obeyed a much 
clearer call. I'll despatch him a quick messenger — 
I'll make your reasons good to him. 

Guy. If they could only be good to me! But 
they're mixed with wild thoughts and desires! 
Things I can't tell you — words I can't speak! 

Mrs. Peverel. (Soothing, encouraging.) Be your- 
self, be your generous self, and all will be straight 
and smooth to you! 

Guy. "Myself" — the self of yesterday? I seem 
suddenly to have lost it for ever! 

Mrs. Peverel. Then God be praised! (Eagerly.) 
May I tell him you'll go with him? 

Guy. (Breaking and stopping short.) Mrs. 
Peverel! — 

Mrs. Peverel. (Nervously wondering and wait- 
ing.) How can I help you? — what can I say to 
you? 

Guy. How much of your friendship may I ask — 
how much of your help may I take? 

Mrs. Peverel. You may ask anything — you may 
take all! 

Guy. (Surprised, agitated.) All? (Then as he sees 
Frank.) All that he doesn't want! 

(Re-enter Frank Humber from the house.) 

Frank. (Excited, delighted, ironical.) Here's a 
fine pother, you rascal — with your reverence going 
to Court! 

Mrs. Peverel. (Affected by the interruption, 
coldly.) You've heard it from his lordship? 

Frank. His lordship counts on a fresh start and 
a long day's run for the Domvilles! And I, my dear 



Act First 147 

lad, I pat you on the back! But you look as white 
as my Yorkshire colt. (Mystified by Guy's look 
and appealing, as if scandalised, to Mrs. Peverel.) 
You don't mean to say he won't take it? 

Mrs. Peverel. Mr. Domville starts for London 
— to-morrow very early. 

Frank. (Elated, sympathetic,) Shall I go and let 
his lordship know? 

Guy. Thank you, Frank, you can leave it to me! 

Frank. So much the better — I've something to 
say to Mrs. Peverel. 

Mrs. Peverel. (Disconcerted.) What you have to 
say had better wait, Mr. Humber. 

Frank. Oh, not again! (Confident, but sarcastic.) 
Why not send me home at once? 

Mrs. Peverel. It's much the safest place for you? 

Frank. I call on you to witness, Guy, how cruelly 
she treats me! 

Mrs. Peverel. She treats you beautifully when 
she drives four miles for you. (With her eyes on 
Guy; producing the box.) To bring you an old 
gem that I've had set as a seal. 

Frank. (Delighted.) Then it is for me? 

Mrs. Peverel. It's for you! 

Frank. (With the box.) How can I thank you 
enough? 

Mrs. Peverel. (Dryly.) Don't thank me too 
much! (To Guy.) Won't you relieve his lordship? 

Guy. (Rousing himself, with loud emphasis, from 
what he has just observed.) I'll relieve him. I'll 
accommodate him! (With a complete transforma- 
tion and a passionate flourish.) Long, long live the 
Domvilles! — Away, away for London! (Exit to the 
house.) 

Mrs. Peverel. (Surrendering herself to her joy.) 
He's free — he's free! 

Frank. (Disconcerted, detached.) "Free"? Oh, I 
see. Well, so am I, you know; and there's other 



148 Guy Domville 

news in the air; the good news you promised, an 
hour ago, on this spot, to give me in your gracious 
answer. 

Mrs. Peverel. I can't give it now — it's impossible; 
please don't ask me. 

Frank. (Dismayed.) Not "ask" you when I've 
been counting the minutes — not "ask" you when 
you've given me your word? 

Mrs. Peverel. I've given you no word! — I be- 
seech you to leave me. 

Frank. (Bewildered, astounded.) Then my pa- 
tience that you were to reward, and this present 
that you've just pressed on me — ? 

Mrs. Peverel. (Impatient, brusque, eager only to 
get rid of him.) I'm sorry — but your patience is 
wasted. I'm sorry — but the present is nothing. — 
It's a gift at parting. 

Frank. (Horrified.) You mean you refuse me? 

Mrs. Peverel. Utterly, Mr. Humber! And don't 
return to the question again! 

Frank. (Angry.) That's the sweet answer you've 
kept me waiting for? 

Mrs. Peverel. I couldn't give it before. But it's 
positive now! 

Frank. (Staring.) What's the riddle of "now"? 

Mrs. Peverel. It's not a riddle — but it's a dif- 
ferent matter. (Summarily.) Good-bye! 

Frank. Where on earth's the difference? (Then 
divining; overwhelmed.) By all that's monstrous — 
you love him! 

Mrs. Peverel. (Vehemently brushing away the 
charge, waving away his presence.) Don't speak to 
me — don't look at me — only leave me! (Almost 
imperiously.) Good-bye! 

Frank. (Pulling himself up short, making a 
violent effort.) Good-bye! 

(Re-enter Lord Devenish from the house. 
Exit Frank by the wooden gate.) 



Act First 149 

Lord Devenish. (Sarcastic.) I'm sorry you're 
losing your friend! 

Mrs. Peverel. (Who has not seen him; startled, 
confused.) Mr. Humber? 

Lord Devenish. (Amused.) Mr. Humber as 
well? You'll be lonely! 

Mrs. Peverel. (Mystified by his manner, resent- 
ing his familiarity.) My lord — ! 

Lord Devenish. It's Mr. Domville's last minute, 
and I'm not sure you'll see him henceforth. We've 
particular need of him, in another place,* to lead 
a young lady to the altar: Mrs. Domville's daughter 
by her first marriage, the amiable and virtuous 
Miss Brasier; a bride in a thousand — a Catholic, 
a beauty, and a fortune. (Seeing Domville.) Long, 
long live the Domvilles! 

(Re-enter Domville from the house.) 

Guy. I leave you to your happiness. 

Lord Devenish. You couldn't leave a lady at a 
properer moment. — It's time we should leave her. 
Come, come! 

Guy. Long, long live the Domvilles! 
Passage between Guy and Mrs. Peverel. 
Exit Guy and Lord Devenish. Mrs. 
Peverel alone. 

* The Huntington Library prompt-book contains an in- 
serted speech here for Mrs. Peverel. She echoes: "Particular 
need!" 



ACT SECOND 

Mrs. Domville's villa at Richmond. Mrs. Dom- 
ville and George Round discovered. 

Round. The reason of my "wicked return," 
ma'am, is simply the respect I owe you, and the 
respect I owe to my cousin, your too amiable 
daughter. 

Mrs. Domville. Have you forgotten that I in- 
formed you six months ago how you could best 
express that respect? 

Round. By keeping out of your sight — by per- 
mitting you to forget my existence and encouraging 
you to hope I had forgotten yours? I obeyed your 
command, ma'am; I immediately joined my ship. 
But my ship came back last week. 

Mrs. Domville. It didn't come back to Rich- 
mond, I suppose. This house is not your portl 

Round. I think, indeed, rather, it's a rough and 
unfriendly coast! 

Mrs. Domville. Take care, then, what befalls 
you in attempting to land. 

Round. What worse can befall me than what 
befell me six months ago? The life was knocked 
out of me then, and if I meet your eyes once more 
it's simply that the mere wreck of my old presump- 
tion has been washed ashore at your feet. 

Mrs. Domville. I'll warrant you a wreck that will 
take some time to sink — though indeed you do 
seem to have parted, in the tempest, with your 
uniform. 

150 



Act Second 151 

Round. On calculation, ma'am. As you appear to 
despise my profession, or at least my want of ad- 
vancement in it, I thought it good taste not to fly 
my poor colours. 

Mrs. Domville. The taste of your calculations is 
better than that of your tailor! 

Round. A man's tailor doesn't matter, perhaps, 
when he hasn't come to conquer. I am no longer 
a suitor for your daughter's hand. But I have a 
right to remind you — and this, ma'am, has been my 
errand — that I never promised to forget the tie of 
blood, the fine freedom of kinship. 

Mrs. Domville. The fine freedom of exaggera- 
tion! You blow the trumpet too loud over the 
ridiculous honour of having been poor Mr. Brasier's 
nephew. 

Round. Why is it more ridiculous for me to have 
been his nephew than for her to have been his 
daughter? 

Mrs. Domville. (After a moment) It ain't! 

Round. I've come to tell you that I engage to 
make the best of your conditions. 

Mrs. Domville. "Conditions," my dear creature? 
We offered you none whatever. You were con- 
demned without appeal. 

Round. Say then that I accept even that. A man 
is suffered to see his family before he's hanged! 

Mrs. Domville. That plea doesn't hold, sir, for 
my daughter has ceased to belong to your family! 

Round. (Blank) Pray, then, to what family does 
she belong? 

Mrs. Domville. To mine. 

Round. Yours? 

Mrs. Domville. The ancient house of Domville 
— of whose history, and whose fidelity to the old 
persuasion, you needn't affect a barbarous igno- 
rance. My daughter's about to enter it, as her 



152 Guy Domville 

mother — less worthy! — did ten years ago. She's to 
marry Mr. Domville of Gaye. 

Round. Almighty Powers! 

Mrs. Domville. Kinsman for kinsman, he's a 
much finer figure — 

Round. Than a paltry lieutenant in the King's 
Navy? For you, I can understand it. But for her? — 
has submission been so easy? 

Mrs. Domville. The poor child has submitted to 
him! She's in love, with the most brilliant of men 
— the talk of the town, the wonder of the day! She's 
as gay as a lark and as proud as a queen. 

Round. I shall believe that when I have it from 
her! 

{Enter Lord Devenish.) 

Lord Devenish. By all that's undesired, sir — You! 

Round. With her hand so splendidly bestowed, 
at any rate, there can be no longer any hindrance 
to my seeing her. 

Lord Devenish. Surely in so changed a case, dear 
sir, there can no longer be any reason for it! 

Round. You talk of reasons, my lord, only to 
remind me that I've been long in discovering that 
of the authority you appear to enjoy in the private 
concerns of this house! 

Mrs. Domville. Everyone knows his dear lord- 
ship is our oldest friend — and our most affable! 

Round. His affability I'm scarce in a position to 
enjoy. I'm willing however to beg that you appeal 
to it to grant me permission to take leave of Miss 
Brasier face to face. 

Lord Devenish. Egad, sir, if my voice on that 
matter were sought, I wouldn't give you even a 
minute to take leave of Mrs. Domville! 

Mrs. Domville. (Gracious.) After the important 
event, you can come as often as you like! 

Round. The important event takes place — ? 

Mrs. Domville. (After a moment's hesitation.) 



Act Second 153 

We had given it out for Saturday; but we antici- 
pate. 

Lord Devenish. (Emphatically.) We anticipate. 
The wedding's to-night. 

Round. (Aghast.) To-night? 

Lord Devenish. And my chaplain ties the knot! 

Round. (After an instant, concentrated.) Out 
on your knot! Curse your chaplain! (Exit.) 

Lord Devenish. Curse the beggar's intrusion! Is 
everything quite in hand? 

Mrs. Domville. What does it matter if she 
doesn't see him? 

Lord Devenish. Who can say what Mary sees? 
But everything's quite in hand! 

Mrs. Domville. The wedding-gown hasn't come 
home! 

Lord Devenish. The bride's? It will come! Yours, 
dear Madam, is at any rate in the house! 

Mrs. Domville. You don't remind me, I suppose, 
that I've two old ones on the shelf. The third takes 
longer to make! 

Lord Devenish. Do you presume to convey to me 
that you cry off our bargain? 

Mrs. Domville. You talk as if we were a pair of 
hucksters in the market! 

Lord Devenish. Fie on the comparison! Sover- 
eign, treaty-making powers! Need I remind you of 
the terms of our treaty? The day after your daugh- 
ter, pursuant to my explicit undertaking, becomes 
Mrs. Domville of Gaye, Mrs. Domville of Rich- 
mond, to crown the happy enterprise, becomes 
Viscountess Devenish. 

Mrs. Domville. You make a great flourish of it, 
but you've your engagement still to perform! 

Lord Devenish. Ain't I performing, Madam, 
every hour? Didn't I perform, just now, to that 
rascal sailor? 

Mrs. Domville. That rascal sailor has given me 



154 Guy Domville 

the fidgets! (As he goes up.) What are you going 
to do? 

Lord Devenish. To say a word to Mary. 

Mrs. Domville. And what is that word to be? 

Lord Devenish. Not, Madam, what I understand 
you fear: the voice of nature — in a tell-tale sigh. I 
stifle the voice of nature — for you! 

Mrs. Domville. Not for me. For her; and as a 
penance for all your falsity! 

Lord Devenish. That I was ever false, Madam, 
was a pleasant fable of your own — to accompany 
the stern moral of your second marriage. 

Mrs. Domville. I would have married you out 
of hand when my compunction was fresh; but by 
the time I was free — 

Lord Devenish. It had lost its early bloom? Fie 
upon compunction! Marry me for bravery! And 
suffer me to proceed. I must satisfy myself again — 

Mrs. Domville. That he has really brought her 
round? Pray if he sensibly hadn't, how could he 
be so at ease? 

Lord Devenish. (Laughing.) He's mighty fond 
of "ease"! The fellow's a born man of pleasure. 

Mrs. Domville. It's not all such gentry that 
confer as much of it as they take! 

Lord Devenish. He only desires to be agreeable 
to you, Madam. 

Mrs. Domville. He succeeded from the moment 
he looked at me. 

Lord Devenish. That's sufficiently denoted every 
time you look at him! (Bantering.) I don't mean 
to hint that poor Mary has her mother's inclina- 
tion — ! 

Mrs. Domville. Her mother, my lord, if she 
were asked, would marry the dear creature on the 
spot. As it is, she can only bustle about to adorn 
a younger bride! 



Act Second 155 

Lord Devenish. You'll go for the gown yourself? 

Mrs. Domville. In the biggest coach in my 
stables! I want to make everything sure! 

Lord Devenish. Everything is sure! (Seeing Guy.) 
And surest of all, Mr. Domville! It's a gage of his 
trust to look at him! 

(Enter Guy Domville.) 

Guy. I've been at your lodgings, my lord, to pay 
you my punctual duty; feeling that I owed you on 
so great a day an early visit and a close embrace. 

Lord Devenish. It has been to render you a like 
attention that I have just presented myself here. 

Mrs. Domville. I admire the way you quit your 
beds to do each other honour; above all when I 
think of the hour, last night, at which you must 
have got into them! 

Guy. It was an hour, Madam, I admit, that left 
us no choice of conclusions. The bright star that 
commands my attendance had long since sunk to 
obscurity; that luminary, indeed, to find a single 
fault with it, shines all too fitfully and sets all too 
soon! When Miss Brasier vanished we went for 
comfort to my Lady Mohun — but her ladyship's 
comfort proved singularly cold. — She engaged us 
deeply at cards. 

Mrs. Domville. Surely there's a fine warmth in 
cards! 

Guy. Only in the warm side of them! I lost, on 
the spot, to her ladyship almost the clothes that 
covered me! 

Lord Devenish. Guy always loses to the ladies! 

Guy. I oughtn't in modesty, I suppose, to lose 
my garments! But it's done advisedly, my lord, since 
by the common saying, that kind of ill-fortune 
makes another kind of good. 

Lord Devenish. Good fortune in love. Hark to 
the fellow! 

Guy. Perhaps on your example I ought to aim at 



156 Guy Domville 

both kinds; but what's a man to do at ombre when 
a lady corrects the luck? 

Lord Devenish. This lady would say you're to 
take no notice! 

Mrs. Domville. What on earth does his lordship 
mean? 

Guy. I won't pretend not to know! I think I 
always know, now, what his lordship means. 

Mrs. Domville. Sometimes it's a doubtful safety. 

Guy. (Laughing.) Oh, I've had a lifetime of 
safety, Madam! 

Lord Devenish. (Laughing.) The wretch quite 
dotes on his danger! 

Mrs. Domville. It's such a dear good wretch — it 
needn't fear communications! 

Guy. I don't know how good it is, cousin, but 
I'm learning every day how ignorant. 

Mrs. Domville. Your ignorance, love, was a 
mighty pretty thing! 

Guy. It goes down like an ebbing tide! I pick up 
fresh feelings as you gather pink shells; and when 
I hold these shells to my ear I find in each the 
mysterious murmur of the world! 

Mrs. Domville. You've a trick of fine speeches 
that make us women refuse you nothing. 

Guy. You women, Madam, are even kinder than 
I always supposed you. You gave me confidence, 
you know, and upon my soul, I delight in confi- 
dence. I don't know how much I inspire, but I 
revel in all I feel. On such a day as this, it's uni- 
versal. It doesn't stop even at my tailor! 

Lord Devenish. You may trust your tailor when 
he's my tailor! 

Guy. Egad, my lord, you've ordered my very 
garters! 

Lord Devenish. With an eye to your interesting 
air! We shall see you in white and gold. 

Mrs. Domville. You can see he likes a fine coat! 



Act Second 157 

Guy. I think, Madam, I like a fine anything. I 
can carry, at any rate, what you put on my back 
— and I think I can carry my happiness! Let it 
keep coming — and let me keep trying it! As I said 
to Mary anon, I enjoy my very gratitude. I meant, 
Madam, to you. 

Mrs. Domville. I hope you dc»n't always talk to 
her of me! 

Guy. When I want to please her most of all. 

Lord Devenish. Didn't I promise you'd fall into 
the way of it? Didn't I tell you at Porches that you 
didn't do justice to your parts? 

Guy. You told me at Porches some truths, my 
lord; and as regards the aptitudes you're so good 
as to praise, I'm almost frightened — 

Lord Devenish. 1 ,_ ,, x „ . , ^ ,. 

Mrs. Domville.} (TogBther.) Frightened? 

Guy. At the way your prophecy's fulfilled. You 
told me I should find knowledge sweet — and life 
sweeter — 

Lord Devenish. And love sweetest of all. 

Guy. I had a shrewd notion of that! 

Lord Devenish. The rascal had tried his hand! 

Mrs. Domville. Of course he had turned heads 
ere now. 

Lord Devenish. He sees how he has turned all 
ours! 

Guy. It was not to turn heads I came, Madam, 
but to do my duty to my line. 

Mrs. Domville. And to help me, dear Guy, to 
do mine. 

Guy. I think, if I may say so, that you make too 
much of yours. 

Mrs. Domville. (Grave, sincere.) You were not 
at Mr. Domville's deathbed. 

Lord Devenish. (As if with the privilege of hav- 
ing assisted at a most edifying scene.) I was, my 
dear Guy! 



158 Guy Domville 

Mrs. Domville. And you never knew my boy. 

Lord Devenish. You're taking the boy's place, 
you know. 

Guy. Peace then to these guardian spirits. 

Lord Devenish. Precisely. And before we sacrifice 
to them — 

Mrs. Domville. I must put my hand on the 
bride's petticoat. (To Guy.) Did she go to her 
room? 

Guy. My only complaint of her is that she's there 
too much. 

Mrs. Domville. I'll send her back to you. 

Lord Devenish. I'll instruct him that he's to keep 
her. 

Mrs. Domville (To Guy, significant.) Till her 
mother takes her. (To Lord Devenish.) Make sure 
of Father White. (Exit.) 

Lord Devenish. She'd like to have it over this 
minute! 

Guy. What in the world is she afraid of? — 

Lord Devenish. Of your other love, my lad; your 
first! 

Guy. (Blank.) My first? 

Lord Devenish. I don't mean Mrs. Peverel! 

Guy. (Very grave.) You couldn't, my lord — in 
decency. 

Lord Devenish. Decency — bless us — looks quite 
another way; decency points to our Mother- 
Church! Mrs. Domville is jealous of that high mis- 
tress. 

Guy. I don't know what I could do, that I 
haven't done, to set such jealousy at rest. There's 
scarcely a rule I haven't utterly abjured — there's 
scarcely a trust I haven't rigidly betrayed — there's 
scarcely a vow I haven't scrupulously broken! What 
more can a man do for conscience? 

Lord Devenish. What a man does for conscience, 
Guy, comes back to him for joy! 



Act Second 159 

Guy. Is that why you're so happy? 

Lord Devenish. My happiness is the happiness of 
others. 

Guy. Mine then ought to content you! Never 
once have I looked behind. I've taken what you've 
given me — I've gone where you led me — I've done 
what you've told me. 

Lord Devenish. You've done it monstrous well! 

Guy. And no one is the worse for me? 

Lord Devenish. As a man of the world that's the 
only spot on your glory! 

Guy. I must be sure that everyone is the better 
for me, for that makes me as right as the proof of 
a sum! 

Lord Devenish. (Smiling.) You'll be precious 
sure to-morrow! 

Guy. Then let to-morrow come, and many many 
to-morrows! 

Lord Devenish. Egad, we're catching up with 
them! I shall find Father White at his devotions. 

Guy. Then let him leave his devotions! Remind 
him that I've left mine! 

Lord Devenish. (Attenuating.) It's not after all 
to call him to cards! When Miss Brasier comes to 
you, be so good as to engage her closely. 

Guy. (Surprised.) Will she grudge me her com- 
pany? 

Lord Devenish. Only from agitation. Dispel her 
agitation! (Exit Lord Devenish.) 

Guy. Dispel her agitation? (Thinking, with emo- 
tion?) Face to face with my fortune I feel much 
more my own. Truly I've travelled far from all that 
might have been, and to say the words I must say, 
I must forget the words I didn't! (Re-enter George 
Round. Startled.) Pardon my inattention, sir, I 
didn't hear you announced. 

Round. I came, sir, to deliver this packet to Miss 
Brasier. 



160 Guy Domville 

Guy. Oh, another wedding-gift? 

Round. Another wedding-gift. 

Guy. From the toyman? A pretty bauble? 

Round. A gold ring, sir — with a pearl. 

Guy. (Laughing.) Only one? Pearls should come 
in dozens! But if you'll leave your packet with me, 
I'll take care Miss Brasier receives it. 

Round. My errand, sir — my errand — 

Guy. (As he stands embarrassed.) Was to place 
it in Miss Brasier's hand? 

Round. To make sure it reaches her straight. 

Guy. It shall reach her on this spot. She's coming 
to me. (Then smiling as Round starts slightly.) 
Quite lawfully, sir! I'm the bridegroom. 

Round. (After another hesitation.) Then you can 
give it. 

Guy. Is there anything to say with it? 

Round. Only that I'll come back to see if it 
pleases. (Exit.) 

Guy. To see if it pleases? For a tradesman, the 
fellow's blunt! (Enter Mary Brasier.) You've just 
missed the toyman. He brought you a ring — with a 
pearl. (Then as she appears blank and startled.) 
Won't you look at it? 

Mary. Give it to me. 

Guy. From whom does it come? 

Mary. (With the box, in suppressed agitation.) 
From no one. Where is the person who brought it? 

Guy. He'll barely have reached the gate. Shall I 
call him? 

Mary. (Uneasy, prompt.) No, no. 

Guy. He's coming back to see if it pleases. 

Mary. (Troubled, but turning the matter off.) 
It serves its purpose. 

Guy. (Laughing.) Why, you've not even tried it! 

Mary. It's a trifle — it's nothing! My mother told 
me to come to you. 

Guy. (Smiling.) Your mother doesn't trust me! 



Act Second 161 

Mary. I think she's wrong! 

Guy. Do you, Mary? Your trust will be enough 
for me. 

Mary. You're extraordinarily good to me. 

Guy. How can I be good enough, when I think of 
all you're giving me? 

Mary. (With feeling) You ought to have more 
— than / can ever give! 

Guy. More than beauty? More than virtue? More 
than fortune? More than your rising before me and 
letting me look into your eyes? I came here stam- 
mering and stumbling; but when I saw you it was 
as if I had caught the tune of my song! 

Mary. Everything had been thoroughly arranged 
for you. 

Guy. As things are arranged in the fairytales — 
only, you know, vastly better! The enchanted castle 
and the lovely princess, but never a giant nor a 
dragon. 

Mary. (Grave.) The lovely princess seemed to 
expect the adventurous prince? 

Guy. With all the charity in life! It was as if she 
too had been touched by the wizard. 

Mary. She had been touched by the wizard! 

Guy. (With tender significance.) The wizard 
whose name — ? 

Mary. (Prompt.) We mustn't speak it! 

Guy. Because they never do, in fairytales, and 
our romance must conform to the rules. May our 
rules all be as easy! You leave me again? — You 
won't stay? 

Mary. Yes, if I may make a condition. That of 
your telling me who brought the ring. 

Guy. (As if he had quite forgotten the incident.) 
The ring? — from the toyman? Why, a young man 
with a brown face. 

Mary. What sort of a manner? 

Guy. No manner at all! You know him? 



162 Guy Domville 

Mary. (Embarrassed) I had better speak to him. 

Guy. You easily can — he's coming back. 

Mary. But when, did he say? 

(Re-enter George Round.) 

Guy. Here he is! 

Mary. (Greatly discomposed, but dissimulating; 
to Guy.) Will you allow me five minutes with this 
gentleman? 

Guy. (Surprised) This gentleman? 

Round. George Porter Round, at your particular 
service, sir. 

Mary. I've something important to say to him. 

Guy. (Vague) Alone? 

Mary. (Finding a pretext) It's about you! And 
the ring. 

Guy. (Amused) Is it my finger it's to fit? Talk it 
over, then and send it back if it's not my quality! 
(Exit) 

Mary. (With emotion) You've come back! 

Round. I sent you back your early pledge as a 
sign. 

Mary. I have it. I must give you back yours — 
that you so trustingly changed for it. 

Round. Then the hideous story's true — and that's 
Mr. Domville? 

Mary. You know then — you've been told? 

Round. I was here an hour ago — straight from 
my ship. 

Mary. You saw my mother? 

Round. And your mother's — (Catching himself 
up) The Lord Devenish. 

Mary. They consented to your return? 

Round. They opposed it — with all disparage- 
ment. But I've come back in spite of everything — 
for one glimpse of you! 

Mary. They've hurried this business from the 
fear of you. 



Act Second 163 

Round. Yet they must have little to fear of you — 
from your conduct! 

Mary. Forgive me a little — you don't know! 

Round. It's / who do know, Madam — and I think 
it's you who don't. They drove me off, and I went — 
in the state you may think. Then I got back my 
reason, and it came to me that I wanted you to 
know — to know that / know, and something, on my 
soul, of what I feel! I went to the goldsmith's in the 
town, and wrenching off that little ring of yours 
that I've worn so long, made him clap it into a new 
case. I thought some accident might protect me — 
that I might pass it in to you as coming from a shop. 
As fortune does sometimes favour the desperate, I 
succeeded. The coast was clear and I found myself 
face to face with him! 

Mary. But this second time? 

Round. The porter demurred, but passed me — 
for I asked for Mr. Domville. Mr. Domville had 
done me the honour — he still does it, happily — to 
mistake me for a peddler! But he had taken charge 
of my token. 

Mary. The token of your inevitable scorn! 

Round. When we parted, I could never have 
believed it! 

Mary. We submitted, didn't we? — We consented 
to wait. 

Round. In consenting I cursed your fortune, 
which made impatience look mercenary. If you 
had been poor, I would have consented to nothing! 

Mary. My fortune is still the same. But some 
other things are different. The appeal to me pressed 
hard. And on my life it presses! 

Round. Do you mean he makes such pretty love? 

Mary. I'm speaking of my Lord Devenish. He's 
the oldest friend we have — he has ever studied to 
please me. 



164 Guy Domville 

Round. I think I've studied harder! I don't know 
what poison has worked in you, but I can't look on 
you again without feeling that you're the thing in 
the world I most desire! By the blessing of heaven 
we're alone an instant, and all my life is yours! 
Break with this monstrous betrayal, and commit 
yourself to my guard. Escape while we can escape! I 
came by the river, and my boat's at the garden- 
foot.* 

Mary. In a minute he'd miss me — he'd intercept 
us; a public dispute? Not that. (Then in deep dis- 
tress.) And there are contentions too ugly! 

Round. But your mother's not here. 

Mary. It would reach her. She's only at the milli- 
ner's. 

Round. And your mother's friend? 

Mary. His lordship? He's mustering the com- 
pany. 

Round. Then deal with this gentleman as we can. 
Overreach him! 

Mary. (Vague.) Deceive him? 

Round. He is deceived — make it better. Break it 
to him that I'm your cousin and that your mother 
has put an affront on me. Bring us acquainted, and, 
egad, we'll drink together! 

Mary. (Blank.) Drink? 

Round. (Going up to table.) Permit me to prove 
the liquor. (Pours out a glass and drinks.) Faith, 
it'll do. I can carry more than he. 

Mary. (Blank.) But what do you purpose? 

Round. To draw him on to it, and lay him on the 
floor. 

* The drinking scene which ensues here was deleted by 
Henry James from the play after the first performance. The 
reader desiring to obtain an idea of the emended version 
must skip from Round's speech here to page 171 where, at 
the point indicated below, the play continued with Round 
still speaking: "It's me, love, you'll marry to-night!" 



Act Second 165 

(Re-enter Guy.) 

Mary. Hush! 

Guy. (Surprised and amused before Round has 
time to set down his glass.) Ah, the wine-cup al- 
ready flows. 

Round. For a very thirsty messenger! 

Guy. (Smiling and addressing Mary.) The mes- 
senger's perquisite? Then you've settled the great 
question? 

Round. We've agreed on what's to be done. Shall 
I disclose it, Madam? 

Mary. Disclose it. 

(Exit Mary upstairs.) 

Round. (Promptly moving back to table.) I was 
faintish a moment since — I've had a long walk in 
the sun. 

Guy. Then help yourself, man. (Then as Round 
appears shy about handling the wine.) You'd rather 
I should help you? 

Round. (While Guy pours it for him) You're 
most obliging, but I'd fain take it with you, sir. 

Guy. (Surprised.) "With" me? (Laughing. Ac- 
commodating.) It's the wedding feast begun! 

Round. (With his full glass.) For the poor folk 
that are not bidden! 

Guy. None shall be poor to-day! You're drinking 
a royal wine. 

Round. I shall feel more worthy of it if I share 
it with you. 

Guy. (More surprised, but still amused; humour- 
ing him.) To the complete restoration of your com- 
fort! 

Round. (As if still unwell.) To the speedy estab- 
lishment of yours! (Waits for Guy to drink; then 
on Guy's smiling and waiting, drains his glass.) I 
think another would right me! 

Guy. (Offering his own untouched glass.) Then 
take this! 



166 Guy Domville 

Round. (Reluctant.) Yours? — You take it! (Guy 
drinks and fills again for Round, and then again, 
on Round insisting, for himself; and, glass in hand, 
they look at each other, till Round breaks out sud- 
denly as if the wine has begun to go to his head.) 
I ain't the toyman! 

Guy. (Amazed.) For whom I mistook you? 

Round. (Trying it on further.) No, I ain't a ped- 
dler! (Familiar, sociable.) Ton my soul I ain't a 
peddler. 

Guy. (Blank, but still amused.) Then who the 
devil are you? 

Round. George Porter Round — lieutenant in the 
King's Navy! Near relation — in fact poor relation! 
— to that virtuous lady! 

Guy. (So mystified that he doesn't believe it.) 
Who yet didn't introduce you — to the man she's 
about to marry? 

Round. Her mother's liquor, you see, has done 
that. 

Guy. (Still sceptical and increasingly astonished.) 
It shouldn't be left to the liquor, sir — and to the 
accident of a glass too much! 

Round. Whose is the glass too much? Not yours, 
sir — no glass at all! Not mine, sir — glass too little! 
Leave, on the contrary, everything to the liquor! 
(With the appearance of growing more fuddled.) 
The liquor good enough for anything. The liquor 
as good as the young lady and much better than the 
old! 

Guy. (As if the incident is beginning to strike 
him as more serious.) Pray in what relation do you 
stand — ? 

Round. Relation of worm in the dust! I mean to 
the old one! 

Guy. (With a nervous laugh.) I mean to the 
young one! 

Round. Relation of first cousin — nephew of poor 



Act Second 167 

Mr. Brasier. Remember poor Mr. Brasier? 

Guy. (After a moment, but still smiling.) I nei- 
ther remember Mr. Brasier, sir, nor quite under- 
stand Mr. Brasier's nephew! 

Round. Take me down that and you will! (Then 
as Guy, with growing bewilderment and still glass 
in hand, hesitates to drink.) Won't drink, either, 
with a poor relation? 

Guy. (As if this note touches him.) I will indeed, 
if it will give you pleasure. (Drains his glass.) 

Round. Nothing will give me so much! — Fill it 
again! 

Guy. (Again nervously laughing.) I'm afraid I 
haven't quite your head! 

Round. (Imitating complete intoxication.) I've 
no head — worm in the dust! Is a man of your rank 
afraid? 

Guy. Not of you, sir! 

Round. Then fill it again. (Insistent, persuasive.) 
You should be free on your wedding day. 

Guy. (After a moment.) I'll be free! (Drains 
another glass.) 

Round. (Confidentially.) The old lady loves me 
— not a bit! That's why the young lady — never 
mentions me at all! Quite ashamed of me too! — 
Keep it up! 

Guy. (After he has courteously complied by 
drinking a little.) I should have been glad to hear 
of you sooner. 

Round. Never too late to mend! But she has a 
feeling heart; bless it, I say. 

Guy. Miss Brasier? Bless it by all means. 

Round. I thank you for that, you know. I par- 
ticularly thank you. 

Guy. Why the devil so particularly? 

Round. Oh, you'll see, sir, if you ain't proud. 
(Motioning him to keep it up.) Come, don't be 
proud. You are when you don't meet me. (Going 



168 Guy Domville 

up to table for another decanter.) 

Guy. What trap is he baiting? I'll be caught. 

Round. (Foolishly ingratiating.) Meet me once 
in your life! # 

Guy. (After a moment, with his suspicion of 
Round's design now fairly kindled.) I'll meet you! 
I know who you are, sir. 

* The text of Guy Domville reveals clearly, as indicated 
above, that Henry James expunged the drinking scene from 
the play after the ill-fated first night. But a scrap of dialogue 
found among his papers shows that he would have liked to 
retain at least part of the scene, emending it only to render 
it more plausible. The dialogue was intended to be inserted 
as follows, after Round says "Meet me once in your life!" 

Guy. (As before.) I'll meet you! 

(Re-enter Mary.) 
I was about to meet him, Madam. 

Mary. (Troubled.) I came back to save you — 

Round. (Assured, disappointed.) Save him from what? He 
ain't proud! 

Guy. (To Mary.) He has cured me, I think, of pride! 

Mary. May I speak to him again? 

Guy. Is it very necessary? 

Mary. It's a word or two more — I must say it. 

Guy. You may say it on a condition: that he give me his 
hand. Will you give it to me, sir? 

Mary. (As Round hangs back.) Won't you give him your 
hand? Do it for me! 

Guy. (Checking her; very gravely.) Enough, Madam. I'm 
answered. 

Mary. (Uneasy, unhappy.) You should be answered better! 

Guy. (At the door.) It will serve! 
(Exit Guy.) 

Round. (Impatient, semi-reproachful.) In a moment I 
should have had him; he thinks I'm tipsy — he was coming 
on! 

Mary. He was not coming on — and I couldn't allow it. He 
saw you were acting — he knows we have a secret! 

Round. (Astounded.) Then why does he leave us with it? 

Mary. Because he thinks I've taken part — ! It's a crime to 
practise on him: he's too good! 

At this point James intended the play to proceed, as in 
the case of the previous deletion, from the speech on page 
171 "It's me, love, you'll marry to-night!" 



Act Second 169 

Round. (Coming down with decanter and filling 
for Guy who with a changed manner, frankly wel- 
comes it.) I've filled to your wedding day. 

Guy. You've filled, my dear fellow, but I'll be 
hanged if you've drunk! — Let me set you the exam- 
ple! (Drinks deep.) 

Round. (Who still doesn't drink.) What do you 
think of the wine? 

Guy. No judgment till the fifth glass! — Left 
your ship to come and see us? 

Round. I left it last week. We had been three 
months out. 

Guy. Three months out (vaguely computing) is 
just what I've been out! Devil of a time to be at the 
mercy of the waves! 

Round. (Laughing.) That's the opinion of a 
judge who has not been much at sea! 

Guy. Why, I'm at sea this blessed moment — 
never more at sea in all my life! A pack of things 
may happen in the course of three months — you 
may make a devil of a run. I've made a devil of a 
run — been off and round the world! Ever been 
round the world, in a cockle-shell like mine? (Then 
laughing as Round laughs.) I've trusted my life to 
a craft — as odd as any afloat. I think it's beginning 
to blow — do you suppose my boat'll hold? I put 
out, like you, this summer — but I haven't come into 
port. 

Round. (Hilarious.) If you haven't come into 
port, I'll be bound you've come into burgundy. 
Take care how you sail your ship! 

Guy. Got my orders, you know, for a voyage — a 
voyage of — What-do-you-call-it? You know what I 
mean to convey — 'spedishun o' 'scovery! 

Round. (Looking round the place.) Blest if you 
haven't made, then, a monstrous fine coast! 

Guy. Mons'ous fine coast, Mons'ous fine house. 



170 Guy Domville 

Mons'ous fine wine. Mons'ous fine women. 'Spedi- 
shun o' 'scovery! 

Round. (Allowing himself to become soberer as 
Guy appears more tipsy.) I, on my side, have dis- 
covered a monstrous fine gentleman in monstrous 
fine clothes! 

Guy. Mons'ous fine clo'se! Clo'se and clo'se and 
clo'se! See me to-night in my clo'se — dance to-night 
at my what-do-you-call-it? (Then as if apprehending 
refusal.) Don't dance in the King's Navy? — Teach 
you, egad, to dance! (More and more falsely fud- 
dled.) Fifth glass. Now for judgment! Judgment 
good. (Hilariously.) Keep it up, toyman! 

Round. The moral of my visit, you know, is that 
I'm positively not a toyman! 

Guy. Then why the missch'f come with little 
box? 

Round. The little box was only a little present 
for the bride. 

Guy. It wasn't for the bridegroom? 

Round. (Filling for him in the exhilaration of 
the success of his own plan.) The best offering for 
the bridegroom, sir, is another bumper of wine! 

Guy. (Stupidly submitting.) Sixth glass — judg- 
ment bad. — Why do you drink so much? (Raising 
his glass.) To the health of old friends! (Holding 
out his hand in foolish amity.) No such comfort in 
trouble as the clasp of the hand of old friends. 
(Then as Round, with a stiff, instinctive scruple, 
holds off from accepting his hand.) We ain't old 
friends? We ain't poor relations? Come I've drunk 
enough to cure me o' pride! 

Round. Then I'll even drink to my cruel cousin! 

Guy. (With his glass raised.) To the good health 
of Mrs. Domville? 

Round. Ah, never — I mean of the girl! 

Guy. (Abruptly, with capricious tipsy irritation.) 



Act Second 171 

Thank you to girl me no "girls" — on such a day 
as this! 

(Enter Mary.) 

Round. (Good humoured.) I mean of the sweet 
young lady! 

Guy. (As abruptly mollified.) I mean of the sweet 
young lady. To the health of the sweet young lady. 
Here she comes, the sweet young lady! Your own 
relation, one of these days my relation, our relation. 
Keep it up! 

Round. Now you see him, Madam, for what he is. 

Guy. Eighth glass. Judgment gone! 

Round. So indecently drunk that his very gross- 
ness belies his professions. 

Guy. I'll be free, free on my wedding day. 

Round. Fly with me now. 

Mary. I cannot! 

Round. You do love him, then? 

Mary. No, no! 

Guy. 'Spedishun of discovery! (Exit Guy.) 

Round. It's me, love, you'll marry tonight! * 

Mary. (Painfully agitated and divided.) How 
can I till I've seen my lord again? He put it to me 
so dreadfully on Sunday that I could save his life. 
My mother has promised to marry him! Over- 
whelmed with debt and difficulty, he has that one 
issue. But she becomes his wife only if / become 
Mr. Domville's! 

Round. You spoke to me often of your mother's 
great taste for the Domvilles — but you never spoke 
to me of yours! 

Mary. I have none. But I felt a private obliga- 
tion to listen to my lord. I don't know what it was 
touched my heart when he went down on his knees 
to me! I thought I might tell him I'd please him — 

* Henry James picked up the dialogue at this point after 
the deletion of the drinking scene. 



172 Guy Domville 

and yet escape with my honour. I believed Mr. 
Domville would guess the truth in time — would set 
me free. But now I must face my lord! 

Round. Mr. Domville holds fast to your money! 

Mary. Don't say that when he's so good to me! 

Round. If he doesn't, he has only to know the 
truth to give you up. 

Mary. He can only know it if I tell him! 

Round. Tell him, then — tell him now. If you 
don't, your heart is false to me! 

Mary. It's not false, but it's cruelly torn. Don't I 
owe a duty to my lord — to repay him for the kind- 
ness of years? 

Round. You owe him no duty that's a sacrifice; 
you're the creature in the world of whom he's least 
entitled to demand one! (After a moment of indeci- 
sion.) I know to-day what I didn't know when we 
parted — what it appears that everyone else knows, 
and what I shouldn't have been fool enough to be 
blind to if I hadn't tasted more of my ship's mess 
than of the London tea-tables, that the man who is 
ready to traffic in your innocence with Jews and 
gamesters — 

Mary. {Crying out with dread.) Ah, what are 
you going to tell me? 

Round. Will you leave this house with me? 

Mary. Not till I learn the worst! 

Round. The Lord Devenish, Madam — is your 
father. 

Mary. (Horror-stricken.) My father! 

Round. (Seeing Guy.) Hush! 

(Re-enter Guy, as much changed from be- 
ginning of Act as between Acts First and 
Second.) 

Guy. (With excited sternness.) Our time is pre- 
cious. You're attached to this lady! 

Round. I'm in the very act of begging her to 



Act Second 173 

place herself under my honourable protection. 

Guy. You're not in danger, Madam — if you're 
unhappy! 

Mary. If you've been deceived, it's not I who first 
deceived you. 

Round. Miss Brasier has been acting from the 
first under compulsion damnable! 

Mary. (To Round.) Will you let me tell him? 

Round. Ah, if you'll be quick! 

Mary. (To Guy.) Will you guard him — will you 
preserve him? 

Guy. You ask strange things of me! But I'll pre- 
serve him the more that I think I've not quite done 
with him. I'm at your service, sir, in any place. 

Mary. (To Round.) Leave me with him! 

Guy. Stay, sir — one word! You put on me just 
now a strange undertaking. 

Round. And what undertaking had you first put 
on me? 

Guy. That's exactly what we shall clear up. 

Mary. (Alarmed.) My mother's coach — she's, 
back! 

Round. Do you wish me, sir, to encounter Mrs. 
Domville? 

Mary. (To Guy.) Will you go and prevent her 
somehow from coming in? 

Guy. (With high emphasis.) You love this gen- 
tleman? 

Mary. I love him. 

Guy. Then I'll do better. Will you pass in there? 

Round. Shall I? 

Mary. Mr. Domville's apartment. 

Guy. Three fine rooms in a row, which I owe to 
the bounty of Mrs. Domville. 

Round. Thank you, sir. 

Guy. (Closes door.) Thank you! sir. (Exit 



174 Guy Domville 

Round.)* To what dire bewilderment am I ex- 
posed? I see — but I only half see; so I've kept you 
here — that in this dire bewilderment, and before 
we lose another moment, I may learn the truth. 

Mary. Our engagement then has been a bargain 
between my mother and my lord! My mother was 
to marry him if you married me. My lord's quite 
ruined — he doesn't know where to turn. 

Guy. And your mother's rich — and I was poor? 

* At this point James had a brief entrance for "Mrs. Dom- 
ville with two milliner's girls" and the following scene, later 
eliminated, ensued: 

Mrs. Domville. You dear inseparables! I understand your 
desire to be together; but I'm afraid that for a moment, (to 
Mary) long enough to pass on a petticoat, I must divide you. 
(To Guy.) You'll make it up later! — You won't give us ten 
minutes, to make sure of the set of a tucker? 

Guy. As many minutes as you need, Madam. On such an 
occasion one can't make too sure! 

Mrs. Domville. You haven't fallen out — at this time of 
day? Wait till you see her in white satin! 

Mary. (Distressed.) Mother! 

Guy. I should like indeed to see you in white satin! 

Mrs. Domville. Then there ain't a moment to lose. May 
we have for five minutes the convenience of your bower? 
(To the Milliners.) Pass in there. 

Guy. (Protecting his door.) Not in here! Forgive me if I 
seem ungracious; but my own preparations — 

Mrs. Domville. Are going on with such taste? I hope 
indeed they're splendid! 

Guy. With a splendour that will surprise you. 

Mrs. Domville. Ah, then we won't spoil it! (To Mary.) 
Come quickly to your room. 

Guy. Suffer me to speak to her first. 

Mrs. Domville (Disconcerted.) After you've had the whole 
day? 

Mary. It doesn't seem enough for what Mr. Domville has 
to say! 

Mrs. Domville. The rascal has a tongue — even with me! 

Guy. It's to settle a question of weight! 

Mrs. Domville. Settle your question — but look at that 
shawl! 

(Exit Mrs. Domville with the Milliners.) 



Act Second 175 

Mary. You had the great name. She clings to 
that. 

Guy. If his lordship caught me, he was to be 
paid? 

Mary. Paid high! His lordship caught you! 

Guy. Like a blind bat in a handkerchief. While I 
wondered at his love of the chase! 

Mary. These things were dark to you — and 
they've but just grown clear to me. 

Guy. Dark as deceit! Dark as dishonour! I be- 
lieved too easily. I was tempted. You were offered 
to me — pressed upon me. And you were fair. You 
were given to me with a lie — a bribe! They de- 
clared you were free — were happy. Your submission 
itself misled me, for you suffered when you had 
only to speak. 

Mary. I suffered, but I went on — I thought I 
was gaining time. Time, I mean, for you to see. But 
you were too dazzled. 

Guy. I was dazzled by life! 

Mary. You see what life is. 

Guy. Some of it, yes. Why should you have feared 
to disappoint me, when I was nothing to you? 

Mary. It wasn't you — it was my lord. 

Guy. He's nothing to you. 

Mary. He's my father. 

Guy. {Aghast.) Your father? 

Mary. I didn't know it then — I've known it but 
a moment. It makes strange things clear — the force 
of his appeal. That appeal was like a voice that 
cried to me to make a sacrifice of my affection. I 
tried, but it was more than I could do. 

Guy. You paid for my folly, for my madness — 
you paid for the vices of others! And now we pay 
together! 

Mary. (With decision.) We've paid enough — 
we're free! 

Guy. / haven't paid — what I've cost you. (Won- 



176 Guy Domville 

dering, harking back.) He's your father? 

Mary. It had to come (indicating Round's ref- 
uge) from him! It makes all the past confused. 

Guy. And what does it make your mother? 

Mary. Forgive my mother! 

Guy. God pity us all! How can you forgive me 
for doing you so great a wrong? 

Mary. You're already forgiven! 

Guy. Ask him to forgive me. He had never 
harmed me. But I've hurt myself most; for I've 
been deluded with a delusion that was built upon 
an injury to others. It was to flaunt in it here that 
I was brought. But that's over. Good-bye. 

Mary. Good-bye. 

Guy. Yet if I go, how can I leave you to them? 

Mary. Ah. Let me not look on them! 

Guy. Shall I commit you rather to the man you 
love? 

Mary. Trust him! 

Guy. Then join him there. Here is a key that 
opens the door on the river. 

Mary. He has a boat, thank God. (Devenish is 
heard off centre calling, "Guy — Guy.") 

Guy. (Coming down from the window.) His 
lordship — be quick! 

Mary. (Apprehensive.) But you? 

Guy. Me? I'll look on him! (With a laugh of bit- 
terness.) It serves me right! 

Mary. (Carrying his hand to her lips.) Heaven 
do as much for you! (Exit Mary.) 

(Re-enter Lord Devenish.) 

Lord Devenish. My chaplain's robing — but you, 
dear boy, are not! 

Guy. I've been here till this moment with Mary 
— engaging her closely, I promise you! 

Lord Devenish. (Laughing.) I know the way 
you engage! You shall have guests enough — and 
noble ones. I put my hand on a score. 



Act Second 177 

Guy. But none so noble as yourself, my lord! 

Lord Devenish. I'm a neat figure, eh? 

Guy. Scented like a duchess! Beams of light in 
clouds of fragrance! 

Lord Devenish. Do I dazzle? — I love a fine 
odour! (Holding out his gloves.) Carry that to your 
nose! 

Guy. (Sniffing.) My nose is regaled! (Looking at 
the gloves.) Something French, you prodigal? To 
the finger-tips! And every seam silver! 

Lord Devenish. Straight from Paris. They set 
one off! Take 'em, my son. 

Guy. (Disconcerted.) Take 'em? 

Lord Devenish. Wear 'em to hand the bride. I've 
given you nothing. 

Guy. You've given me too much, my lord! 

Lord Devenish. Well, as you like! But you must 
be none the less a figure. 

Guy. (With a laugh.) I've had a notion of my 
own for that! 

Lord Devenish. Then quick, man; change! 

Guy. I'll change! (Exit.) 

Lord Devenish. He's half a monk still! (Then 
laughing.) But to-morrow — ! (Re-enter Mrs. Dom- 
ville followed by two Milliners carrying boxes.) 
Ah, you at least are ready! 

Mrs. Domville. Is Mary here? 

Lord Devenish. She was here till a moment 
since. 

Mrs. Domville. I've been to her room with 
these women. 

Lord Devenish. Guy's dressing — we shall have a 
company! 

Mrs. Domville. We must first have a bride — 
and at least a footman! 

Lord Devenish. The footmen are dressing too — 
making up white favours. 



178 Guy Domville 

Mrs. Domville. I bade them be brave — but not 
stone deaf! 

Lord Devenish. The rascals are all at the barber's! 

Mrs. Domville. (Calling out.) Mary — Mary! — 
The hussy! 

Lord Devenish. (Calling.) Mary! Mary! 

Mrs. Domville. Is she in there? 

Lord Devenish. With Guy? Go and see. 
(Exit Mrs. Domville to Guy's apartment, 
where she is heard knocking and calling 
"Cousin, cousin! Daughter, daughter]" 
Lord Devenish, alone. Enter a Footman.) 

Lord Devenish. You've come from above. Is Miss 
Mary there? 

Footman. I've come across the water, my lord. 
Miss Brasier's left the house. 

Lord Devenish. Left it for where? 

Footman. I've taken a guinea, my lord, not to 
say. 

Lord Devenish. Then take another, damn you, to 
do your duty. 

Footman. By my duty then, my lord, she's off 
in a great boat, a gentleman close beside her and 
three watermen to pull. 

Lord Devenish. The boat of a man of war. The 
ruffian, the serpent! 

(Enter Mrs. Domville.) 

Mrs. Domville. He's locked in. I'll be hanged if 
he'll answer. 

Lord Devenish. This knave has sufficiently an- 
swered. The hussy's gone with the villain she was 
leagued with and who reached here in time. 

Mrs. Domville. And you saw it, and gave no 
alarm! 

Footman. I only saw, Madam, what Mr. Dom- 
ville himself saw. He waved his hat from the terrace. 

Lord Devenish. Domville, the false wretch, has 
abetted them. 



Act Second 179 

Mrs. Domville. Pursue them. Start the hue and 
cry! 

Lord Devenish. Be off! The horse is stolen and 
it's all too late. From the moment they met we were 
dished. Let them go! 

Mrs. Domville. (Horrified,) Go and be married? 

Lord Devenish. Go and be damned. We still have 
Guy! He's as much of a Domville as ever! He can 
still have heirs. 

Mrs. Domville. He can — but / can't! 

Lord Devenish. Not of your body — but of your 
vows. Mary he never loved! 

Mrs. Domville. More shame to him. 

Lord Devenish. He's in love with Mrs. Peverel. 

Mrs. Domville. (Highly impatient.) So are you, 
I believe, from the way you prate of her! 

Lord Devenish. If I prate of her now, it's because 
our contract stands. 

Mrs. Domville. How does it stand, when you've 
not performed your task? 

Lord Devenish. My task, Madam, was not to hold 
Mary — it was to hold Guy! We do hold him, i'faith 
— through the blessed lady of Porches. If I don't 
demonstrate that — if I don't please you still — 

Mrs. Domville. (Taking the words out of his 
mouth.) I may then turn you off? God knows I will! 

Lord Devenish. And not, Madam, before! We can 
catch Mrs. Peverel — if we act in time: from this 
moment forth she's the only woman he'll look at. 
She'll retrieve our defeat. 

Mrs. Domville. (Breathless.) Where are you 
going? 

Lord Devenish. To Porches again — to see she 
doesn't marry her neighbour. (Elated with his idea; 
confident.) You'll marry yours! ( Exit in hot haste.) 

Mrs. Domville. I believe I shall — before he has 
done with me! (Then as she sees Guy.) Mercy on 
us! (Re-enter Guy Domville in plain array.) What 



180 Guy Domville 

on earth, sir, have you done? 

Guy. I think, Madam, I've done justice. I've seen 
them on their way. 

Mrs. Domville. Their way's a fine one! 

Guy. It seems to me finer than mine has been. 
It seems to me finer even than yours! 

Mrs. Domville. (Dismayed.) Mine? 

Guy. Yours. 

Mrs. Domville. (Conscious, faltering.) Does she 
— know? 

Guy. She knows. She made me know. I helped 
her. Farewell! 

Mrs. Domville. (In anguish, with a supreme 
appeal.) Cousin! 

Guy. (Inexorable.) Farewell! 

Mrs. Domville. Where are you going? 

Guy. I'm going back! (Exit.) 



ACT THIRD 

The White Parlour at Porches. Door from the 
hall left; door to the bookroom right. Mrs. Peverel 
is seated by fire. Enter Fanny from the hall with 
a letter on a tray. 

Fanny. A letter, please, ma'am. (Then as Mrs. 
Peverel, gazing at fire, doesn't answer.) Please, 
ma'am, a letter. 

Mrs. Peverel. (Starting at last; eager.) A letter? 
(On looking at it, disappointed, uninterested, tosses 
it down unopened.) Oh! 

Fanny. And a whole shilling to pay, ma'am. 
(Then, as Mrs. Peverel has dropped again into 
her reverie.) He'll take nothing less than a shilling, 
ma'am. 

Mrs. Peverel. (Vaguely roused.) A shilling? 

Fanny. (Picking the letter up.) It's a deal to 
pay for a letter to lie on the floor! 

Mrs. Peverel. Give him a shilling, child, and 
hold your tongue! 

Fanny. But where am I to find the shilling, 
ma'am? — 

Mrs. Peverel. With my money — where my money 
is. 

Fanny. But where' s your "money" in these dull 
days? (Then perceiving a coin on the dresser.) 
Here's a piece, ma'am. 

Mrs. Peverel. Then give it to him! 

Fanny. (Dismayed.) Give it all? 

Mrs.* Peverel. (With an irritated, bored move- 
181 



182 Guy Domville 

ment, takes the coin from her; then without looking 
at it.) Here's your money, man. Go! 

Fanny. (Aghast.) Why, it was half a crown! 

Mrs. Peverel. I didn't heed! 

Fanny. There are few things you do "heed," 
ma'am, just now! 

Mrs. Peverel. There's one thing I must! (Indi- 
cating a hook lying on a cabinet.) Is that book 
Latin? 

Fanny. Laws, ma'am, how should / know? (Giv- 
ing the book as if almost awestruck.) Are you 
taking to "Latin," ma'am? 

Mrs. Peverel. For my son's lesson. Please tell 
him to come in and have it. 

Fanny. He won't come in for my telling, ma'am. 

Mrs. Peverel. (Flinging the book down dis- 
heartenedly.) And he won't come in for mine! 

Fanny. He'd only come in for a gentleman, I 
think. 

Mrs. Peverel. (Musing.) He must feel a stronger 
hand! 

Fanny. Such another as Mr. Domville's! 

Mrs. Peverel. There isn't "such another"! Mr. 
Domville's was so strong — yet Mr. Domville's was 
so light. 

Fanny. (Glancing down complacently, while she 
gives it a turn, at the pocket of her apron.) Mr. 
Domville was so free! 

Mrs. Peverel. (With latent bitterness.) Well, 
it's not "free" now! 

Fanny. Do you mean he has lost money? 

Mrs. Peverel. (Dryly.) He has gained it. By his 
marriage. 

Fanny. Mercy, ma'am, is he married? 

Mrs. Peverel. By this time — to-day. 

Fanny. And he quite the same as a priest! 

Mrs. Peverel. He's not quite the same. He never 
was! 



Act Third 183 

Fanny. Well, if he was here he'd pay for a 
fiddler — to make us all dance for his wedding! 

Mrs. Peverel. He'll never be here again! 

Fanny. (Sad, wistful.) Nor any other gentleman 
at all? (Prompt.) I mean for the Latin! 

Mrs. Peverel. I'm looking for another. There 
should certainly be one. 

Fanny. (Diplomatic.) I suppose they're precious 
hard to come by! 

Mrs. Peverel. (With a weary sigh.) Especially 
if one doesn't look! 

Fanny. (Circumspect, after a silence.) Mr. Hum- 
ber, ma'am — does he know Latin? 

Mrs. Peverel. I haven't the least idea what Mr. 
Humber knows! 

Fanny. / have, ma'am — for one thing: he knows 
Mr. George is mighty fond of him. 

Mrs. Peverel. If Mr. George is mighty fond, Mr. 
George is mighty fickle! Mr. George shifts his 
affections! 

Fanny. Mr. Humber don't — do he, ma'am? — Mr. 
Humber, ma'am, is constant. 

Mrs. Peverel. (With a sudden flare of irritation 
and perversity.) Then why hasn't he been here for 
weeks? 

Fanny. (At the window, startled.) Law, ma'am, 
he is here now! He's at the door in his coach! 

Mrs. Peverel. (More capriciously still, with 
decision.) Then he mustn't get out! 

Fanny. He is out — he's coming in. 

Mrs. Peverel. I won't see him. (Dismissing 
Fanny, getting her off.) Meet him — stop him — 
send him away! (Exit Fanny.) I won't see him! 
(After an instant.) I can't! (After another instant.) 
I oughtn't! 

(Re-enter Fanny, breathless.) 

Fanny. He's on the stairs — now! 



184 Guy Domville 

Mrs. Peverel. Then I must be tidy! (Exit hastily 
to the bookroom.) 

(Enter Frank Humber.) 

Fanny. She's in the bookroom — shell come. 

Frank. Thank you, Fanny. What's the good news 
at Porches? 

Fanny. There's neither good nor bad at Porches, 
sir; but there's wonderful news at Richmond. Mr. 
Domville's married to-day! (Exit to the hall.) 

Frank. (Immediately affected.) To-day? — Will 
that help me? Nothing will help me! (Re-enter 
Mrs. Peverel.) You must wonder at the motive 
of my visit. 

Mrs. Peverel. It was never my wish that you 
should never come back. 

Frank. It was once mine. It was at least my 
purpose. 

Mrs. Peverel. (Kindly.) I rejoice in your re- 
covery from so desperate a mood. 

Frank. If it was a mood, Madam, it was a mood 
that has remained. The purpose I speak of has 
grown. 

Mrs. Peverel. Then your visit is certainly odd! 

Frank. It's worse than "odd" — it's abject! But 
I've ceased to pretend to make a figure! 

Mrs. Peverel. You place me in the painful posi- 
tion of scarce being able to show you that I'm 
sorry to see you so altered. 

Frank. I doubt not you're sorry, Madam — and 
there can be nought but sorrow between us. I'm 
leaving the country. 

Mrs. Peverel. (Surprised.) For where — for what? 

Frank. For the ends of the earth — and for every- 
thing! 

Mrs. Peverel. (Anxious.) For a long time? 

Frank. For ever! 

Mrs. Peverel. (Astonished, compassionately re- 
monstrant.) But your estate? your home? 



Act Third 185 

Frank. What use have I for a "home" — a home 
empty and barren? We're neighbours, after all, till 
I go; so I come to take leave of you. 

Mrs. Peverel. You go to travel? 

Frank. I go to wander. 

Mrs. Peverel. And who goes with you? 

Frank. I go alone. 

Mrs. Peverel. Alone into strange lands — alone 
into exile? 

Frank. It's better than alone here: close to you, 
yet separate! 

Mrs. Peverel. It seems to me then it's / who 
ought to go! 

Frank. {Startled, flickering up.) If you do, I'll 
follow you! 

Mrs. Peverel. Then I'll stay! (Sadly smiling.) 
I'll not follow you! 

Frank. I wish you a long life — in all this tran- 
quillity! 

Mrs. Peverel. I shall remember you well — I shall 
miss you much. I'm not a woman of many friends 
— I've not a life of many diversions. This country 
will seem an empty place. 

Frank. All the more that I can recall, without a 
reminder, the loss you lately suffered. 

Mrs. Peverel. As I can allude to it without a 
scruple. Mr. Domville's a support — withdrawn. Do 
you know what happens to-day? 

Frank. (With a glance at the clock.) It's over? 

Mrs. Peverel. It's over. I wish him all happiness 
and length of days! 

Frank. I wish him all peace and plenty! Plenty 
of children, I mean! A numerous and virtuous 
posterity! 

Mrs. Peverel. (Abrupt, irrelevant.) Is your beau- 
tiful house to be closed? 

Frank. It will always be open to you. It's full of 
my grandmother's books — old novels in ten vol- 



186 Guy Domville 

umes. If you lack diversions you can go and take 
down the "Grand Cyrus" * or eat pearsf in the 
great garden. 

Mrs. Peverel. (With a frank smile.) Along with 
the child? Do you want to kill him? There are too 
many pears for him here! 

Frank. (Beguiled, with a laugh.) Is he perched 
even now in a tree? 

Mrs. Peverel. Well go anon together and pull 
him out! — What strange land do you go to first? 

Frank. (Impatiently.) What does it matter, when 
they're all strange alike? 

Mrs. Peverel. (With sudden feeling.) Mr. Hum- 
ber — forsake this wild plan! Don't give up your 
own lands and your own people — don't give up 
the sweet, safe things you love! 

Frank. (With a newborn, unexpected tremor 
of hope and suspense.) Don't give you up — is that 
what you mean? 

Mrs. Peverel. I mean — (Faltering.) I mean—! 
(Re-enter Fanny.) 

Fanny. (Loudly announcing.) My Lord Dev- 
enish! 

(Enter Lord Devenish.) 

Lord Devenish. I came in the hope of finding 
you alone, Madam. 

Mrs. Peverel. Mr. Humber is going to a great 
distance. He is here to bid me good-bye. 

Lord Devenish. Well, if that affecting ceremony 
is over I should like the honour of half-an-hour's 
conversation with Mrs. Peverel. 

Frank. (Disconcerted, resentful.) That affecting 
ceremony is by no means "over"! 

* Artamene, ou le Grand Cyrus, a French heroic romance 
by Madeleine de Scudery (1607-1701) was published in ten 
volumes between the years 1649-53. Tne translation was very 
popular in England. 

f James originally wrote "plums" then substituted "pears.'" 



Act Third 187 

Lord Devenish. (Unperturbed.) May I none the 
less, in view of the extreme importance of time 
in the case, venture to ask Mrs. Peverel for an im- 
mediate interview? 

Mrs. Peverel. I've no doubt Mr. Humber will 
excuse me, since (smiling at Frank) I'm sure his 
haste is less than yours! 

Frank. (Significantly.) My haste, thank God, is 
less than when I came, Madam! 

Lord Devenish. That's good news if it refers to 
Mr. Humber's leaving the country. 

Mrs. Peverel. (To Frank.) If you must go — 

Frank. (In suspense.) If I must go? 

Mrs. Peverel. (Smiling.) You can first pull Geor- 
die out of the tree! 

Frank. (Displeased, with decision.) I'll get into 
it with him! (Exit.) 

Lord Devenish. Mr. Domville, Madam, is free! 
His wonderful marriage is off! 

Mrs. Peverel. (Astonished.) And what has oc- 
curred to stay it? 

Lord Devenish. Everything has occurred — and 
on top of everything my coming down here to tell 
you so. You may expect Mr. Domville in this place, 
and I judged it wise to prepare you for his return. 
To that good end I've got here first. 

Mrs. Peverel. (Anxious.) Does he follow anon? 

Lord Devenish. Oh, not till he has turned round, 
I conceive — found his feet and recovered his fall 
from the height of his great match. In honest terms, 
Madam, he has been misused. 

Mrs. Peverel. (Startled, with indignation.) 
Jilted? — Such a man? 

Lord Devenish. By practices most underhand! 
The young lady was clandestine! 

Mrs. Peverel. She must have been abominable! 

Lord Devenish. (Just visibly wincing.) She was 



188 Guy Domville 

beguiled, Madam, by a villain! — Mr. Domville has 
suffered much. 

Mrs. Peverel. I vow I pity him! 

Lord Devenish. He knows that you must! 

Mrs. Peverel. And that's why he's coming? I shall 
indeed be kind to him! 

Lord Devenish. Kind, Madam, but firm! Firm 
with his inclination. 

Mrs. Peverel. (Struck, apprehensive.) You mean 
he'll take up again — 

Lord Devenish. The cruel profession he forsook? 
That's the fear that has brought me! Suffer him, 
Madam, not to! You'll find a way when you see 
him. You'll see a braver gentleman; greater by the 
greatness I've taught him! 

Mrs. Peverel. (Much interested.) He must have 
a different air! 

Lord Devenish. Finer, Madam, and nobler! To 
stifle such an air in a cassock — 

Mrs. Peverel. Would be a grievous sin! But why, 
if he's only dejected, should he come to this dull 
place? 

Lord Devenish. (With great intended effect, as if 
having waited for just the right moment to make 
the revelation.) "Why," Madam? Because he loves 
you! Because he worships you! 

Mrs. Peverel. (Astounded, confounded.) And 
yet was so ready to wed another woman? 

Lord Devenish. Overborne by Mrs. Domville! He 
never loved Miss Brasier. 

Mrs. Peverel. (Catching her breath; stupefied.) 
Never loved her? 

Lord Devenish. He feels the indignity, but not 
the loss; and he had never dreamed that with you, 
who had only known him as the tutor of your son 
and the nursling of the Church, there was the 
smallest human hope for him. The way to save 



Act Third 189 

him is to give it to him! That, Madam, is the truth 
I came to utter. Having satisfied my conscience, I 
retire. To pay another visit in the West. (Invitingly, 
persuasively.) I shall not be too far to hear from 
you. 

Mrs. Peverel. To hear, I judge you mean, from 
Mr. Domville. 

Lord Devenish. I bow to your modesty! But Mr. 
Domville had better not know — 

Mrs. Peverel. Of your lordship's kind warning? 

Lord Devenish. Don't advertise my kindness! 

Mrs. Peverel. Your presence will be the talk 
of the village. 

Lord Devenish. The village is dumb — my car- 
riage is a mile off. 

Mrs. Peverel. And you walk back to it? 

Lord Devenish. (Smiling, urbane, successful, with 
the movement of complacently swinging a cane,) 
Across the quiet fields! 

Mrs. Peverel. But Mr. Humber has seen you. 

Lord Devenish. Isn't Mr. Humber going? 

Mrs. Peverel. (After an instant.) I can't answer 
for it! 

Lord Devenish. (Smiling.) I should have 
thought it the thing in the world you could most 
answer for! Ask him to hold his tongue! 

Mrs. Peverel. (Embarrassed, considering.) I'm 
scarce in a position to ask him a service. 

Lord Devenish. (As if struck by a new and in- 
tenser idea.) Then send him to me! 

(Re-enter Fanny, carrying a tray of re- 
freshments and wine, which she places on 
a table.) 

Mrs. Peverel. I'll send him! (To Fanny.) What 
wine have you brought? 

Fanny. The best, ma'am — and the other. 

Mrs. Peverel. (Smiling at Lord Devenish.) 
Don't give his lordship the "other"! (Exit.) 



190 Guy Domville 

Fanny. (Pouring out wine.) Mr. Domville, my 
lord, used to like it! 

Lord Devenish. (After he has tasted the wine.) 
Mr. Domville wouldn't like it now! 

Fanny. I suppose there's much better in London. 

Lord Devenish. (Amused.) There's nothing 
much better in London, my dear, than a pretty 
country lass! 

Fanny. (Curtseying low.) Oh, my lord! 

Lord Devenish. (Quickly.) Go away! 

(Re-enter Frank Humber. Exit Fanny.) 

Frank. Your lordship desires my company? 

Lord Devenish. (Pouring out a second glass.) To 
have a glass with you. (Then after a conscious pre- 
tence, on each side, of drinking.) Mr. Domville's 
in love with this lady! 

Frank. (Blank.) In the very act of marrying 
another? 

Lord Devenish. He's not in the act. The act's 
undone; through his coldness at the last. The young 
lady guessed it — the young lady broke! 

Frank. (Amazed.) And he took back his word? 

Lord Devenish. (Very ready.) She took back 
hers! He retired in silence, conscious of his secret 
preference. 

Frank. (After a moment; coldly, stiffly.) The 
object of such a preference is surely most con- 
cerned — ! 

Lord Devenish. That object, sir, he has never 
addressed! — Do you conceive that Mrs. Peverel 
would listen to him? 

Frank. (Dryly.) I know nothing about it. How 
is it I can serve your lordship? 

Lord Devenish. (Consciously rebuffed, but still 
assured.) By acting a noble part. It rests with you 
to rout Father Murray. (With commanding au- 
thority.) Mr. Domville must marry! 

Frank. (Struck, sombre.) Marry Mrs. Peverel? 



Act Third 191 

Lord Devenish. Understand that he may! 

Frank. What prevents his understanding? 

Lord Devenish. (Very pointedly.) If you know 
of nothing, sir, the question I wish to ask you is 
answered! 

Frank. (Deeply troubled, thinking.) He loves 
her — Guy? 

Lord Devenish. Did you never scent it? 

Frank. Why, he spoke to her for me, when, never 
supposing, never dreaming, I pushed him to 't! 

Lord Devenish. (Decided.) Then that, of course, 
prevents him! 

Frank. (Still realizing, remembering.) For me — 
poor wretch — when he loved her himself! 

Lord Devenish. Mr. Domville was magnanimous! 

Frank. He was heroic! You call upon me to be 
so, my lord. There's only one way! Not to talk of 
absence, but to practise absence. If I'm gone, he'll 
know why! 

Lord Devenish. I'll take care he knows why! 
(Re-enter Mrs. Peverel.) 

Mrs. Peverel. (Breathless.) Mr. Domville! His 
carriage has entered the gate. 

Frank. (Strongly disconcerted.) And I'm not off! 

Lord Devenish. (Deeply dismayed.) And I still 
less! (At left, hurriedly.) I leave you, Madam. 

Mrs. Peverel. Not that way — you'll meet him! 

Frank. (Putting out his hand to Mrs. Peverel.) 
Farewell! 

Mrs. Peverel. (Keeping his hand.) You won't 
wait to take leave of him? 

Lord Devenish. (Pressing.) You should do that, 
Mr. Humber! (Then while Frank gives a gesture 
of pained resignation.) How then am I to go? 

Mrs. Peverel. (Anxious, at a loss.) Some other 
way! 

Frank. (Surprised.) Your visit's private? 

Lord Devenish. (Angrily.) Private! 



192 Guy Domville 

Frank. (Amusedly.) His step's on the stair! Here 
he comes! 

Mrs. Peverel. (Quickly, at the door right.) Pass 
in! 

(Exit Lord Devenish on tiptoe.) 

Frank. The bookroom — with no way out? 

Mrs. Peverel. (Ruefully.) None at all! (Then 
making the best of it.) I'll free him! — Silence! 
(Enter Guy Domville.) 

Guy. (After having looked hard an instant from 
Mrs. Peverel to Frank.) Forgive the old trick in 
the old place — I've come up as I used to come up. 

Mrs. Peverel. And you're welcome as you used 
to be welcome! 

Guy. The abruptness of my return deserves, I 
fear, less honour. 

Mrs. Peverel. It shall have all we can give it — 
and that of some instant preparation for your 
staying. 

Guy. Madam, I didn't come to quarter myself — 

Mrs. Peverel. (Ironic.) Anywhere but on the 
baker? 

Guy. I sent on my shay to the inn. 

Mrs. Peverel. It shall come back! (Exit.) 

Guy. (After precautions; in eager suspense.) Has 
she accepted you? 

Frank. She has not accepted me! 

Guy. Then, since I helped you, spoke for you, did 
everything I could for you, I tell you that she's 
dearer to me than life, that I'm not bound but 
free, and that I've come back again to tell her so! 

Frank. I know to what tune she's "dear" to you! 

Guy. (Astonished.) You know it? 

Frank. Take care! 

(Re-enter Mrs. Peverel.) 

Mrs. Peverel. I've sent for your shay. 

Guy. (Gratefully resigned.) Then I'm in your 
hands! (Unsuspiciously, to Frank.) You're going? 



Act Third 193 

Frank. (Impenetrable.) I'm going! 

Guy. But I shall see you again! 

Frank. You'll have to be alert! And only, too, 
if so soon again this lady will consent to part with 
you. 

Mrs. Peverel. (Smiling.) I think it will be found 
that the consent most necessary is Geordie's. 

Guy. (Completely genial.) And how is that vic- 
tim of the rudiments? Would he come and absolve 
his tormentor? 

Mrs. Peverel. In a moment, if he knew you were 
here. 

Guy. Then won't you let him know? 

Frank. I'll acquaint him! 

Mrs. Peverel. (Demurring, embarrassed.) Not 
yet, please: say nothing! I've a reason for his not 
romping in! 

Guy. (To Frank.) I shall overtake you before 
you mount. 

Frank. (In weary self-derision). I shall only 
mount a cushion. 

Guy. You drove? 

Frank. Like a helpless fat dowager— in an old 
yellow coach. 

Guy. (Concerned.) Do you mean to say you're 
ill? 

Mrs. Peverel. (Significantly.) He knows the way 
to get better! (The more gaily, to Frank.) Keep 
Geordie quiet! (Frank, at the door, looks at her 
fixedly a moment, as if on the point of saying 
something; then checking himself, exit rapidly.) 
I needn't keep you here. We can talk as well — any- 
where. 

Guy. Shall we go into the garden? 

Mrs. Peverel. (Demurring.) We shall have the 
child! 

Guy. (Suggesting the bookroom.) Then in there? 

Mrs. Peverel. No — it's encumbered! 



ig4 Guy Domville 

Guy. {Looking about him appreciatively, fondly.) 
This old White Parlour has the friendly face to 
me! I've seen it, since we parted, in visions — I've 
missed it in grander places. Its panelled walls close 
me in — the tick of the clock seems to greet me. It's 
full of faint echoes and of lost things found again. 
We sat here o' winter nights. 

Mrs. Peverel. (Coerced by his tone, wishing not 
to break the spell.) Then we can sit here again! 

Guy. I think it was for that I came back! 

Mrs. Peverel. (Smiling.) On the eve of your 
great marriage? 

Guy. That eve has had no morrow! 

Mrs. Peverel. I fear you've been shamefully used! 

Guy. Not by the person in whom I liked most to 
believe. That person was honest. But I think that, 
save at Porches, there are very few others who are. 

Mrs. Peverel. At Porches — if we're not much else 
— we're honest! 

Guy. That's why my heart turned back to you 
and why my footsteps ran a race with it! — Do you 
remember how, at the last, we talked together of 
the world? 

Mrs. Peverel. You said all manner of ill of it! 

Guy. I told you I'd come back to say more. I've 
seen it — and it doesn't answer! 

Mrs. Peverel. You must describe to me what 
you've seen. 

Guy. Ah, much of it I wish to forget! 

Mrs. Peverel. What you must forget is that 
you've suffered. 

Guy. What I must forget is that I've strayed! — 
from the happiness that was near to the happiness 
that was far! 

Mrs. Peverel. But the happiness that was "near" 
was a life you had put away. 

Guy. The happiness that was near was a treasure 



Act Third 195 

not mine to touch 1 I believed that treasure then 
to be another's. 

Mrs. Peverel. You had too great things to think 
of — and now I see how they've changed you. You 
hold yourself in another way. 

Guy. (Smiling.) I try to carry my "name"! 

Mrs. Peverel. (Triumphant, to prove how right 
she has been.) You carry it better than you did! 

Guy. People have cried me up for it. But the 
better the name, the better the man should be. 

Mrs. Peverel. He can't be better than when his 
duty prevails. 

Guy. Sometimes that duty is darkened, and then 
it shines again! It lighted my way as I came, and 
it's bright in my eyes at this hour. But the bright- 
ness, in truth, is yours — it grows and grows in your 
presence. Better than anything I sought or found 
is that purer passion — this calm retreat! (Then on 
an ironic movement of Mrs. Peverel's.) Aye, calm, 
Madam (struck with the sight of Lord Devenish's 
white gloves), save for these! I've seen them before 
— I've touched them. (Thinking, recalling; then 
with light breaking.) At Richmond! 

Mrs. Peverel. (Deeply discomposed, at a loss.) 
My Lord Devenish left them. 

Guy. (Astounded.) Was he here? 

Mrs. Peverel. An hour ago. 

Guy. And for what? 

Mrs. Peverel. (Seeking a pretext.) To see Mr. 
Humber. — He was passing to the West — to see a 
friend — and stopped to pay me his compliments. 
As Mr. Humber happened to be here, he had no 
occasion to seek further. He asked me not to put 
it about. 

Guy. (Abrupt, intense.) What does he want of 
Frank? 

Mrs. Peverel. Ah, that you must ask him! 



196 Guy Domville 

Guy. (With a start.) His lordship? Not yet! — I 
must ask Frank! 

Mrs. Peverel. I meant Mr. Humber. 

Guy. (Thinking, sharply demurring. Dismissing 
this as impossible. Then as he sees Fanny: re-enter 
Fanny.) Has Mr. Humber gone? 

Fanny. Mr. George won't let him! 

Mrs. Peverel. Ask him to please come back! 
(Exit Fanny.) Can you think of no good motive — ? 

Guy. For his lordship's presence here? — Have 
you got one to tell me? 

Mrs. Peverel. (Making a visibly immense, a 
quite pathetic effort.) He came to let me know — 

Guy. (In suspense.) To let you know? 

Mrs. Peverel. (Checking herself, giving it up 
with a motion of disappointment.) Mr. Humber! 
(Re-enter Frank Humber. Exit Mrs. 
Peverel.) 

Guy. (With excited abruptness.) I know my 
Lord Devenish is here! 

Frank. (Surprised.) Mrs. Peverel has told you? 

Guy. He betrayed himself. (Pointing to the 
gloves.) For a conspirator, he's careless! 

Frank. (Loyally feigning blankness.) Is he a 
"conspirator"? 

Guy. In what other character can he have stolen 
such an extraordinary march? (With passionate 
earnestness.) Frank — what has he come to obtain 
of you? It was you he came to have speech of? 

Frank. (Grave, impenetrable.) He has had it! 

Guy. And to what end, please? 

Frank. To the end that I'm leaving England for 
ever. 

Guy. (Bewildered.) To go where? 

Frank. Anywhere that's far enough! 

Guy. (With fresh dismay.) For that man? 

Frank. For myself. For everyone! 

Guy. (Peremptory.) For me, Frank? 



Act Third 197 

Frank. (Still evasive.) For peace — for life! 

Guy. But at his strange suit — his instance? 

Frank. He thinks it right! 

Guy. (With a bitter laugh.) What he thinks right 
won't do! He came to undermine you! 

Frank. It didn't matter — I saw my duty. 

Guy. Your duty to whom? 

Frank. To myself! 

Guy. If it was so clear, why were you at Porches? 

Frank. (Passing this question by.) And my duty 
to you. Don't I know you love her? 

Guy. (Quick.) You didn't know till I told you! 

Frank. On the contrary, you saw I did! 

Guy. (Recalling, seeing clear.) Devenish told 
you — betrayed me? 

Frank. He rendered you a service! 

Guy. His "services" are selfish. His services are 
base. His offices are curst! (Explaining to himself 
now completely, and as if, therefore, to Frank.) He 
got here first to practise on my freedom, on my 
honour. He guessed my secret, and he used it! He 
has driven you from home. 

Frank. Not he, man! My own discomfort. 

Guy. Your own discomfort is his lordship's own 
plan — the fruit of his visit! 

Frank. The fruit of my miserable failure! 

Guy. Is it your miserable failure that brings you 
— without a warrant — to the feet of this lady? 

Frank. I only came to tell her I'm going. 

Guy. And let that danger plead for you? (Tri- 
umphantly.) Frank — you had a hope! 

Frank. (After an instant, pleading guilty.) Well, 
I had one spark! 

Guy. Which was quick to be a flame! His lord- 
ship quenched it. 

Frank. (Convicted, confessing.) His lordship ar- 
rived — it went out! He told me you were free again. 

Guy. 'Tree — free"? Free only to undo? My free- 



198 Guy Domville 

dom, verily, is vast! My freedom, Frank, is wonder- 
ful! My freedom's a boon to his lordship! (Then in 
a sudden different tone, still sarcastically but omi- 
nously.) He shouldn't touch my freedom! For me 
these things are done, and for me another good man 
suffers? 

Frank. You did what you could for me three 
months ago — I'm ready to help you now. 

Guy. Help me by considering that I hold you 
fast! I've known you long, sir: I wish you no man- 
ner of ill. 

Frank. {Moved, perplexed) Then what am I to 
believe? 

Guy. Not that I do a damage wherever I turn! 
I was called into the "world" — but I didn't come 
for sorrow! I cost no pang, as I was! 

Frank. My dear fellow — you don't know! 

Guy. {Struck, wondering.) Do you know, Frank? 

Frank. {Turning away.) Ask me not too much! * 
{Re-enter Mrs. Peverel.) 

Mrs. Peverel. It's a simple case of conscience — 
I must free his lordship! 

Frank. He's in there! 

Guy. {Astonished, then smiling.) All this while? 

Mrs. Peverel. {Gravely.) He has had patience! 

Guy. {Imperatively checking her.) He'll have to 
have more! There's something I wish to say to you 

* At this point James wrote the following speech for Guy, 
later deleting it: 

Guy. (Gazing before him; visionary) I only see what I see! 
Such a counsel — was no counsel; such a duty — was none! 
They offered me "life"! But "life" — for me — is evil! It's 
planted in a sacrifice of others. I put that away yesterday, 
to meet it again to-day. (With clear resolution.) I put it 
away once more — for a sacrifice that's all my own. The high 
call I obeyed had a hidden vice, a fatal flaw, which the 
other call has not. It was all a wild error — a wild error from 
the first; a dark sophistication — and a snare! I bend, Frank, 
to my lesson! 



Act Third 199 

first. (To Frank.) Will you do me the favour of 
letting his lordship know that I've arrived and of 
asking him if I may wait upon him? (Exit Frank 
to the bookroom. After an instant, solemnly.) I'm 
the last of the Domvilles! Three months ago — in 
that dear old garden — you spoke to me, with elo- 
quence, for my line. / believed what you said to me 
— and I went forth into the world to test it. That 
belief has passed away. But the older, the higher 
abides. I tried to forget it — I did my best. But in 
this place again (looking round him as if with the 
rush of old memories) it comes back to me, it 
surrounds me. It looks me in the face, and it looks 
with reproachful eyes. 

Mrs. Peverel. There should be no reproach 
for you, Mr. Domville — because you're heroic. 

Guy. We talked of heroism here — when we talked 
of renouncement. 

Mrs. Peverel. But the hour came when against 
renouncement — I lifted my feeble voice. 

Guy. Your voice was sweet to me — and it's sweeter 
than ever now. 

Mrs. Peverel. Yours has a tone, Mr. Domville, 
that's different — that's strange. 

Guy. It sounds strange to myself, believe me, 
when I ask you — to let me plead again — for Frank. 
Take pity on him — don't send him forth from his 
home. 

Mrs. Peverel. You speak for him as if — (Breaking 
down with excess of feeling. Re-enter Frank Hum- 
ber and Lord Devenish.) 

Guy. As if I didn't love you to passion — heaven 
hear me! And as if — heaven hear me! — I hadn't 
come down here to tell you so! 

Frank. Tell her so — tell her so, Guy. And if 
"heaven" doesn't forgive you I'll set heaven an 
example. 

Guy. As if I spoke without an effort and held my 



200 Guy Domville 

peace without a pang? I grant you freely, Madam, 
it wasn't for that, I came. 

Frank. He came on a mighty different business! 

Guy. I came for a good thing, but I shall have 
found occasion for a better, and I think that in all 
the future I shall have an equal joy of both! It is / 
who shall go! 

Lord Devenish. I've consented, sir, to meet you. 

Guy. I'm the last, my lord, of the Domvilles! 
(Then anticipating Devenish's reply and speaking 
on his quick gesture of impatient despair,) You've 
been so good as to take a zealous interest in my 
future — and in that of my family: for which I owe 
you, and now ask you to accept, all thanks. But 
I beg you, still more solemnly, to let that prodigious 
zeal rest, from this moment, for ever! I listened to 
your accents for a day — I followed you where you 
led me. I looked at life as you showed it, and then 
I turned away my face. That's why I stand here 
again; for (with intensely controlled emotion) 
there are other things — there are partings. (Then 
very gently to Mrs. Peverel.) Will my conveyance 
have come back? 

Mrs. Peverel. (Listening an instant, and as if 
subjugated by his returning sanctity.) I think I hear 
it now. 

Guy. Then I start this moment for Bristol. 
(Sadly, kindly smiling.) Father Murray has had 
patience. I go with him to France, to take up my 
work in the Church! if the Church will take again 
an erring son! 

Mrs. Peverel. She'll take him. 

Lord Devenish. And you give him? 

Mrs. Peverel. To her! 

Lord Devenish. (With high sarcasm, to Guy.) 
I hope you do justice to this lady's exemplary sac- 
rifice! 

Guy. (Blank.) Sacrifice? 



Act Third 201 

Lord Devenish. That of a sentiment my con- 
sideration for her forbids me to name. 

Frank. She loves you, Guy! 

Lord Devenish. He doesn't deserve to know it. 
(Then smiling, gallant to Mrs. Peverel.) If it were 
me, Madam! (From the threshold.) Pity me! 

Mrs. Peverel. It was a dream, but the dream is 
past! 

Guy. (Gathering himself slowly from a deep, 
stupefied commotion.) The Church takes me! (To 
Mrs. Peverel.) Be kind to him. (To Frank.) Be 
good to her. (At the door.) Be good to her. 

Frank. Mrs. Peverel — I shall hope! 

Mrs. Peverel. Wait!

Sir Ralph Damant, Bart. 

Mark Bernal, 

Teddy Ash down. 

The Vicar. 

The Footman. 

Grace Jesmond. 

Lady Basset. 

Maud Vanneck. 



ACT FIRST 

The convenient, inhabited hall of a handsome modern country- 
bouse, which exhibits several signs of confusion and disarray, as if 
something has happened to interrupt the regular routine; Up toward 
the left the passage to the outer hall, the entrance to the house, and 
also to some of the apartments. Up toward the right the passage to 
other apartments. Half-way down, to the right, a large French 
window, open to the garden and park. Corresponding to it, to the 
left, the door to the library, constituting another entrance to the house. 

Lady Bassbt enters briskly from the outer ball, in ber bat and mantle, dressed 
for a journey, carrying with her a dressing-bag substantially stuffed. She 
places it on one of the tables ; then bunting about a moment finds a book 
in another part of the room and, bringing it over, proceeds to pack it into 
her bag. While she is so engaged Teddy Ashdown enters from the 
outer hall, in his hat and Inverness cape, likewise carrying a dressing- 
bag. In his other hand he carries a note in an enclosed envelope. He 
stops short an instant, watching Lady Basset. 

TEDDY. 

Is that the second volume ? 

LADY BASSET, serenely packing. 

Dear Maud has it. This is the third. You had better 
take the first. 

TEDDY, coming down, putting his bag on another table. 

Oh, IVe read it ! 



4 THE ALBUM 

LADY BASSET. 

That doesn't matter — it completes the set. 

TEDDY. 

But it deprives the house — ! 

LADY BASSET, her bag in her hand ; now all ready to go. 

The house can afford it, and in this upheaval it's an 
advantage there should be fewer things to lie about. 

TEDDY, artless. 

To "lie ''about? 

LADY BASSET. 

When confusion reigns I take a line. There's not a 
creature anywhere — I carry my own luggage. 

TEDDY, taking his bag again. 

So do I ! 

LADY BASSET, perceiving the note in his hand. 

You also carry the letters ? 

TEDDY, reading again the superscription. 
Till I find the Vicar. (Then handing her the note, quoting.) 

" Very urgent " ! 

LADY BASSET, who has taken the note from him. 

Then why dorit you find the Vicar ? 

TEDDY, putting down his bag again ; very vague. 

I'm looking ! 



. ACT FIRST 5 

LADY BASSET, preoccupied with the note, which she retains. 

Dear Maud has him. 

TEDDY, startled, decided. 

Then I must find dear Maud. 

LADY BASSET. 
VOU WOn^t one never does. (Turning the note over and round.) 

From Mr. Lamb? 

TEDDY, assenting. 

The soHcitor : to be particularly attended to. 

LADY BASSET, with unfaltering decision. 

I'll attend to it. 

TEDDY, surprised. 

You'll read it ? 

LADY BASSET. 

When confusion reigns I take a line. (Then having resolutely 

opened and reading the note) " Sir Ralph wirCS arrival pleaSC 

see that he's met at Junction." '(Struck, thinking.) Sir 
Ralph Damant ? 

TEDDY. 

The next of kin — they've sent for him. 

LADY BASSET, thoughtful ; refolding the note. 

The next of kin? I know — unmarried. I'll see that 
he's met ! (Then determined.) I'll meet him ! 

TEDDY, still more surprised. 

But you go by the other station. 



6 THE ALBUM 

LADY BASSET. 

I don't go. I Stay. 

TEDDY, in suspense. 

And dear Maud ? 

LADY BASSET. 

You'll take her off. 

TEDDY, eager. 

In a moment — if she'll come. 

LADY BASSET. 

But you'll first take my bag. 

TEDDY, with the bag she has again placed on the table. 

Take it— ? 

LADY BASSET. 

Back to my room. 

TEDDY. 

And tell Miss Jesmond ? 

LADY BASSET. 

Miss Jesmond's out. She's heartless. 

TEDDY, blank. 

Heartless ? 

LADY BASSET. 

With her protector, her patron, dying ! 

TEDDY, still more blank. 

Dying ? 



ACT FIRST 7 

LADY BASSET. 

If the nearest of kin is sent for. 

TEDDY, struck ; rucfuL 

What a pity w^re not near ! 

LADY BASSET. 

One is — when one's on the spot IVe been in houses 
before when the head has been taken ill and the guests 
have scattered like frightened sheep. But I hold that 
guests have duties, and IVe always remained at my post. 

(Seeing Maud Vanneck : enter Maud Vannbck from the outer hall, dressed 

also for traveUing.) Mf. Bedford's dying ! 

MAUD, in a waistcoat, with an eye-glass. 

Already ? 

LADY BASSET. 

Before one can turn round. It has taken only a summer 
night to empty the house. 

MAUD. 

It seems to me we fill it a good deal ! But Tve sent 
the Vicar for my bag. 

LADY BASSET. 

You go with Mr. Ashdown. 

MAUD, after an instant. 

And whom do you go with ? 

TEDDY. 

She doesn't go. You and I go together ! 



THE ALBUM 
LADY BASSET. 



I remain — to act. 



TEDDY, to Maud; explaining. 

For poor Mr. Bedford — to receive the heir. 

MAUD, struck. 

Is there an heir ? 

TEDDY, taking his note with quick compunction back from Lady Basset. 

By the way, he must be met ! 

MAUD, surprised, ironic 

By her ladyship ? 

LADY BASSET. 

For common decency. There's no one else ! 

MAUD. 

Isn't there Miss Jesmond ? 

LADY BASSET. 

Miss Jesmond doesn't count. A person in her position 
— a, dependent. 

TEDDY. 

Besides, she's out. 

MAUD. 

Only at the station — hurrying people off. 

LADY BASSET, struck. 
The station ? (Catching Maud's arm and in the inadvertence of her dis- 
composure precipitately betraying herself.) Then shc'll SCe him firSt ! 



ACT FIRST 9 

MAUD, with reproachful superiority. 

Is it your kind calculation that / shall see him last ? 

TEDDY. 

Don't see him at all ! Travel with me I (Then as the Vicar 
aK)ears.) Here's your bag ! 

Enter the Vicar from the outer hall wearing his hat and carrying a 
lady's dressing-bag. 

MAUD. 

Take it back ! (Seating herself with resolution.) I remain. 

TEDDY, seating himself in the same manner. 

Then / remain. 

LADY BASSET, to the Vicar ; abrupt, imperative. 

Take me to the Junction — it's your duty. 

THE VICAR, youngish, bland, blond, flustered. 

There isn't a conveyance — everything's out ! 

MAUD, to Lady Basset. 

If you go there, my dear, / go ! 

TEDDY, to Maud. 
And if you go, I go ! (Then to the Vicar, as Lady Basset turns 
away with a disconcerted shrug.) YoU mUSt gO — tO meet the 

heir! 

THE VICAR. 

Sir Ralph ? he's coming ? 



lo THE ALBUM 

TEDDY. 

This moment. (To get nd of him.) Go quick ! 

LADY BASSET. 

Receive him with all the honours. 

MAUD, laughing. 

Don't mind that — leave the reception to us ! 

THE VICAR, at a loss, with his bag. 

But how shall I get there ? 

TEDDY. 

Catch a pony — ride ! 

THE VICAR, with a happy thought. 

ril run ! 



Exit the Vicar with the bag to the outer hall. 



TEDDY, to Maud, amused. 

He has sneaked your bag ! 

MAUD. 

Recover it — take it back to my room. 

LADY BASSET. 

Do nothing of the sort — take mine. 

TEDDY, with Lady Basset's bag. 

I'll take both ! 



Exit Teddy to the outer hall. 



ACT FIRST II 

MAUD, with dignity and resentment. 

That's not the sort of girl I am ! 

LADY BASSET. 

What sort do you mean ? 

MAUD. 

The sort that goes up to London with unscrupulous 
young men. You interpret strangely your pledge to my 
absent mother. 

LADY BASSET. 

You talk as if your absent mother were in paradise ! 

MAUD. 

She's only at Zanzibar, I know — on her tour round the 
globe. But I'm none the less entitled to your con- 
scientious care. 

LADY BASSET. 

Why then are you so nasty when I endeavour to dis- 
pose of you properly ? 

MAUD. 

Do you call it disposing of me properly to dispose of 
me to Mr. Ashdown ? 

LADY BASSET. 

He's the only person I've met who takes any notice of 
you! 

MAUD. 

You don't meet many people, I know, for every one 
runs away from you ! 



12 THE ALBUM 

LADY BASSET. 

My mother never did, my dear, as yours has done from 

you ! 

MAUD. 

She'll come back as soon as she receives the account 
Fve written her of your selfishness. 

LADY BASSET. 

It doesn't compare with hers, I think ; for I accepted, 
when I rashly consented to take you out, the problem 
she unnaturally shirked ! 

MAUD. 

You took me from cold calculation — you knew I would 
prove attractive. 

LADY BASSET, protesting, derisive. 

Attractive ? 

MAUD. 

To single gentlemen — and others. And then let you 

get hold of them ! (After an instant, with triumphant emphasis.) 

That's not the sort of girl I am ! 

LADY BASSET. 

If I had been aware of the sort you are I never would 
have looked at you ! I cable to Zanzibar that I throw 
you up. 

MAUD. 

You leave me unprotected ? Very well : I can face the 
usual dangers ! 



ACT FIRST 13 

LADY BASSET. 

You seem highly familiar with them ! (Then, after a moment, 

in a different tone, as if with a new, superseding thought.) Can yOU face 

Miss Jesmond ? 

MAUD, blank. 

What danger does she present ? 

LADY BASSET. 

That of producing an early impression on Sir Ralph 
Damant. 

MAUD. 

The gentleman about to arrive ? 

LADY BASSET. 

The nearest of kin, the heir to this lovely Courtlands. 

MAUD. 

How are you sure he's the heir ? 

LADY BASSET. 

Mr. Bedford's to make a new will. Mr. Lamb, his 
solicitor, is with him. 

MAUD. 

To make it in favour of Sir Ralph ? 

LADY BASSET. 

Naturally — if he has called him to his bedside. 

MAUD, thoughtful. 

Yes ; he wouldn't bring him from London only to cut 
him off ! But aren't there other relatives ? 



14 THE ALBUM 

LADY BASSET. 

Far-away kindred — people with means of their own. I 
used to hear of them from my husband. 

MAUD. 

In the improvident days when you had a husband ! 
Has no one else expectations ? 

LADY BASSET. 

Miss Jesmond has plenty, I suppose ! 

MAUD, blank. 

Do you mean he*ll do more for her ? Hasn't she lived 
on him for years ? 

LADY BASSET. 

For the last four or five. She has enjoyed every luxury, 
in return for promiscuous services rendered as an 
" amanuensis " — functions mysterious and elastic ! But 
as the daughter of an old friend — the clergyman who 
was this one's predecessor and who died without leaving 
a farthing — he may think her a deserving object. 

MAUD, after an instant 

Do you mean she'll lie in wait for Sir Ralph ? 

LADY BASSET. 

She's just that kind of person. It's the way she's 
dangerous. Therefore keep an eye on her. 

MAUD, after another instant 

Do you set me to watch her so that you may be free to 
look after Sir Ralph ? 



ACT FIRST 15 

LADY BASSET. 

I give you my reasons for thinking that he may be of 
interest to her. 

MAUD. 

But why should she be of interest to him ? 

LADY BASSET. 

Because she's so pretty and so clever. 

MAUD. 

Has she had the Higher Education ? No ? Then she's 
not a trained intelligence ! 

LADY BASSET. 

I believe it is an intellectual gymnastic to cope with the 
coldness of Sir Ralph ! 

MAUD. 

Is he so exempt from the weaknesses of his sex ? 

LADY BASSET. 

I've never seen him, but I've heard of his peculiar atti- 
tude — the dread of the dizziness of great heights. He 
has a terror of eminent women — the fascination of the 
abyss. It's a fixed idea with him that if he neglects his 
defences he may some day take the jump. 

MAUD. 

Find himself practically engaged ? 

LADY BASSET. 

Find himself legally married. 



i6 THE ALBUM 

\L\UD. 
Are there such a lot of things to marry him for ? 

LADY BASSET. 

Figure them up ! A good old title — a. creation of Eliza- 
beth. A quiet mind about other women. A very good 

fortune, and (with a gesture for the whole place about them) a very 

fine prospect ! 

MAUD. 

If he has money enough to go in fear, why does poor 
Mr. Bedford leave him more ? 

LADY BASSET. 

To increase his terror — a harmless joke of the dear 
man! 

MAUD. 

Do you mean because Mr. Bedford himself has a passion 
for us ? 

LADY BASSET. 

Uncontrolled — but platonic ! Besides, there's no other 
cousin. 

MAUD. 

None at all ? 

.LADY BASSET. 

There was one, I believe, but he's lost to sight. 

MAUD. 

Trust him to turn up ! 



ACT FIRST 17 

LADY BASSET. 

They have trusted him, but always in vain. He was 
wild, he was worthless — good for nothing but America, 
to which he went. 

MAUD. 

If he went he can come back. 

LADY BASSET. 

Not, luckily, from the grave — luckily, I mean, for Sir 
Ralph. Mr. Bedford has knowledge of his death. 

MAUD. 

And have you knowledge of his name ? 

LADY BASSET. 

His name ? Mark Bernal. 

MAUD, after an instant, rising. 

I thank you for your solid facts. Very nice of you ! 

LADY BASSET. 

Haven't I justified my warning about Miss Jesmond ? 

MAUD. 
Perfectly. (After another instant, in the tone of one who has won a diplo- 
matic victory.) Make her your charge ! 

LADY BASSET, blank ; then disconcerted, indignant, rising. 

You're ungrateful — and you're sly I 

Enter Mark Bernal from the outer hall. 
VOL. II C 



iLi^ 



i8 THE ALBUM 

MAUD, seeing him first ; privately. 

Not a bit — see how frank I shall be with Sir Ralph ! 

LADY BASSET, to herself, startled, turning ; taking in Mark Bernal 
with emotion and surprise. 

Sir Ralph ? 

BERNAL, a man of some thiee-and-thirtyi; very good-looking, but of un- 
conventional aspect ; with a long fair moustache, a mixed, informal suit, 
composed of articles that don't match ; a soft hat, a light overcoat over one 
arm and a painter's album, a sketch-book of moderate size — new and covered 
with brown linen— carried in the other : stopping short as he sees the two 
women, looking vaguely from one of them to the other ; then, eagerly, as 
he comes down. 

My cousin's ill ? I heard in the village how grave it is. 

LADY BASSETT, solemnly sympathetic, but intensely gracious 
and reassuring. 

The dear man suffers, but I'm watching ! 

MAUD, with the same effusion of condolence ; very ingratiating. 

The party broke up ; but it seemed to me (smiling signifi- 
candy at Bernal) quite twt th6 moment to tum one's back ! 

LADY BASSET. 

At the door there was no one to receive you ? 

BERNAL. 

It Stood wide open, and, as I rang in vain, I ventured 
at last to walk in. 

MAUD, seductive. 

You needn't have been afraid, with the place as good as 
your own ! 



ACT FIRST 19 

LADY BASSET, irrcsbtiblc. 

You must let me share your authority till the servants 
are again at their posts. 

BERNALr, who has looked, as they alternately address htm, in bewilderment 
and mystification from one of the women to the other. 

My ** authority," madam, is small, and my title to 
possession nil ! 

LADY BASSET. 

You speak from your characteristic reserve ! 

MAUD. 

You'll find your essential strength when youVe seen Mr. 
Bedford 

BERNAL, more and more confounded, but also dawningly amused. 

My essential strength ? 

LADY BASSET, arch. 

You can't evade your fate ! 

BERNAL, blank. 

My fate ? 

LADY BASSET. 

The way to learn it is to let me take you to our honoured 
friend. 

MAUD, eagerly interposing. 

Permit me to recommend your waiting, while this lady 
goes to ask leave. 

BERNAL, hesitating afresh, thinking, looking still, in his guarded wonder* 
ment, from one of them to the other. 

Is his present state very critical ? 



20 THE ALBUM 

LADY BASSET. 

Dear Maud will oblige you by ascertaining. He*s shut 
up at present with his solicitor. 

• MAUD. 
Inevitably, alas, at such a moment, with the future of 
such possessions at stake f 

LADY BASSET. 

Their commanding extent demands the presence of the 
family. 

BERNAL, dazed, echoing. 

The family ? 

LADY BASSET. 

Reduced to you^ happy man, though you pretend you 
don't appreciate it ! 

BERNAL. 

You accuse me of pretending, madam ; but I won't 
pretend I understand you ! (After an instant.) Give me 
time to turn round — Vm painfully affected, (indicating the 
long window.) I'll go out z. moment. 

MAUD, almost pouncing on him. 

Into the air ? I'll take you ! 

LADY BASSET, baffled by Maud's alertness, looking round her quickly and 
spying Bbrnal's album, which he has placed on a table and of which she 
possesses herself. 

I'll take your charming companion ! 

BERNAL, anxious, ingenuous, demurring. 

Then who'll be near my cousin ? 



ACT FIRST 21 

LADY BASSET. 

The vicar, the lawyer, the doctor, the nurse. 

MAUD, wifh a sarcastic inflection. 

And also Miss Grace Jesmond ! 

BERNAL, vague. 

Miss Grace Jesmond ? 

LADY BASSET. 

A person employed. 

MAUD. 

One of the fixtures. 

BERNAL, innocent. 

She goes with the house ? 

LADY BASSET. 

Scarcely to enhance its value ! 

MAUD. 

She has value enough to be paid ! 

BERNAL, vague. 

Paid? 

LADY BASSET. 

Wages. She writes for the dear man, she reads for him, 
and I daresay she ciphers ! 

MAUD, who has possessed herself, officiously, to carry it, of Bernal's light 
overcoat in the same way that Lady Basset has appropriated the sketch-hook. 

But she hasn't had the Higher Education ! 



22 THE ALBUM 

BERNAL, laughing and trying to take his coat back from Maud. 
I haven't had it myself! (Then as she whisks away the coat, 

escaping to the right,) Take care — there are things in the 
pockets ! 

MAUD, victorious, challenging ; in the long window with the coat. 

Then come and get them ! 

Flirts out to the park. 

LADY BASSET, nursing the sketch-book ; sociably, while Bernal, at the 
window, appearing to hesitate, looks at her an instant 

Which of us do you prefer ? 

BERNAL, clapping the empty pockets of his waistcoat and jacket, as if with 
alarm, successively and quickly. 

I prefer my cigarettes ! 

Exit Bernal by the window. 

LADY BASSET, disconcerted, considering. 

Shall I follow with this ? (Opening the album ; turning a page 

or two.) Real art ? my passion ! (Then to herself, as she sees 

Grace Jesmond at the left — enter Grace J Esmond from the library— dropping 
the book on a table as if to disconnect herself from every sign of the visitor's 
passage.) Ah ! 

GRACEj back from the station, in her hat and jacket ; stopping short, surprised 
at still finding Lady Basset, and speaking impulsively. 

You're not gone ? 

LADY BASSET, uncompromising. 

And not going ! 

GRACE, struck, eager. 

Then Mr. Bedford's better ? 



ACT FIRST 23 

LADY BASSET, at the window; vicious. 

Mr. Bedford's worse ! 

Exit Lady Basset to the park. 
GRACE, alone, dolorous, interrogative. 

*' Worse?" 

Enter a Footman from the outer hall. 
FOOTMAN. 

Sir Ralph Damant ! 

Enter Sir Ralph Damant. Exit Footman. 
GRACE, instantly, sadly.' 

Mr. Bedford's worse ! 

SIR RALPH, stopping short with the force of his contained emotion. 
Ah ? (Then, after an instant, while he has stood with lowered eyes.) How 

much worse? 

GRACE. 

Even a little (thinking, discouraged) may be more than 
enough ! 

SIR RALPH. 

How lately have you seen him ? 

GRACE. 
Not this morning. I've been at the station — seeing 
people off. 

SIR RALPH. 

He has had " people " again ? , 



24 THE ALBUM 

GRACE. 
A large party. 

SIR RALPH. 

Women, as usual ? 

GRACE. 

Several ladies. 

SIR RALPH. 

They've all gone ? 

GRACE. 

Not quite all. 

SIR RALPH. 

All but you ? . 

GRACE. 
I don't go (after an instant, with the note of quiet irony) qulte yCt. 

And two others remain. 

SIR RALPH, with a slight start and a glance round him. 

Two Others ? Where are they ? 

GRACE, nodding toward the window. 

I think in the park. 

SIR RALPH, peremptory. 

Then send them off! 

GRACE, cold. 

I'll leave you to do that. 

SIR RALPH. 

Fve more immediate duties — I've been sent for. 



ACT FIRST 25 

GRACE. 
So I heard — before going out. 

SIR RALPH. 

You range the country — with poor Mr. Bedford dying ? 

GRACE, after an instant. 

I've not said that he's dying. 

SIR RALPH, perceptibly pulled up. 

Then, pray, why was I dragged here ? 

GRACE. 
I had nothing to do with dragging you. His doctor's 
with him — and his clergyman. And Mr. Lamb, his 
lawyer. 

SIR RALPH, after a moment. 

For testamentary purposes ? 

GRACE. 

Very likely. It was Mr. Lamb's idea to wire to you. 

SIR RALPH. 

What does he want me to do ? 

GRACE. 

I haven't the least idea. 

SIR RALPH. 

He shouldn't trifle (hesitating) with my habits ! I've not 
been here for years. 



26 THE ALBUM 

GRACE. 
Just five. Your last visit was the year I came. 

SIR RALPH. 

There have always been too many women. 

GRACE. 

Fve had the misfortune to be one of them. 

SIR RALPH. 

"One" is quite enough. In some cases, indeed, too 
much. I recognise — in general — your inevitable char- 
acter, but I hate to be the subject of manoeuvres. 

GRACE. 

It must be very odious. It has never been my fate. 

SIR RALPH. 

I can easily believe it. Keep out of them ! 

GRACE. 

We can each — for ourselves — abstain from them. 

SIR RALPH, looking at her hard an instant. 

That's exactly what I do ! I neither practise nor permit 

them. (Then after another instant, during which Grace gives a silent, 
decorous, but inexpressive movement of assent.) Have Other relations 

been summoned? 

GRACE. 
Others ? I think there are no others. 



ACT FIRST 27 

SIR RALPH, gratified, complacent. 

Only me ? There are persons remotely connected, but 
I appreciate the discrimination. 

GRACE. 

Mr. Lamb, last night, asked me a question. 

SIR RALPH. 

In regard to your personal pretensions ? 

GRACE, surprised. 
Mine ? (With genuine melancholy dignity.) What pretensionS 

have 7, Sir Ralph ? 

SIR RALPH. 

You're the sort of person who usually has extraordinary 

ones ! 

GRACE. 

How do you know what sort of person I am ? 

SIR RALPH. 

I admit that IVe been reduced to speculate. (After an 

instant, somewhat tentatively.) FvC WOUdercd, for inStaUCC, if 

you're paid. 

GRACE. 
For my work ? 

SIR RALPH. 

Or have only your bed and board. 

GRACE. 

And my washing? Let me relieve you. IVe had a 
salary. 



28 THE ALBUM 

SIR RALPH, relieved. 

Ah, that settles the question ! 

GRACE, vague. 

What question ? 

SIR RALPH. 

That of your expectations. You took them out in his 
life. 

GRACE. 

You speak as if his life were over ! 

SIR RALPH. 

An inadvertence. But from the moment the lawyers 
take the field — ! 

GRACE. 

It was to ask me about Mark Bernal. 

SIR RALPH, struck; vague an instant. 

Mark Bernal ? 

GRACE. 

Who was mentioned in an earlier will. 

SIR RALPH, thinking. 

Little Mark, shabby little Mark — whom I knew as a boy, 
a small boy when I was a big one : my cousin's cousin 

and my own cousin ? (With extreme emphasis and decision.) Why, 

all the world knows he's dead. 

GRACE. 

Mr. Lamb's aware of that rumour. 



ACT FIRST 29 

SIR RALPH. 
It ain't a rumour — it's a fact ! 

GRACE. 

Requiring proof. There are four thousand a year — 

SIR RALPH, breaking in. 

Four thousand a year ? 

GRACE. 

For somebody ! 

SIR RALPH, Vter an instant. 

Not for shabby little Mark ! 

GRACE. 

So it would appear. Mr. Bedford, last night, was not to 
be disturbed; so that Mr. Lamb's question was as to 
whether, during the five years I've lived here, I had 
heard of any communication from Mr. BernaL 

SIR RALPH, complacently affirmative. 

And you've heard of none ! 

GRACE. 

None whatever. 

SIR RALPH. 

Then that's the proof required. Mark's mother was a 
cousin of our cousin — that's the degree. 

GRACE. 

The same degree as your degree. 



30 THE ALBUM 

SIR RALPH, after an instant, as if reluctant to admit it. 
The same degree as mine. (Then with much more alacrity.) But 

a connection — undesirable. They were people of no 
position. 

GRACE, ironically dubious, surprised. 

Cousins of yours ? 

SIR RALPH, totally unconscious of her irony : candidly confidential. 

I never ran after them. The mother died, the father 
died, and Mark, who used to come here for his holidays, 
made a sad mess of his prospects. 

GRACE. 

Prospects ? What prospects ? 

SIR RALPH. 

A presumptive interest in the four thousand. He took 
to low courses ; I believe he took to painting portraits. 
He wore queer clothes and knew queer people. He 
was wild — I'm convinced he was wicked. His tastes 
were vulgar ; his abilities mean. He went tt) the bottom 
— he went to America. 

GRACE. 

Where — in the far west — he died, in a brawl, unap- 
preciated. 

SIR RALPH. 

But not uncommemorated. (After an instant.) The papers 
mentioned it. 



ACT FIRST 31 

GRACE. 
And if they hadn't ? 

SIR RALPH, pointing judiciously the moral. 

Why, he might have come in for something ! 

GRACE, turning away with a vague general sigh. 

It makes one hate them ! (Then seeing the Vicar, and addressing 
him, introducing Sir Ralph. Re-enter the Vicar from the outer hall, heated 
and breathless, still with Maud Vanneck's bag.) Sir Ralph Damant. 

THE VICAR. 

I missed you by crossing the fields ! 

SIR RALPH, distant, sarcastic, superior. 

I'm never to be found in the " fields " ! 

GRACE. 

Will you kindly inform Mr. Lamb ? 

THE VICAR. 

And what shall I do with the bag ? 

GRACE, amused, indicating indulgently a place to put it down. 

Part with it — there ! 

THE VICAR, depositing the bag with scrupulous care and extreme relief. 

There ! (Then up at the right.) I'll announce Sir Ralph. 

Exit the Vicar to the right. 
Re«enter from the outer hall Teddy Ashdown. 



32 THE ALBUM 

TEDDY, seeing the bag. 
He's back with it ? (Confidingly, familiarly, to both the others.) 

Such a chase ! 

SIR RALPH, struck with the elation of his tone and regarding the bag — 
conspicuously and showily a lady's — with cold suspicion. 

Pray, sir, is it yours ? 

GRACE. 

It belongs to Miss VannecL 

SIR RALPH. 

And who on earth's Miss Vanneck ? 

GRACE, up at the door to the outer hall, to Teddy. 

Your friends are in the park. Instruct Sir Ralph while 
I see about his room. 

Exit Grace Jesmond. 

TEDDY, artless, guileless ; producing his effects on Sir Ralph 
without intention. 

Fearfully clever girl, Miss Vanneck; she's had the 
Higher Education. 

SIR RALPH. 
Mercy ! 

TEDDY. 

A trained intelligence. She came with Lady Basset. 

SIR RALPH. 

And who on earth's Lady Basset ? 

TEDDY. 

Awfully sharp too. She's waiting for you. 



ACT FIRST 33 

SIR RALPH, dismayed. 

Waiting for me ? 

TEDDY. 

She was going ; but she stayed. 

SIR RALPH, echoing. 

Stayed ? 

TEDDY. 

On purpose to meet you. She knows you're the Heir ! 

SIR RALPH. 

Good God, Fm not the Heir ! 

TEDDY, surprised. 

You're not ? 

SIR RALPH. 

I am ; but it's none of her business 1 

TEDDY, innocently disconcerted. 

Mayn't I tell her, then ? 

SIR RALPH. 

Don't dream of it ! Be so good as to remain with me. 

TEDDY, who has gone to the long window. 

I was thinking of joining " dear Maud " ! 

SIR RALPH. 

The trained intelligence ? (As if with a hopeful thought.) Are 
you in love with it ? 

VOL. II D 



34 THE ALBUM 

TEDDY. 
I suppose that's what's the matter with me ! 

SIR RALPH. 

Then marry the creature ! 

TEDDY. 

She won't look at me ; she wants a decent fortune. 

SIR RALPH, after an instant. 

What does she call a decent fortune ? 

TEDDY. 

Four thousand a year. 

SIR RALPH, dismayed again. 

Four thousand ? 

TEDDY. 

She has fixed that figure. Of course I'm stone broke. 
My governor has stopped payment. 

SIR RALPH. 

Then make an effort — find something to do. 

TEDDY. 

That's exactly what I'm looking for ! 

SIR RALPH. 

Continue to look look hard ! (Then, as Tfddy seems restless.) 

And whatever you do, stay here ! (Encouraging, reassuring.) 
Sit down amuse yourself! (Looking round, nervously, for pretexts 



ACT FIRST 35 

for detaining, beguiling him, Sir Ralph's eye falls on Mark Bbrnal's album, 
which Lady Basset has placed on one of the tables and which he takes up.) 

I see you sketch. 

TED0Y, seated. 

Oh yes ; Fve the artistic nature. 

SIR RALPH 

Fall back on it ! 

TEDDY. 

I am falling ! I feel IVe a little gift that only requires 
direction. 

SIR RALPH. 
Then direct it ! (Turning over two or three pages of the album; 
patronisingly, commendingly.) I like the Steam-rollcr ! 

TEDDY, vague. 

What steam-roller ? 

SIR RALPH, passing him the open book. 

That one. 

TEDDY, with the album. 

It's not mine. (Looking at the cover.) It's awfully Hkc mine ! 

(Then on his feet again.) It beloUgS (turning to the flyleaf and reading) 

to " Mark Bernal" 

SIR RALPH, immensely startled. 

Mark Bernal ? 

TEDDY, unconscious of his start, continuing to read from the page. 

"Mark Bernal, Vandyke Lodge, Chelsea; September 

'91." (Then glancing again at the outside of the album.) A joUy 

new book. 



36 THE ALBUM 

SIR RALPH, taking it back from Teddy's hand and repeating, in his 
guarded amazement,' interrogatively, but mechanically. 

A jolly new book ? 

TEDDY. 

Dated last month. Who is Mark Bernal ? 

SIR RALPH, who has stared hard a moment at the name on the flyleaf, 
and then, looking up, presented a pale, alarmed, conjectural face. 

I haven't the least idea ! 

TEDDY, to whom, recovering himself with a great effort, and as if it doesn't 
matter or mean anything to him, he has surrendered the album again. 

Somebody has left it. (Then reverting to the drawing of which Sir 

Ralph has spoken.) By Jovc, I'll co/y the Steamroller ! 

SIR RALPH, uneasy, as Teddy, with the album under his arm, 
goes to the long window. 

Where are you going ? 

TEDDY. 

To join the ladies ! 

Exit Teddy Ashdown, with the album, to the park. 
SIR RALPH, alone, deeply agitated, wonderstruck. 

Mark Bernal — last month ? Here, and nobody knows ? 

(Then, to himself, seeing the Vicar reappear: re-enter the Vicar from the 
right.) Will ^ know ? (To the Vicar, eager.) My COUSin's 

worse ? 

THE VICAR, with a memorandum in his hand. 

He keeps up — for Mr. Lamb — but the doctor deprecates 
his seeing you. Therefore I'm desired by Mr. Lamb 
to put you an important question. 



^, 



ACT FIRST 37 

SIR RALPH, nervous, anxious. 

An important question ? 

THE VICAR, highly responsible and a little embarrassed. 

Confided to my discretion— on the subject of a relative. 

SIR RALPH, more guarded. 

A relative ? 

THE VICAR, who has again consulted his memoraiidum ; looking at Sir 
Ralph, while his pencil taps his chin, over his glasses. 

Mr. Mark Moorsom Bernal. 

SIR RALPH, silent, motionless a moment ; then, with intensely studi'jd 
collectedness, while he sees Grace J Esmond reappear. 

What of Mr. Mark Moorsom Bernal ? 

Re-enter, as he speaks, Grace Jesmond from the outer hall, with several open 
letters in her hand. 

THE VICAR. 

He's believed not to be living. 

SIR RALPH, while Gkacr, who on recognising the manner in which ihey 
are engaged, has first stopped short and then, on reflection, come down 
discreetly on the side of the stage opposite Sir Ralph's and remained 
there effacing herself and waiting ; only looking over her letters. 



BeHeved — universally 



THE VICAR, referring again to his paper. 

Mr. Bedford has taken it for granted ! But it has 
occurred to him, for his completer satisfaction, to cause 
it to be inquired of you, while he has still power to 
inquire, if any intimation to the contrary — (Pausing scmpu- 

lously an instant, smiling bland'y. explanatorily at Grace.) 



38 THE ALBUM 

SIR RALPH. 

If any intimation to the contrary — ? 

THE VICAR. 

Has lately reached your ears. 



SIR RALPH, after a moment, during which his eyes have met Grace's, 
raised from her letters fixedly to his own in consequence of the Vicar's 
invitation to her. 

No intimation to the contrary has ever reached my ears. 



THE VICAR, appreciative, satisfied, folding up his paper. 
Most definite ; thank you. (Then to Grace, sentimentally, pro- 
fessionally.) Awfully sad ! 

GRACE, grave. 

Awfully ! (Then to Sir Ralph.) I came back to tell you 
that your apartment is ready for you — the King's Room, 
as we call it. As I've pressing letters to answer (indicating 
the library) perhaps the Vicar will kindly take you to it. 



SIR RALPH, reluctant to leave the room and with an uneasy movement 
looking covertly about him as if still preoccupied with the rapid disappear- 
ance, the whereabouts, of the album. 

I won't trouble the Vicar. I remember the King's Room. 



THE VICAR, up at the right, obliging, punctilious. 

Off the main gallery — three steps ! 

Exit the Vicar to the right. 
Re-enter Lady Basset by the long window. 



ACT FIRST 39 

GRACE, at the door of the library. 

I leave you then to Lady Basset ! 

Exit GsACB to the library. 
LADY BASSET, breathless. 

Mr. Ashdown has just told me it's you who are Sir 
Ralph ! 

SIR RALPH, staring, unapproachable. 

Pray who else should it be ? 

LADY BASSET, as if with relief and rapture. 

1 like you the better of the two ! 

SIR RALPH, blank. 

Of which two ? 

LADY BASSET. 

Why, there's a gentleman passing for you ! 

SIR RALPH, aghast. 

Passing for me ? 

LADY BASSET. 

Passing for the Heir — it's the same thing ! 

SIR RALPH, after an instant. 

Possibly ! (After another instant.) Where is this gentleman ? 

LADY BASSET. 

You must ask Miss Vanneck ; she has designs on him. 

SIR RALPH. 

Designs ? 



40 THE ALBUM 

LADY BASSET. 

Matrimonial. Fancy her crudity ! 

SIR RALPH. 
I can easily fancy it ! But if he isn't me, who may this 
person be ? 

LADY BASSET. 

Ask the man ! It's enough for me that you are you ! 

SIR RALPH. 
It's enough for you, madam ; but it's sometimes too 
much for myself! Your news is not agreeable to me, 
and I beg you to permit me to retire. 

LADY BASSET. 
You're going to your room? Allow me to show you 
the way ! 

SIR RALPH. 
I know the way. (Then to settle the matter— keep her quiet.) Off 

the main gallery — three steps. 

LADY BASSET, delighted. 

Three steps ? So is mine ! I'm going to mine. 

SIR RALPH, after an instant. 

Then 1 remain. When did this scoundrel arrive ? 

LADY BASSET. 

But a moment, I judge, before yourself. 



ACT FIRST 41 

SIR RALPH. 
And who else has seen him ? 

LADY BASSET. 

No one but Miss Vanneck. 

SIR RALPH. 

Not Miss Jesmond? 

LADY BASSET. 

Not Miss Jesmond. She^s remiss ! 

SIR RALPH, looking at his watch. 

What's his appearance ? 

LADY BASSET. 

Very fine, I'm bound to confess. (Then significantly.) But 
yoii can hold your own, Sir Ralph ! 

SIR RALPH. 
I pass my life, madam, in trying to ! Is this interloper 
plausible — ^artful ? 

LADY BASSET, after an instant. 

Artful — ^in a sense. He cultivates art ! 

SIR RALPH, struck. 

He draws — he paints ? 

LADY BASSET. 

In a style of his own. He had an album. (Looking about 
her.) It was here. 



42 THE ALBUM 

SIR RALPH, precipitate. 
I haven't seen it ! (Then after a moment's intense and troubled 
thought ; breaking out frankly and abruptly.) Will yOU grant me 3L 

favour, madam? 

LADY BASSET, radiant. 

Every favour a woman can ! 

SIR RALPH. 

One is enough. Simply not to mention that Tve asked 
you these questions. 

LADY BASSET, struck, diplomatic, considering. 

Not to "mention" it? 

SIR RALPH. 

To forget our conversation. 

LADY BASSET. 
That will surely be difficult ! (Then after reflection.) What 

do you offer me for this failure of memory ? 

SIR RALPH. 

" Offer " you ? My gratitude, madam — my enlightened 
esteem. 

LADY BASSET. 

" Esteem," Sir Ralph, is rather cold. The price of dis- 
cretion is always high. (Then, smiling, as he appears to demur.) 

A woman's silence, you know, comes dear ! 



ACT FIRST 43 

SIR RALPH. 

There's nothing in life so expensive. Therefore I don't 
haggle with you. I extend to you my personal regard. 

LADY BASSET, arch. 

How " personal " are you prepared to make it ? 

SIR RALPH, after a moment. 

My opportunities shall show you. 

LADY BASSET. 

I await the demonstration ! 

SIR RALPH. 

On the distinct understanding — ? 

LADY BASSET. 

It's (oiyou to treat it as one ! 

SIR RALPH, at the door to the outer hall as that of the library opens. 

Then I begin. Silence to /i^r/ 

Exit Sir Ralph rapidly. Re-enter Grace Jbsmond from the library. 

LADY BASSET, disconcerted, blank. 

Does he call that " beginning " ? (Then in a totally diflferent tone 
to Gracb, who has two sealed and stamped letters which she takes straight up 

to the big letter-box of the house.) Sir Ralph's adorable ! 

GRACE, after an instant, as she posts her letters. 

Adorable ! 

LADY BASSET. 

And Mr. Bedford ? 



44 THE ALBUM 

GRACE, coming down. 

He keeps up. 

LADY BASSET, with a shade of disappointment. 

No alteration ? 

GRACE. 

None whatever. 

LADY BASSET, after an instant. 

When it comes, please let me know. 

Exit Lady Basset to the outer hall. 
Re-enter Tbddy Ashoown, with the album, by the long window. 
GRACE, kind, as she sees the album. 

Have you been sketching? 

TEDDY, discouraged. 

Fve been looking for " dear Maud " ! 

GRACE. 
All in vain ? 

TEDDY. 

High and low. IVe no heart for the steam-roller ! 

GRACE, vague. 

The steam-roller? 

TEDDY, holding out the album, which Grace takes. 

There's one in there. You should send it after him. 



After whom ? 
Mark Bernal. 
Mark Bernal? 



ACT FIRST 
GRACE. 

TEDDY. 

GRACE, blank. 



AS 



TEDDY. 
There's his address. (Then as he perceives her surprise.) He 

hasn't been here ? 

GRACE, who has opened the book and turned to the flyleaf; staring, 
astounded, at the inscription. 

Been here ? He's dead ! 



TEDDY, bewildered. 



"Dead?" 



GRACE, with all her mystification, but a dawning relief and pleasure 
almost a cry of exultation. 

He's alive ! (Then as she rapidly turns the book over.) Where did 

you get this ? 

TEDDY. 
From Sir Ralph Damant. 



GRACE, struck. 



Sir Ralph Damant? 



TEDDY, increasingly surprised at her emotion, at the importance she 
appears to attach to the circumstance. 

He gave it to me. (indicating the table.) He picked it up 
there. 



46 THE ALBUM 

GRACE, staring. 

There ? How did it come there ? 

TEDDY. 

Blessed if I know ! No more did he, 

GRACE. 

Did he see this name ? 

TEDDY. 

I read it out — I showed it to him. 
GRACE. 

And what did he say ? 

TEDDY. 

He said he didn't know the person. 

GRACE, after a moment. 

How long ago was this ? 

TEDDY, looking at his watch. 

Before I went out — half an hour. 

GRACE. 

Are you certain ? 

TEDDY. 

Certain ! I noticed the clock. 

GRACE, who has stood a moment intensely wondering and thinking, then has 
gone up impulsively to the right with the album and, checking herself, come 
down again. 



Can you keep the secret ? 



ACT FIRST 47 

TEDDY. 
Is it a secret ? 

GRACE. 

Make it one ! Tell no one you've seen this. 

TEDDY. 

But Sir Ralph knows I have. 

GRACE. 

And you know he has. That*s why I want you to be 
dumb. 

TEDDY, staring. 

But if he speaks ? 

GRACE. 

He won't speak ! 

TEDDY. 

Then /won't! 

GRACE. 
Thank you ! (Then, while Mark Bbrnal, unseen by either, reappears : 
re-enter Mark Bbrnal by the long window.) NoW gO tO MisS 

Vanneck ! 

BERNAL, smiling, coming down. 

You'll find her beyond the village, sketching the old 

mill ! (Then while the others, startled, stare at him interrogatively, he goes 
on, after an inclination to Grace, soothingly and sociably.) I pOSted her 

there with a block and a pencil 

TEDDY, precipitate. 

Then Pll join her ! 



Exit Tbddy by the long window. 



48 THE ALBUM 

BERNAL. Ihuikly, amicably. 

I see you have my album ; but I had fortunately in my 
overcoat pocket another string to my bow ! 

GRACE, after a moment, breathless, amazed. 

Are you Mark Moorsom Bemal ? 

BERNAL, assenting, smiling. 

hx^you Grace Jesmond? 

GRACE, surinised, touched. 

What do you know of Grace Jesmond, Mr. Bemal ? 

BERNAL. 
What those ladies, what my brilliant pupil out there, 
have been so good as to tell me. 

GRACE. 

You've seen them — ^you've had time to talk with them ? 

BERNAL. 

They received me when I came. 

GRACE. 
And when on earth did you come — and whence ? 

BERNAL. 

From London — an hour ago. To find a troubled 
house I 

GRACE. 

Mr. Bedford's very ill — and unaware of your presence. 



ACT FIRST 
BERNAL. 

I've been taken for some one else ! 

GRACE. 

Sir Ralph Damant? He has just arrived. 

BERNAL. 

Will he see me ? 

GRACE, after an instant. 

It would surprise him to do so ! He thinks yoi 
dead. 

BERNAL, struck, smiling, penitent. 

That's one for my bad manners ! 

GRACE, kind, impulsive. 

Your manners seem good enough ! (Then after an inst 
But you must save your inheritance.

Ah, Miss Jesmond, I didn't come to life for fkaf !

I Didn't, you know of your chance ?

BERNAL. 
Know of it ? I don't even understand it ! 

GRACE. 
Surely you're aware of the fewness of your relatives. 

BERNAL. 

IVe been conscious mainly of a different order of priva- 
tion ! 

GRACE. 
The only person interested, as they say, is Sir Ralph. 

BERNAL. 

And you, Miss Jesmond — are you not interested ? 

GRACE, surprised. 

I, Mr. Bernal ? (Then after an instant.) I'm a Servant ! 

BERNAL. 

A servant ? 

GRACE. 

I mean that Fve done my work and had my wage. And 
in that useful capacity, by your leave, I should announce 
your arrival to Mr. Bedford. 

BERNAL, demurring. 

Let him learn it, please, at his convenience. 

GRACE. 
Do you think nothing of your own ? 



ACT FIRST 51 

BERNAL, vague. 



My own ? 

GRACE. 

With his weakness — time presses. 



BERNAL. 

If he's so weak, why worry him? Tve neglected him 
too long to have rights. 

GRACE. 
I happen to know that he has had your rights in mind. 

BERNAL. 

Then he'll leave me something ! 

GRACE. 

Unfortunately he supposes that they've lapsed. But 
from the moment that lapse is repaired — 

BERNAL, breaking in. 

He'll "remember" me, as they say? I don't want to 
be remembered as a beggar ! 

GRACE. 
You're no more a beggar than others ! 

BERNAL, vague. 

What others ? 

GRACE. 

There are people who are not here for sentiment 



52 THE ALBUM 

BERNAL. 
You take a kind view of me, Miss Jesmond. 

GRACE, after an instant; fnnk. 

I want you not to be sacrificed. 

BERNAL. 

It would convey a startling suggestion of my being good 
for something ! I smoke pretty much everywhere, but 
I've never smoked on the altar ! 

GRACE. 

If you're not serious now, I'm afraid you'll never be I 

BERNAL, sympathetic, emphatic. 

Yes — on the day I can do something to contribute to 
your interests ! Please believe that I'm deeply touched 
by the attention you give to mine. 

GRACE, after an instant, taking again from a table the album which at the 
beginning of the scene she has laid on it. 

Do you know how to acknowledge it ? (Then as he stares 
while she holds up the book.) By giving me this. 

BERNAL, blank. 

" Giving " it to you ? 

GRACE. 

Letting me keep it. 

BERNAL, assenting with mystified amusement. 

For all it's worth ' 



ACT FIRST 53 

GRACE. 

We'll see what it's worth. (Then moving to go.) But every 
moment counts. 

BERNAL. 

Because he's failing ? 

GRACE. 
He shatit fail ! 

BERNAL. 

If the shock may hurt him, I decline the responsibility I 

GRACE, at the door to the right. 

Then I'll take it! 

Exit Gracb with the album. 
BERNAL, alone. 

What an interesting crisis — and what an attractive 
woman ! 

Re-enter Sir Ralph Damant from the outer hall, precipitate, headlong in his 
discomposure. 

SIR RALPH, with an agitated grievance that breaks out, beyond any other 
preoccupation, to the first person he sees. 

Is there no place in the house that's safe from her? 

BERNAL, vague. 

From Miss Jesmond ? 

SIR RALPH. 

From Lady Basset ! (Then startled, with a wild stare.) Hcavens ! 
are you Mark Bernal ? 

BERNAL, smiling. 

Did you know I was here ? 



54 THE ALBUM 

SIR RALPH. 
Never in the world ! But your face comes back to me. 

BERNAL. 

I thought you thought I was dead. 

SIR RALPH. 

You played the part so well ! 

BERNAL. 

I indeed forgot the " house " ! But I now feel as if I 
were making my bow to it — though Vm not wholly sure 

Fve had a call ! (Then after another look at Sir Ralph.) YoU 

don't look, cousin, as if the call had come from you / 

SIR RALPH. 

Fm not fond of theatricals : I go in for the real thing. 
Why have we been elaborately deceived ? 

BERNAL. • 

Because that was the scale of your credulity ! I did 
engage, at Portland, Oregon, in a silly row, from an 
honourable motive, a motive with a funny accent, but 
with lovely appealing eyes. I interfered, in other words, 
in a domestic discussion, in the settlement of which I 
was left for dead on the field. 

SIR RALPH. 

It served you right ; you interfered on the wrong side ! 



ACT FIRST 55 

BERNAL. 
That was the opinion of the lively local press, which, in 
huge headlines, pointed the moral of my error. It 
therefore remained silent when I at last picked myself 
up, for my recovery was a different reading of the lesson. 

SIR RALPH. 

You might have given us a sign ! 

BERNAL. 

A sign of what ? That I was an ass ? You had let me 
suspect you knew it already ! 

SIR RALPH. 

Yet you've faced us to-day. 

BERNAL. 

It has taken me a month — since my return — to make 
up my mind to it ! 

SIR RALPH. 

You brought tack a fortune ? 

BERNAL. 

Of exactly five pounds ! 

SIR RALPH. 

Don't you practise your trade ? 

BERNAL. 

Of which of my trades do you speak ? I've tried too 
many — I've wasted my time ! 



56 THE ALBUM 

SIR RALPH. 

YouVe been dissolute ? 

BERNAL. 

I've been universal ! 

SIR RALPH. 

Then you're not a painter ? 

BERNAL. 

The critics say so ; but I can't afford to believe them. 
I've returned to my early faith ! 

SIR RALPH. 

Taking portraits ? 

BERNAL, amused. 

At so much a head ! 

SIR RALPH. 

How much ? 

BERNAL, looking at him an instant ; then jocular. 

A thousand pounds ! (Sir Ralph gives a gesture of solemn dismay, 
and at the same moment Bernal sees Maud Vannbck. Re-enter Maud Van- 
neck by the long window ; on which Bernal continues, indicating her sociably.) 

My portraits are dear, but Miss Vanneck can tell you for 
how little I give lessons ! 

MAUD, to Bernal, coming down eagerly. 

Introduce me ! 



ACT FIRST 57 

SIR RALPH, still more peremptory. 



Don^t ! 



BERNAL, with a humorous want of mercy and the gesture of presenting. 

Sir Ralph Damant — my favourite pupil ! 

MAUD, arch and engaging, to Sir Ralph. 

If he's nothing but a drawing-master, you must forgive 
my mistaking him at first for you ! 

BERNAL. 

Now that your error is righted, I expect to be completely 
neglected ! 

SIR RALPH, much disconcerted and disgusted, turning his back on Maud. 

You should keep your favourites in hand ! (Then seeing 

Lady Basset : re-enter Lady Basset from the outer hall.) Ain't shc a 

favourite too ? For God's sake keep ?ier ! 

LADY BASSET, who has removed her hat and exchanged her travelling- 
dress for something very smart and advantageous ; smiling significantly at 
Sir Ralph. 

You see IVe taken off my things ! 

MAUD, presenting, with an undiscouraged smile, the sleeve of her jacket to 
Sir Ralph. 

Sir Ralph himself will kindly take off mine ! 

Sir Ralph makes a gesture of incorruptible austerity, and Teddy Ashdown, at 
the moment Maud speaks, re-enters by the long window. 

TEDDY, rushing forward, xissLsting Maud. 

I say — that's my privilege ! 



58 THE ALBUM 

MAUD, provoked at Sir Ralph and in her petulance thrusting at Teddy a 
long pin taken from her dress. 

Then keep this pin ! 

TEDDY, wounded by the pin and giving a start, a sharp cry while Grace 
Jbsmond reappears. 

Aie! 

Re-enter Gracb Jesmond from the right. 
GRACE, on one side of the stage while Bbrnal is on the other. 

IVe been with the Doctor, Mr. Bernal. (Then, after an 

instant, grave, as the Vicar reappears : re-enter the Vicar from the right.) 

He sends the Vicar with a request. 

THE VICAR, flurried and formal as before, addressing them all. 

I request your indulgence for my errand. The Doctor 
considers that a high standard of tranquillity has not 
been successfully maintained. 

BERNAL, solicitous, precipitate. 

Of course we're an awful nuisance — do tell him I'll go 
this moment ! 

GRACE, promptly interposing. 

Mr. Bernal — please remain ! 

THE VICAR. 

We must part — reluctantly! — with those whoVe so 
conscientiously — 

GRACE, helping him out. 

Misconceived their duty. Lady Basset and Miss Van- 
neck will find a carriage at the door. 



ACT FIRST 59 

LADY BASSET, deeply disconcerted and disgusted, looks resentfully from 
Grack J ESMOND to the Vicar ; then with the movement of accepting under 
compulsion an odious necessity, turns expressively to Sir Ralph. 

We're separated by violence — but I return to take leave 
of you ! 

Exit Lady Bassst to the outer hall. 
MAUD, playfully, to Sir Ralph. 

Not even violence, if a single word — 

SIR RALPH. 

A single word ? Farewell ! 

MAUD, in the same way. 

Ah, that ts violence ! 

TEDDY, with frank alacrity, to Grace. 

I'll also go in the carriage. 

GRACE. 

A moment, Mr. Ashdown. (Then alter an instant.) Sir 
Ralph, can we part with Mr. Ashdown ? 



SIR RALPH, struck and surprised, mystified and alarmed by her tone ; but 
presently replying with an impenetrable face. 

If I may answer for myself — without a pang ! 



GRACE, kind, to Tkddv. 

See to your things then, and coriie back and take leave 
of us ! 



6o THE ALBUM 

TEDDY, who has been admiring Maud's sketching-block, looking sociably 
at Bbrnau 

I hate to take leave of Mr. Bemal, because I want him 
to give me a lesson. 

BERNAL, vague, good-humoured. 

A lesson ? 

TEDDY. 

In Miss Vanneck's class 1 

BERNAL, assenting amicably ; amused. 

Look me up in town. 

TEDDY, highly pleased. 

In town ! 

Exit Teddy to the outer hall with the sketching-block. 
THE VICAR. 

The Doctor consents that Sir Ralph and Mr. Bernal 
shall each see his patient 

SIR RALPH, taking instant precedence. 

Then I go ! 

GRACE, arresting him. 

A moment, Sir Ralph ! (To bernal.) Mr. Bernal, you go 

first. (Then as Bernal hesitates, indicating Sir Ralph's prior right.) Fvc 

something to say to Sir Ralph. 

THE VICAR, to Bernal at the door to the right. 

This way ! 

BERNAL, to Grace, grave, hesitating. 

Will he know me ? 



ACT FIRST 6i 

GRACE. 
Try! 

BERNAL, at the door to the right ; his eyes on her with the same seriousness. 

I'll try ! 

Exeunt Mark Bbrnal and the Vicar. 
GRACE, after an instant. 

The will's made ! 

SIR RALPH, staring. 

Then what's the use of Mark's going ? 

GRACE. 

It's not too late to make another. 

SIR RALPH. 

He'll hold out? 

GRACE. 

The Doctor hopes so — with the sight of Mr. Bernal. 

SIR RALPH. 

Sufficiently to make the effort — ? 

GRACE. 

After a rest — ^to-morrow. 

SIR RALPH, stupefied ; artless. 

He'll live till to-morrow ? 

GRACE. 

Possibly much longer — with care. There must of course 
be no drawback. 



62 THE ALBUM 

SIR RALPH. 
Won't it be a drawback to see Mark ? 

GRACE. 

It will be a great joy. The drawback will be the sense 
of his mistake. 

SIR RALPH, as if vague. 

His mistake ? 

GRACE. 
His failure — an hour ago — to be aware that, at the very 
moment he consented to accept as certified the death of 
a possible legatee, that legatee, by the most extraordi- 
nary of chances, had passed through his house and 
might, but for a fatality, have stood beside his bed ! 

SIR RALPH. 
A fatality ? 

GRACE. 

That of his having escaped observation. 

SIR RALPH, conscious, but very emphatic. 

Completely ! 

GRACE. 

And left no sign of his presence. 

SIR RALPH, with the same serene assurance. 
None at all ! (Grace, with an irrepressible nervous movement, turns 

away at this, and he goes on.) So that our poor friend did accept 
my cousin's death as certified ? 



ACT FIRST 63 

GRACE. 
With your attestation to sustain him, how could he do 
less? 

SIR RALPH, complacent. 

My attestation was unconscious of its fallacy ! 

GRACE. 

Just as poor Mr. Bernal was unconscious of your at- 
testation ! 

SIR RALPH. 

A fellow shouldn't really do such things ! 
GRACE. 

Return so unexpectedly ? 

SIR RALPH. 
After having vanished so finally. 

GRACE. 
There's no doubt he has behaved very ill ; so that if 
Mr. Bedford does hold out, he'll come off better than 
he deserves ! 

SIR RALPH. 

And if Mr. Bedford passes away — ? 

GRACE. 

Don't the actual dispositions take effect ? 

SIR RALPH, thinking an instant ; then just a shade rueful. 

Unless Mark fights. 



64 THE ALBUM 

GRACE. 

Oh, he may fight ! 

SIR RALPH, prompt. 

Do you think he will ? 

GRACE. 

That would depend on his suspicion of how narrowly he 
had missed his luck ! 

SIR RALPH, considering, as if objecting to the expression. 

How "narrowly"? 

GRACE. 

He might guess that it had hung by a hair. 

SIR RALPH. 

What do you call a hair ? 

GRACE. /^ 

Why, your fatal answer to the Vicar. v^-.^^^^^^^^^"^ 

SIR RALPH. 

If it was fatal, madam, it was at least perfectly natural. 

GRACE, after an instant. 

So is Mr. BernaPs disappointment ! 

SIR RALPH, as if with forced and resentful resignation to her 
obj ectionableness. 

Which it's in your power, doubtless, to exacerbate ! 



ACT FIRST 65 

GRACE, quiet. 

I don't know what's in my power, Sir Ralph ! We 
never know till we try. 

SIR RALPH. 

Your threats are in shocking taste, if Mr. Bedford's to 
make another will ! 

GRACE. 

Let us take that quite for granted ! (At the door of the library.) 
And now I must go back to my letters. 

SIR RALPH. 

Before you do so you'll perhaps let me know the motive 

of this extraordinary aggression. (Then more defiant as, with 
her hand on the door of the library, Gracb only stands looking fixedly at him.) 

What the mischief do you mean by it ? 

GRACE, after a moment more of the same significant and expressive attitude. 

Can't you guess ? 

Exit Grace Jesmond. 

SIR RALPH, alone, staring, wondering; then as if with a sudden vision of 
the truth. 

By all that's portentous, I can guess 1 She wants to make 

me propose ! (Then eager, as he sees Mark Beknal : re-enter Mark 

Bernal from the right.) Did he know you ? 

BERNAL. 

The Doctor thought so. He stared for a long moment, 
dear man — ^then he closed his kind eyes. 

VOL. II V 



66 THE ALBUM 

SIR RALPH, in suspense. 

Is he much weaker ? 

BERNAL. 

About the same. 

SIR RALPH. 

Then he'll go on ? 

BERNAL, confident. 

If all goes well. 

SIR RALPH, considering; then after an instant. 

And Tm to go up now ? 

BERNAL, looking at his watch. 

At one, please. (Looking round him.) Where's Miss Jesmond ? 

SIR RALPH. 

She has left me, thank God ! 

BERNAL, surprised. 

Why abnormal gratitude ? 

SIR RALPH. 

P'or miraculous relief. She wants to marry me. She's 
like the others. 

BERNAL. 

The others ? 

SIR RALPH. 

The old woman and the girl. They've marked me, you 
know. But Miss Jesmond has marked me biggest. 



ACT FIRST 67 

BERNAL, 



In bright red chalk ? 

SIR RALPH, with a nervous wriggle. 

I feel it between the shoulders ! She's an intrigante'-&lt;i{ 
a peculiarly dangerous type. 

BERNAL. 

Why, I thought her so charming ! 

SIR RALPH. 

She has made up to you too ? 

BERNAL, smiling. 

Like the others ! 

SIR RALPH. 

She's a hungry adventuress. 

BERNAL. • 

With me it doesn't matter ; I'm not worth their powder. 

SIR RALPH. 

Because you're poor ? 

BERNAL. 

Because I'm nobody. 

SIR RALPH. 

Be duly grateful. It protects you. 

BERNAL. 

My dear man, I like danger ! 



68 THE ALBUM 

SIR RALPH. 
You don't kncnv it ! To know it, you must be exposed. 

BERNAL. 

I see — even as you are. 

SIR RALPH. 

My position is one of the highest peril 

BERNAL. 

You're a match, a catch, a swell : you pay for it ! 

SIR RALPH. 

I pay too much and too often. I pay with my comfort, 
my health, my nerves ! My nerves are gone to pieces 
— I live in a state of siege ! 

BERNAL. 

But you seem to hold out. 

SIR RALPH. 

There are very serious breaches. It's the modem 
methods of attack — they've reduced it to a science. 

BERNAL. 

Lady Basset's a kind of Moltke ? 

SIR RALPH. 

And Miss Jesmond's a kind of Armstrong ! I vow I'm 
doomed to fall ! 



ACT FIRST 69 

BERNAL. 

My dear fellow, don't you desire to fall ? 

SIR RALPH. 

At my own time, in my own place — not in the din of 
battle, amid the yells of victory. 

BERNAL. 

I enjoy the din of battle ; and the yells of victory have 
only to come from pretty lips — ! 

SIR RALPH. 

Do you mean you actually like women ? 

BERNAL. 

It sounds dreadful, but I should be a brute if I didn't. 
They've been my consolation. 

SIR RALPH. 

They're the luxury of the poor ! You can afford natural 
pleasures. You ought to recognise the fact that your 
limitations are your liberty. 

BERNAL. 

The liberty to love ? May I never lose it ! 

SIR RALPH. 

I shall be glad to assist you to retain it. Remain 
exactly as you are, and you will. 



70 THE ALBUM 

BERNAL. 
Tm afraid there's very little doubt that I shall remain 
exactly as I am. I always have remained exactly as I 
am ! You make me feel indeed a sort of eternal tableau 
vivanty and inspire me to positively decline to rise. But 
while I luxuriate in my limitations, as you so happily 
describe them, what on earth will become oiyou ? 

SIR RALPH. 

I shall probably succumb to the mockery of my advan- 
tages and the ferocity of my pursuers. 

BERNAL. 

The real way to escape, my dear man, is to marry. 

SIR RALPH, with a start. 

Marry whom ? 

BERNAL, diverted, staring. 

Any one you like ! 

SIR RALPH, with his hand to his heart. 

I thought you meant Miss Jesmond ! (Giving him his hand.) 
See how my pulse throbs ! 

BERNAL, feeling the hand while Sir Ralph pants. 

You're indeed a wreck ! 

SIR RALPH, instinctively, unconsciously wiping his hand with his pocket- 
handkerchief and going on argumentatively. 

You say "any one I like." But I don't like any one ! 
I hate them all, and yet they're always wM me ! 



ACT FIRST 71 

BERNAL, after looking at him an instant with amused compassion. 

Let me help you ! 

SIR RALPH. 

Upon my soul, I think you ought ! YouVe the happy 
lot — the ideal life ; you owe something to others ! 

BERNAL. 

But what can I do ? 

SIR RALPH. 

Draw the assailants off — ^keep them at bay ! 

BERNAL, considering, responding, entering into it 

While you gain time — ^get away ? Happy thought ! I'll 
do what I can : I'll cover your retreat. 

SIR RALPH. 

I count upon you ! And your profit, your reward — 

BERNAL, taking the words out of his mouth, gaily expressing the idea. 

Will be in the very nature of the task — the exercise of 
my essential freedom ! 

SIR RALPH, pleased, patronising. 

The exercise, say, of your characteristic genius ! (Then 
after an instant) In retum for this relief I should be willing 
to entertain the idea of (hesitating a moment) a formal acknow- 
ledgment. 

BERNAL, vague. 

A formal acknowldgment ? 



72 THE ALBUM 

SIR RALPH. 
Pecuniary ! (Complacent.) You may paint my portrait 

BERNAL. 

Delighted. You're a great subject ! 

SIR RALPH. 

But not for a thousand. 

BERNAL, smilbg. 

For how much ? 

SIR RALPH, debating an instant ; then with the same complacency. 

For a hundred. 

BERNAL, with the same good-humour. 
For a hundred. (Then while Grace Jesmond reappears.) When 

will you sit ? 

Re-enter Gracb Jbsmond from the library, with more addxessed and 
stamped letters. 

SIR RALPH, privately, with intensity, to Brrnal. 

" Sit ? " I can only run ! Cover my retreat ! 

Exit Sir Ralph hastily to the right. 
GRACE, eager ; keeping her letters. 

Did Mr. Bedford know you ? 

BERNAL, smUmg, kind. 

I think I was mysterious to him — very much as you are 
to me/ (Then after an instant) Are you greatly attached to 
him? 



ACT FIRST 73 

GRACE. 
He has been good to me. IVe been of use to him, and 
this beautiful place has been my home. 

BERNAL. 

Shall you leave it — after this ? 

GRACE. 

Naturally I shall leave it. With regret ! 

BERNAL. 

And where shall you go ? 

GRACE. 

I don't know, Mr. Bernal, where I shall go. 

BERNAL. 

Have you no friends ? 

GRACE. 

We don't know what friends we have till we test them. 

BERNAL. 

And have you none of yours whom youVe tested ? 

GRACE, smiling. 

I give people the benefit of doubts ! 

BERNAL. 

Don't be too fond of doubts. Try a little confidence ! 



74 THE ALBUM 

GRACE. 
I daresay I shall have to from this time. You must set 
me the example ! 

BERNAL. 

Is there anything I can do for you — offer you ? 

GRACE, as if much touched, but smiling, and with a certain gentle mockery. 

You speak as if you were powerful ! 

BERNAL. 

You do right to take me up on it. My situation is 
preposterous — there's indeed no service I can render. 

GRACE. 

Your situation will change — and then youll become 
conscious of your power. 

BERNAL. 

Even if I do, I don't think I shall believe in it. The 
only thing I've ever believed in is my freedom ! 

GRACE, after an instant. 

Is freedom very sweet ? 

BERNAL. 

Have you never known it ? 

GRACE. 

Perhaps I shall know it now. 



ACT FIRST 75 

BERNAL. 

If I lose mine, I shall take a tremendous interest in 
yours. 

GRACE. 

You're very kind — but you'll lose nothing. The best 
freedom is to be rich ! 

BERNAL. 

Why are you so bent, Miss Jesmond, on my being 
"rich"? 

GRACE, with genuine intensity. 

Because it costs me too much, here, to-day, to believe 
you're too late ! 

BERNAL, gallant. 

Never too late when in time to see you ! (Then as Lady 
Basset reappears.) And the rest of this woudcrful Company I 

Re-enter Lady Basset from the outer hall, again fully equipped for departure. 
LADY BASSET, eager. 

Sir Ralph's not here ? 

BERNAL. 

He's with our cousin. 

LADY BASSET, in the same manner. 

The will's made ? 

GRACE. 

The will's made. 



76 THE ALBUM 

LADY BASSET. 

And what does he get ? 

GRACE, after an instant. 

He gets everything ! 

Re-enter Maud Vannbck from the outer hall. 

LADY BASSET, in the excitement and effusion of the news ; inadvertent, 
to Maud. 

He gets everything ! 

Re-enter Tbddy Ashdown, dressed to go, with the two bags. 

MAUD, excited. 
Everything? Crhen passing on the news to Teddy.) He getS 

everything ! 

TEDDY, staring. 

Everything ? 

MAUD, enthusiastic 

Everything ! 

LADY BASSET, re-echoing, jubilant 

Everything ! 

Re-enter from the right, as she speaks, Sir Ralph Damant, pale and grave, 
who pauses in the doorway at the sight and sound of these demonstrations, 
with outstretched, warning, commanding hands. 

SIR RALPH, with stem authority. 

Ladies and gentlemen, we're in a house of mourning. 
Our generous host and kinsman has passed away ! 



ACT SECOND 

Mark Bernal's studio, Vandyke Lodge, Chelsea ; a bare, im- 
pecunious, but more or less shabbily-picturesque room, furnished with 
odds and ends and with various signs of a roving past, hand-to-mouth, 
picnicking habits and a Bohemian manner of life : not vulgar, how- 
ever ; only unconventional and casual. The right side is occupied by 
the high glazed studio north-light. At the centre, toward the right, 
the door to the so-called parlour. At the centre, toward the left, the 
door to street, opening first into a small vestibule. Down on the left 
the door to the kitchen and the pantry. Under the big window an 
old faded, battered Chippendale sofa. Down on the left an old- 
fashioned but dilapidated " property" chair with a small table beside 
it. Up at the centre, between the two doors, a bare chimney-piece 
with an unframed picture above it and a table covered with an ancient, 
damaged piece of brocade in front. Half-way down on the right, with 
its face to the light, a large easel with a big new canvas set up on it, 
and a stand beside it with a colour-box and implements. Down on 
the left a smaller easel with a smaller canvas. Watercolour sketches 
and charcoal drawings are tacked on the walls ; several old and new 
canvases are stacked together on the floor. On stools, chairs and 
promiscuous pieces of furniture are scattered in confusion various 
articles of apparel and homely domestic utensils. The air of the 
whole place disgamished and makeshift. 

The stage is unoccupied till the bell from the street-door, suspended within 
sight, tinkles on its old relaxed spring. At the sound of the bell Tbddt 
AsHDOWN hurries out of the parlour, carrying the retarded breakfast-things 
on an extemporised tray. 

TEDDY, flurried, in extreme dishabille, only his shirt and trousers, without 
a necktie. 

A sitter ? Sir Ralph, by Jove ! (Scuttling down to the kitchen 



78 THE ALBUM 

with the tray.) And nothing washed up ! (Disappears moment- 
arily into the kitchen, where the crash of crockery hurriedly set down b heard 
while the hell again, in the stndio, more sharply tinkles. Tkddt emerging, 
more excited, looks about among the scattered garments for something more to 

put on.) I'm scarce ** washed-up " myself^ and (while he catches 

up a pair of bnu;es and iastens them behind) Certainly nOt dreSSed-Up ! 
(While the'.bell sounds a third time he reaches and opens the street-door. Then 
uirprised as Lady Basset is disclosed.) Lady BaSSet ! 

Enter Lady Basset. 
LADY BASSET. equaUy surprised. 

I find you in possession ? 

TEDDY, bis braces dangling behind. 

Sadly uncontested — unless youVe come for your por- 
trait ! 

LADY BASSET, while she looks anxiously round her. 

I've come for Sir Ralph Damant's — knowing his inten- 
tion to sit. 

TEDDY. 

He hasn't sat, worse luck ! We're waiting. 

LADY BASSET. 

You too ? What have you to do with it ? 

TEDDY. 

I'm employed by Mr. Bemal. 

LADY BASSET, looking at him up and down with extreme disapproval. 

Employed — as a model ? 



ACT SECOND 79 

TEDDY, vague ; then amusedly taking the hint. 

You mean for the — undraped? No, I don't pose — 
except to our creditors ! 

LADY BASSET, with visible rigour. 

Have they left you nothing to put on ? 

TEDDY, feverishly looking. 

Plenty if I can only find it ! (Then when, after buttoning his 

braces, he has laid his hands on a waistcoat, a jacket, and a necktie.) Re- 
duced by a parent's rigour to a mere miscellaneous 
wardrobe, IVe fallen back on my artistic nature. 

LADY BASSET, struck, emphatic 

Just what yve fallen back on I 

TEDDY. 

Mr. Bernal had been so kind to me in those agitated 
hours at Courtlands that I ventured to come to see him. 
I feel Fve a little gift that only requires direction. 

LAbY BASSET, encouraged. 

Exactly what / feel ! (Resolute.) He shall also direct 
mine ! — He's out ? 

TEDDY. 

He'll be back in a moment. He kindly puts me up. 

LADY BASSET, struck ; then eager. 

Does he board his pupils ? 

TEDDY. 

On the lowest terms ! 



8o THE ALBUM 

LADY BASSET. 

I shall discuss them with him. 

TEDDY, turpriaed. 

Do you wish him to put you up ? 

LADY BASSET. 

In order to be present at the sittings. 

TEDDY, vague. 

The sittings? 

LADY BASSET. 

That Sir Ralph has promised to give. To watch the 
painter's method. 

TEDDY, after an instant. 

Ain't you afraid he may watch yours ? 

LADY BASSET. 

I have none. I'm a creature of inspiration. 

TEDDY. 

But while you're abandoned to your inspiration what will 
become of dear Maud ? 

LADY BASSET. 

I've thrown her up. (After an instant.) Dear Maud's at 
large ! 

TEDDY, alert. 

Then I may enjoy her ? 



ACT SECOND 8i 

LADY BASSET. 

When did I ever prevent you ? 

TEDDY, recollecting, conceding. 

You did give a fellow a chance ! 

LADY BASSET, with abrupt and winning familiarity. 

Then let a fellow give me one ! (Appealing sociably.) Back 

me up ! (Then after an instant.) I Vc COme tO Stay ! (Eager, 
as the street-door opens.) Here he is ! (Then disconcerted, disap- 
pointed, as Mark Bernal appears : enter Mark Bernal from the street.) 

Oh! 

TEDDY, to Bernal. 

She's come to stay ! 

BERNAL, in informal but recognisable mourning ; coijimg down, gay, 
gallant, to Lady Basset. 

That's a note of defiance. We never release the fair ! 

TEDDY. 

She wants to study your method. 

BERNAL, to Lady Basset. 

Of dealing with the fair ? 

LADY BASSET, flattered, arch. 

That I know too well ! (After an instant) Of dealing with 
the timid ! 

BERNAL, sociable, encouraging, moving a chair. 

I begin with asking them to be seated. 

VOL. II G 



82 THE ALBUM 

LADY BASSET, taking the seat. 

Fm not speaking of myself — I'm speaking of Sir Ralph. 

BERNAL, eager. 

You've brought him with you ? 

LADY BASSET, alarmed. 

Brought him ? Won't he come of himself? 

BERNAL, unscrupulotisly amiable. 

He would if he knew you were here ! (Then, as with a happy 
thought, to Teddy.) I say — ^go and tell him ! 

TEDDY, vague. 

This moment ? 

BERNAL. 

At his noble mansion in Portland Place. 

LADY BASSET, staring. 

Has he moved to Portland Place ? . 

BERNAL. 

With his great new wealth ! 

LADY BASSET, rueful. 

While I've been writing to his chambers ! 

BERNAL, prompt, plausible. 

That's why you've had no answer ! He has now set up 
a palace. 

LADY BASSET, much impressed. 

A palace ? 



ACT SECOND 83 

BERNAL, laughing. 

Perhaps I should say a fortress ! 

LADY BASSET, conadering, politic, to Teddy. 

Don't go— I'll wait ! 

BERNAL. 
He must go for the beer. (Very friendly, to Lady Bassbt.) If 

you consent to share our fortunes, you'll perhaps share 
our refreshment ! 

LADY BASSET, looking at him ; tenderly significant. 

I'll pretend so — to be alone with you I 

BERNAL, responsive, smiling. 

I delight to be alone with you I (To Tbddy.) Have you 
any money? 

TEDDY. 

No ; have you ? 

BERNAL. 
Look in the teacup. (To Lady Basset, while Teddy goes up to the 

chimney-piece.) The teacup's our bank — a bank that's 
always breaking ! 

TEDDY, accidentally, as he reaches up for the cup, knocking it over and 
smashing it. 

It's broke now \ 

BERNAL, as he looks at the fragments ; good-humoured. 

Naturally — with nothing in it ! Won't they trust me ? 



84 THE ALBUM 

LADY BASSET, with renewed archness. 

They're wiser than I^ Mr. Bernal ! (Then to teddy, with her 
hand in her pocket.) But here's a shilling — to get rid of you ! 

(To Bernal, as Tbddy accepts the shilling and he protests with a gesture.) 

I'll take it out in lessons. 

TEDDY, who has picked up his hat ; at the street door, to Bernal. 

I told her your terms were low ! 

Exit Teddy to the street. 
BERNAL, struck, as if with a happy thought. 

Do you desire a course of instruction ? 

LADY BASSET, simpering. 

I feel I've a little gift that only requires direction. 

BERNAL, amused, encouraging. 
Your little gifts are profuse ! (Then as he picks up the morsels of 
the teacup.) If I form a school (cheerful, hopeful) I can gO in 
for a little jug with a slit ! (Having put away the pieces.) 

You're a messenger from heaven — we're living on hopes ! 

LADY BASSET, vague. 

Hopes of what ? 

BERNAL. 

Of bread and butter. Of my cousin's arrival, and his 

splendid pose. (With the vivid artistic ^dsion— a flourish of his hand 

before his eyes.) I sce his pose already ! 

LADY BASSET, with the same flourish. 

So do I ! 

BERNAL, with sudden ruefulness. 

But what I don't see yet is the " honorarium " 1 



ACT SECOND 85 

LADY BASSET. 
Is it to be so heavy ? 

BERNAL. 

A hundred pounds — the Millennium. (Sad.) The 
Millennium never comes ! 

LADY BASSET, reassuring. 

T^m not the Golden Age, no doubt ; but 1*11 pay every 
week. 

BERNAL, gallant. 

Dear lady, you pay every minute ! (Then jovial, making his 

preparations for her lesson, drawing out the smaller easel.) Oh, I shall 

get on — Teddy saves me a butler. 

LADY BASSET, as she draws oflf her gloves, smiling at him engagingly. 

What shall / save you ? 

BERNAL, after an instant ; rising to the occasion. 

The pursuit of lovely woman — if I may worship her at 
home ! 

LADY BASSET, wamingly, with arch-prudery. 

You must speak to me only of Art — for in Art there is 
no Impropriety ! 

BERNAL, gay. 

I quite understand that if there were, you'd never have 

entered (indicating with amused irony his shabby surroundings) this 

dedicated temple ! (Reassuring.) It's a ground on which 
we may meet with perfect delicacy ! (Then after pUdng a 

drawing-board on the smaller easel) What's the nature Of yOUr 

talent ? 



S6 THE ALBUM 

LADY BASSET, rising. 
The nature ? (Thinluiig, whlk he helps her off with her jacket ; then 

with effusion.) Sincere ! 

BERNAL, giving her a charcoal study of his own. 

Then copy that head — it's nice and fresh ! 

LADY BASSET, with the head, examining it. 

I must do it, you know, as \feel it ! 

BERNAL, anxious. 

Don't " feel " it too much — it may come off ! (Then, as 

she has put the sketch on a rest near the easel and seated herself) Do yOU 

mind if I change my coat ? 

LADY BASSET, seated at the easel, beginning her work from the sketch. 

Don't we agree that in Art there is no Impropriety ? 

BERNAL, amused, while he puts on an old black velveteen jacket taken 
down from a nail on which he has suspended his other coat. 

I don't change it for " Art " — I change it for economy. 
Do you mind if I smoke a pipe ? 

LADY BASSET, very vivacious, while she works. 

Do you mind if / do ? 

BERNAL. 

Alas, we've only two, and Teddy has the other ! (Then 

behind her, overlooking her start, while he stuffs and lights his pipe) 

Haven't you got the head awfully in the corner ? 

LADY BASSET, leaning back, with her own head very much on one side. 

That's how I feel it ! 



ACT SECOND 87 

BERNAL, amased, resigned, going over to his own easel. 

You feel it in a funny place ! 

LADY BASSET, working. 

My talent's intensely personal. 

BERNAL. 

Forgive me if my remarks are ! 

LADY BASSET. 

Absorbed in my inspiration, I become a monster of in- 
difference. (Then after a fit of rubbing her work and falling back, while 
Bernal lifts the big blank canvas off his easel, stands it against the wall and 
prepares something he can go on with.) What On earth dO€S keep 

him? 

BERNAL, preoccupied, standing at his easel 

Teddy, with that blessed beer ? 

LADY BASSET, in attitudes. 

Sir Ralph — the false, the faithless ! 

BERNAL, painting. 

He's paralysed by his prudence. 

LADY BASSET. 

He may indeed have been prudent with nie, but I can't 
pretend he has been paralysed. I've had startling 
glimpses of his passion ! 

BERNAL. 

Don't build on his passion — it's hollow. 



SS THE ALBUM 

LADY RASSET. aaoi 

Hollow? 



BERXAL. ! 

Inane — ^insane. Fate has marked him to stand alone! 

LADY BASSET, abnned, protestiiicr. 

Alone? 

BERNAL, with great sincerity, as he worics. 

He's SO rich, so brilliant, so gifted, that he's condemned 
to a splendid solitude. He sees all men as sordid — he 
sees all women as venaL A cruel doom has forbidden 
him to believe in human affection. 

LADY BASSET. 

And do you believe in it ? 

BERNAL, leaving his easel, smiling. 

I think it's my only faith ! And I've one thing that he 
hasn't — the freedom to cultivate it ! 

LADY BASSET. 

You've cultivated it in vain, since — like him ! — you stand 
alone. 

BERNAL. 

Alone ? Not a bit — ^with you here ! 

LADY BASSET. 

You're evidently afraid to marry. 

BERNAL. 

You're quite mistaken. Try me ! 



ACT SECOND 89 

LADY BASSET, startled, vague. 

"Try "you? 

BERNAL, cheerful, encouraging. 
Propose and you'll see ! (Then laughing, as she gives a shocked 

gesture) They do to Ralph ! 

LADY BASSET, struck, assenting. 

Dear Maud has done it, I know ! (Then after an insunt) And 
I strongly suspect Miss Jesmond. 

BERNAL, wondering. 

Miss Jesmond ? 

LADY BASSET. 

I know she has proposed to others ! 

BERNAL, after an instant. 

Well — she has been refused all round ! 

LADY BASSET, struck again, alarmed, seizing his arm. 

Do you suppose she has got him now ? 

BERNAL, vague, just wondering again. 

Now? 

LADY BASSET, with a sudden vision of the truth, while Teddy Ashdown 
reappears : re-enter Teddy Ashdown precipitately, with his tankard of 
beer, from the street, leaving the door open behind him. 

That creature keeps him away ! 

TEDDY, as he comes down with his beer and Lady Basset turns back to 
her work ; privately and excitedly to Bbrnal. 

He's come ! he's come : his footman's looking for the 
house ! 



90 THE ALBUM 

BERNAL, startled ; then, as if abruptly confessing, with great mgency and 
plausibility, to Lady Basset. 

Teddy announces a model ! 

LADY BASSET, agitated. 

A female ? 

TEDDY. 

The sort of thing you thought / was ! 

LADY BASSET, hesitating. 

For the figure ? 

BERNAL, assenting, smiling. 
But not a female. (Then, on a gesture of Lady Basset's ; as if out of 
consideration for her delicacy) Will yOU retire tO the parlour ? 

LADY BASSET, considering, as if to measure the full bearings of the situa- 
tion ; then majestically catching up her jacket ; to protect her purity. 

I'll retire ! (At the door of the parlour, which Teddy has opened for her ; 

resolute.) IVe come to Stay ! 

Exit Lady Basset. 

BERNAL, urgent, to Teddy. 

Stay with her ! (Exit Thddy Ashdown to the parlour, while Bernal 
eagerly meets Sir Ralph, who appears in the open doorway. Enter Sir Ralph 
Damant from the street.) YouVe COme tO sit ? 

SIR RALPH, in deep, distinguished mourning ; visibly and unfavoumbly 
impressed by his cousin's Bohemian accessories. 

Do you consider there's anything to sit on ? 

BERNAL, laughing. 

Some of the chairs have legs, and some have backs — 



ACT SECOND 91 

SIR RALPH, as he looks criticaUy round. 
But none have both ! (Then checking Bbrnal gravely in the move- 
ment to provide him with a seat) There are preliminaries— con- 
ditions. 

BERNAL, arrested but amused. 

Why, I thought we had settled them at Courtlands ! 

SIR RALPH, after an instant. 

Do you mean the sum to be paid ? 

BERNAL. 

Paid, my dear Ralph (hesitating, smiling) as soon as you're 
so very good as to pay it ! 

SIR RALPH, surprised and as if resenting his avidity. 

How can I pay it before I judge of the likeness ? 

BERNAL. 

How can you judge of the likeness before I've a chance 
to catch it ? (Laughmg.) " First catch your hare ! " 

SIR RALPH. 

Your images make me shudder ! — all the more that 
(thanks to the rigour of my mourning!) I've enjoyed 
for a while a period of exemption from the chase. Now 
that IVe quitted my retreat — 

BERNAL. 

It's only to remind me of that charming feature of our 
contract — 



93 THE ALBUM 

SIR RALPH. 

Your guarantee of safety — ! 

BERNAL, interrupting again in turn ; good-humoured. 

And resemblance! So that it's not till I hand you 
these commodities — 

SIR RALPH. 

Over the counter, as it were, that I hand you a hundred 
pounds ! 

[BERNAL, disappointed, but trying to be cheerful ; about to lay his hands 
gaily oii Sir Ralph, as if to put him in position. 

The attitude's found — I'll do you in the act ! 

SIR RALPH, struck, approving. 

And call the picture "The Patron of Art," or "The 
Friend in Need '' ? Before I can throw myself into that 
character with the requisite calm, iVe a deep anxiety to 
allay. 

BERNAL, impatient. 

Another ? 

SIR RALPH. 

There's always another! How have you disposed of 
Miss Jesmond ? 

BERNAL, blank. 

Disposed of her ? Not at all ! 

SIR RALPH, displeased. 

Then you don^t carry out our bargain ? 



ACT SECOND 93 

BERNAL. 
Such a bargain as that ? It takes three to make it ! I 
haven't seen the tip of her nose. 

SIR RALPH, wondering, grave. 

She's lying low ? 

BERNAL, ndsmg and dropping his arms ; irresponsible. 

She has vanished from my ken ! 

SIR RALPH, reflecting. 

She's laying a train. 

BERNAL. 

Then it's a very long one ! You remember when she 
quitted Courtlands ? 

SIR RALPH, assenting. 

The day of her patron's death. 

BERNAL, with a certain veiled, sarcastic bitterness. 

His patrdnage had limits — as appeared by his will ! 

SIR RALPH, after an instant 

Do you allude to his overlooking you ? 

BERNAL. 

To his overlooking her. 

SIR RALPH. 

She had five years of pickings. 



94 THE ALBUM 

BERNAL. 
Do you mean that she still has resources ? 

SIR RALPH, with the same serenity. 

Her character — which is unmistakable — supplies them 
in abundance. 

BERNAL, after an instant ; as if thinking this over. 

If you haven't seen her, how should I ? 

SIR RALPH. 

You were so grossly indiscreet as to boast to her of my 
order. 

BERNAL, smiling. 

Forgive my natural pride ! But if she has found no 
pretext for approaching you — 

SIR RALPH, interrupting. 
I tremble at every ring ! (Then with a violent sUrt, as the bell of the 
street-door sounds out) There • she JS ! (To himself, seeing Tbddv 
burst out of the parlour to answer the bell : re-enter Teddy Ashdown from 
the parlour) And there he is ! (Then to Bernal, while Teddy 
passes to the street-door ; quickly moving to the parlour) Let me eSCapC ! 

BERNAL, alarmed, catching, intercepting him, while Teddy opens the street- 
door and Maud Vanneck appears. 

Not there ! 

Enter Maud Vanneck from the street 
TEDDY, welcoming Maud ; delighted. 

So jolly of you to look a fellow up 1 



ACT SECOND 95 

SIR RALPH, relieved, but still highly disgusted. 

Permit me to dissent from that ! 

TEDDY, explaining her to the others. 

Lady Basset chucks her. 

MAUD, cheerful 

But I can face the usual dangers ! 

SIR RALPH. 

That's more, madam, than / can do ! (Then aside to Bernal, 

while Maud allows Teddy joyfully to divest her of her jacket and feather boa) 

I leave the housie ! 

BERNAL, genuinely distressed. 

Where'U you go ? 

SIR RALPH, thinking; with dignity. 

ril drive on the Embankment. 

BERNAL, urgent. 

And you'll come back — ? 

SIR RALPH, at the street-door. 

When you've worked her off! 

Exit Sir Ralph. 
MAUD, disconcerted ; with compunction. 

I've driven Sir Ralph away ! 

TEDDY. 

What do you want of Sir Ralph when you've got a fellow 
like me ? 



96 THE ALBUM 

BERNAL, impatient 

She has got nothing of the sort, Teddy. You'll please 
to return to your studies. 

TEDDY, resenting this decree, with injured dignity. 

If you didn't take me, Mr. Bernal, for nothing — 

BERNAL, good-humoured, gay. 

I should take you for a dangerous rival ! And on the 
mere chance I banish you ! 

TEDDY, at the door to the parlour. 

When I can I'll pay you ! 

Exit Teddy Ashdown. 
BERNAL, to Maud. 

To what do I owe the honour of your visit ? 

MAUD. 

Abandoned by my natural protectors, Fve fallen back 
on my artistic nature. I feel Fve a little gift that only 
requires direction. 

BERNAL, eager. 

You enter my school ? 

MAUD, reluctant, indicating the parlour. 

Do you mean that place ? 

BERNAU 

It's there that I hold my class ! 



ACT SECOND 97 

MAUD. 
But where do you paint Sir Ralph ? 

BERNAL, disconcerted. 

Did I tell you too I was to paint him ? 

MAUD. 

Miss Jesmond told me — at Courtlands. You know we 
came away together. 

BERNAL, alert. 

Where did Miss Jesmond go ? 

MAUD. 

She came to London. 

BERNAL. 

And where is she now ? 

MAUD, with asperity. 

I haven't the least idea ! (Then more persuasive.) You must 
let me see you at work. 

BERNAL. 

At work on Sir Ralph ? You mustn't let me see you I 

MAUD, after an instant ; arch. 

Do you fear him too as a rival ? 

BERNAL, blank. 

A rival ? 

VOL. II H 



98 THE ALBUM 

MAUD. 
Isn't that what you call Mr. Ashdown ? 

BERNAL. 

As a manner of speaking ! If I fear my cousin as a 

rival, it's as a -rival to Teddy. (After an instant, coaxing.) I 

should like much better to see you at work on him ! 
He's a fine little chap, is Teddy. 

MAUD, impatient. 

Dear Mr. Bernal, I don't want a fine little chap. I 
want a man of the world — and a man of means. I want 

social distinction. I want (thinking; then with vain emphasis) 

oh, I want a lot of things ! 

BERNAL. 

Yes ; you all want a lot of things. I should think it 
would be enough to want a little thing called happiness ! 

MAUD. 

But happiness depends on such a lot ! 

BERNAL. 

Does yours depend on your bringing down Sir Ralph ? 

MAUD, after an instant. 
You're awfully vulgar, you know ! (Then after another instant. 

Do you beheve I can ? 

BERNAL. 

I believe almost any woman can experiment successfully 
on almost any man. 



ACT SECOND 99 

MAUD» eager. 

Make him love her? 

BERNAL. 

Yes — and make him hate her for doing it ! You're 
young, you're pretty, you're clever — 

MAUD, interrupting, complacent. 

And I've had the Higher Education ! 

BERNAL, smiling. 
The Higher, but not the Highest ! (Then more gravely, but 
very kindly.) The cducation of UnSClfish affection ! (Pleading, 

sociably, tenderly.) Think a little more of that, and a little 
less of baubles and baronets ! Don't misapply your 
gifts; don't pervert your youth; don't harden your 
heart. (After an instant.) Don't try to get on without love ! 

MAUD, as if struck, incipiently charmed, by his appeal. 

Have you tried ? 

BERNAL. 

Not for a single hour ! I've loved, though I've lost ! 
So, bare as you see me here, I dispense with a lot of 
things. I'm rich in faith. 

MAUD. 

Faith in what ? 

BERNAL. 

In the present woman — whoever she is ! 

MAUD. 

And what do you do about the absent ? 



loo THE ALBUM 

BERNAL, laughing. 

I don't recognise the absent. She's always the loser ! 

MAUD, after an instant. 

If I were to marry you I think I'd look after you ! 

BERNAL. 

I want some one awfully to look after me. 

MAUD. 
With such a person, and (lool^mg rather compassionately round her) 

such a home, you'd enter upon a union — ? 

BERNAL, prompt. 

In a moment — in Teddy's place ! 

MAUD, disconcerted, called back to reality while the bell of the street-door 
rings. 

Oh, Teddy's— ! 

Re-enter Teddy Ashdown precipitately from the parlour. 
BERNAL. 

Teddy's place is to answer the bell. 

MAUD, eager, while Teddy goes to the door. 

Sir Ralph back ? 

TEDDY, opening the street-door, announcing, exclaiming. 

Dear old Miss Jesmond ! 

Enter Grace Jesmond. ' 



ACT SECOND loi 

BERNAL, with astonishment and alacrity, meeting her. 

Miss Jesmond ! 

GRACE, who has paused an instant, as if, at the sight of Maud, with a last 
irrepressible hesitation. 

I had your address. 

BERNAL, rejoicing. 

How jolly — it was in that book ! 

TEDDY, sociable, ingenuous. 

Oh yes, in that book ! 

GRACE, pale, tired, appreciably altered ; in simple, economical mourning ; 
addressing Teddy very kindly, but markedly as if to check him. 

I'm glad to find you, Mr. Ashdown. 

MAUD, who on Grace's entrance has passed in visible displeasure to the sofa 
under the window, where she has seated herself ; hearing this. 

Mr. Ashdown ! (Teddy hurries over to her and talks with her.) 
BERNAL, to Grace, in frank wonderment and appreciation. 

You've put on mourning — when he left you nothing ? 

GRACE, at the left, gcavely indicating his own garb while she sinks upon the 
other sofa. 

What did he leave you ? (Then as Bernal, with a motion as of 

cheerful, resigned dismissal of the subject, places himself beside her.) I've 

come to see you (after an instant) on account of your pro- 
fession. 

BERNAL, struck, amused. 

You too have a little gift — ? 



I02 THE ALBUM 

GRACE, vague. 

A little gift ? 

BERNAL, laughing. 

That only requires direction ! 

GRACE, smiling sadly. . 

rm afraid I've no gift at all — that's exactly why I've 
come. (After an insunt) I must find employment. 

BERNAL, vague. 

As an amanuensis ? 

GRACE. ' 

I've tried for that — in vain. 

BERNAL, sympathetic. 

Nobody wants one ? 

GRACE, with the same sad smile ; discouraged, resigned. 

Everybody has one ! 

BERNAL, smiling. 

/ haven't, Miss Jesmond ; but on the other hand — 

GRACE, as he pauses. 

You've SO little correspondence ? 

BERNAL. 

I fear it's of a sort (after an instant, laughing) not to be deputed 
to another. 

GRACK 
It's not with that idea that I've ventured to approach 



ACT SECOND 103 

you. (Then after a supreme hesitation.) YouVc the Only artist 

I happen to know — and I've come to suggest myself as 
a model. 

BERNAL, wonderstruck. 

A model ? 

MAUD, overhearing, rising ; to Teddy. 
A model ? (Then as she seizes the idea ; with emphatic compunction.) 

That's what / ought to have done ! 

TEDDY, on his feet, equally struck, delighted. 

It's not too late will you sit to me ? (Then eager, to Bbrnal, 

indicating Maud.) May she sit tO me ? 

BERNAL, rising, struck, thinking an instant ; then happy to adopt the 
suggestion. 

Certainly — in the parlour ! 

TEDDY, disconcerted, objecting. 

With Lady Basset ? 

MAUD, astonished. 

Lady Basset? 

TEDDY, explaining. 

She's the Second Pupil. 

BERNAL, insistent. 

The Second Pupil must have the same advantages as 
the First ! Therefore (settling the matter, to Maud) you must 
sit to both of them ! 

MAUD, majestic and sarcastic, looking at Grace. 

While Miss Jesmond sits to you ? 



I04 THE ALBUM 

BERNAL, after an instant, gay. 

Miss Jesmond's professional ! 

Maud, at this, gives a shocked gesture and, as if retiring to avoid some inde- 
corous exhibition, goes up with Teddy, who ushers and follows her into the 
parlour while Bernal returns to Grace. 

GRACE, who during this discussion has sat motionless, only with her eyes 
attentively wandering over the tell-tale indications of the place. 

Not yet — but I really want to be ! 

BERNAL, on the sofa again. 

YouVe quite without resources ? 

GRACE, very simple. 

Quite without resources. 

BERNAL. 

You've never been able to save ? 

GRACE. 

IVe a sister (after an instant) whoiu I help. Her husband's 
dying — she has children — she has troubles. So you see 
I must do something — and do it soon. There are 
people I've seen, in past years, at Courtlands — it's to 
those people I've been. It was at Courtlands I sslw you 
— and it's to you I come last. (After a moment.) IVe been 
to shops, first. I've been told to come again — ^and I've 
gone again. But it's the same everywhere — there's 
nothing to be had. It occurred to me at last that I had 
heard of girls who earn money — however little ! — by 



ACT SECOND 105 

sitting to painters; sitting for the head, the hair, the 
hands, for — ^what do you call it ? — the " type" ; in story- 
book attitudes, in short- waisted frocks, in old faded 
Kate Greenaway dresses. So I thought there might be 
a demand (smiUng again) and that I might — with a little 
patience ! — do something to meet it. I'm perhaps not 
clumsier — nor uglier ! — than some. Pm willing to try 
hard, to do my best ; and if it's only a question of keep- 
ing still oh, I can do that : so still so still ! (Then after 

an instant, brave, simple.) Anything tO boil the pOt ! 

BERNAL, who has listened intently. 

Your idea's ingenious — but is there nothing else you 
can do? 

GRACE. 

I've hunted up and down for a month. And the only 
definite thing I've found is how many others are hunting 
— a thousand partners in the chase ! 

BERNAL, laughing. 

Diana and all her nymphs ! So you've kindly come to 
me—? 

GRACE. 

In my ignorance of the next best step. 

BERNAL, very kind. 

It's a cruel change — from your life at Courtlands. 

GRACK 

Do you remember you told me at Courtlands that free- 
dom is sweet ? (After an instant.) I'm tasting its sweetness ! 



io6 THE ALBUM 

BERNAL, after a moment. 

I wish I could assist you ! 

GRACE, with extreme but suppressed apprehension. 

Vm not the " type " ? IVe not the appearance — ? 

BERNAL, abrupt. 

YouVe the appearance, Miss Jesmond, of an angel ! 

GRACE, rising quickly ; concluding. 

But you've simply no present use for me ! 

BERNAL, rising ; then with the artist's gesture of evocation. 

I see you perfectly — I place you — I catch you. But 

(with a sad smile and a slow head-shake) I lose yOU again ! 

GRACE, looking vaguely about. 
Of course you Ve plenty of people. (Then after an instant.) Do 

you happen to know some painter — ? 

BERNAL, falling in, thinking. 

Who would be ready for such a sitter ? There isn't a 
fellow in London who wouldn't rejoice in the chance ! 

(Then feeling his pockets for a notebook ; looking round for something to write 

on.) I'll give you the best addresses. 

GRACE, as he comes down again, finding nothing. 

You're looking for notepaper ? 

BERNAL, embarrassed, ashamed ; still looking. 
We had a sheet last week ! (Then blushing, conscious, smlUng, 

while he confesses his destitution.) You'rc not in a land of plenty ! 



ACT SECOND 107 

GRACE, looking at bim an instant, then abruptly drawing the sketchbook of 
Act First from under her mantle. 

Write in that. 

BERNAL, recognising gaily his book. 

My album — you've brought it back ? 

GRACE. 
IVe brought it back. (After an instant.) I thought you 
might need it. 

BERNAL, laughing, scribbling addresses on a leaf of the album. 

You see I do ! 

GRACE, looking about the place again while he writes. 

It's your only one ? 

BERNAL, writing, preoccupied, smiling. 

My one ewe-lamb ! 

GRACE. 

It was good of you to give it to me 

BERNAL, still writing. 

Don't praise me — ^when I take it back ! 

GRACE, smiling. 

I put you to special expenses ! 

BERNAL, tearing out of the album the leaf on which he has written ; folding 
and giving it to her. 

You see I stagger beneath them ! 



io8 THE ALBUM 

GRACE, with the paper, which she slowly puts into her portemoonaie. 

But I also see you have pupils. 

BERNAL, smUing. 

I take them for nothing. 

GRACE. 

You're too generous. (Then after a moment.) But youVc 
had orders. 

BERNAL. 

For portraits ? I've had one, thank heaven ! 

GRACE, after another moment. 

From Sir Ralph Damant ? 

BERNAL, struck. 

You knew it ? 

GRACE 
You told me at Courtlands. (Then as he gives a lively gesture of 

rccoUection.) YouVc had no Other ? 

BERNAL, philosophic. 

No other. 

GRACE. 

Is Sir Ralph finished ? 

BERNAL. 

He's not begun. He begins to-day. 

GRACE, as if definitely influenced by this ; thinking. 

To-day? 



ACT SECOND 109 

BERNAL, noticing her interest in the question ; attentive. 

He comes to sit — ^you may meet him. 

GRACE, considering, assenting. 

I see — 1 may meet him. 

BERNAL, laughing. 

He may meet you ! 

GRACE, who has moved away an instant, and once more has turned her eyes 
over the room ; speaking at last, as she faces him again, abruptly. 

Mr. Bernal — are you very poor ? 

BERNAL. 

Do you suppose. if I were not I would decline your 
splendid offer ? The stupid, sordid truth, Miss Jesmond, 
is that I can't afford a model ! 

GRACE, grave. 
I see. (Then with mfinite gentleness.) I'm very SOrry. 

BERNAL. 

You can't be sorrier than I ! It was awfully nice of you 
to come ; but youVe brought your etapty pitcher to a 
thirsty land ! 

GRACE, after an instant. 

You're as poor as I am ? 

BERNAL. 

You make me feel much poorer ! And it's^ the first 
time my condition has seemed to me (bringing out the word 

with expression, resentment) Ugly ! 



no THE ALBUM 

GRACE. 
It's the first time mine has seemed to me endurable ! 

CThta as she visibly lingers, delays to go» takes another survey of the studio.) 

Do you live without— comfort ? 

BERNAL, laughing. 

With such comfort as you behold ! 

GRACE, taking out again the paper he has given her. 

And these artists are rich ? 

BERNAL. 

They're richer. Do try them ! 

GRACE, looking at the list. 
I'll try them. (Then stiU stationary, with the list in her hand.) It's 

your cousin's hour ? 

BERNAL. 

It's my cousin's hour. 

GRACE. 

Then I suppose I ought to go. 

BERNAL, after a moment 

Your time of course is limited. 

GRACE, continuing to twist her paper nervously, without any movement of 
departure. 

My necessity indeed presses. (Then after an instant.) From 
the moment my business is over — 



ACT SECOND in 

BERNAL, smiling, as she vaguely pauses. 

YouVe no reason to stay ? 

GRACE. 

None I can conveniently express. (Smiling.) I'm not, 
like Miss Vanneck, a pupil. 

BERNAL, laughing. 

Nor like my Lady Basset ! (After an instant.) They can 
express their reason ! 

GRACE, as if thinking what this can be ; then bringing it out 

Sir Ralph Damant ? 

BERNAL. 

They want to corner him ! 

GRACE, looking down while she speaks. 

To "corner" him? 

BERNAL. 
To marry him ! 

GRACE, after an instant. 

Both? 

BERNAL, laughing. 

Both ! 

GRACE. 

And they're waiting for him ? 

BERNAL. 

They're waiting for him ! 



112 THE ALBUM 

GRACE, after an instant, smiling, but as if thinking. 

/won't, then. 

BERNAL, pretendingly jocular. 

You'll call on him at home ? 

GRACE, with her eyes on him a moment in silence. 

Where does he live ? 

BERNAL. 

Portland Place, 130. 

GRACE. 

Thank you. (Then looking again at her list.) If thcse gentle- 
men employ me — 

BERNAL, emphatical but sad, as she pauses. 

You'll be SO taken up that I shall never see you again ! 

GRACE, who has finally, wearily put away her paper and gathered her mantle 
round her. 

Good-bye, Mr. Bernal. 

BERNAL, after an instant 

Good-bye, Miss Jesmond. 

GRACE, turns away from him as if to move to the door, taking as she does so 
a supreme look round. Then suddenly, in this act, she falters, totters 
slightly, raises her hand to her head, as if faint or giddy, with an ejaculation 
of distress. 

Ah! 

BERNAL, moving, anxious, quick, to her assistance. 

YouVe ill ? 



ACT SECOND 113 

GRACE, reaching out to support herself. 

I'm faint ! 

BERNAL, catching, sustaining her 

You're exhausted — you're quite done ! 

GRACE, panting, trymg to recover herself, while Lady Basset reappears. 

Walking over London — since breakfast ! 

Re-enter Lady Basset from the parlour. 

LADY BASSET, stopping short, arrested, scandalised by the sight of Bernal 
closely holding, apparently embracing, Grace. 

Mr. Bernal, what on earth are you doing ? 

BKRNAL, startled, while he quickly separates from Grace ; embarrassed, but 
smiling and plausibly explaining. 

Setting up my model ! 

LADY BASSET. 
Your model ? (Then struck, inspired, looking from one of them to the 

other.) I've come in to tell you that my little gift requires 
more direction than you seem to have time for. So, 
with leisure on my hands, why shouldn't / perform that 
function ? 

BERNAL. 

Sit for me — in character? (Gay.) You'd come ex- 
pensive

to "stay" ; prompt. 

Let it not be a question of money. I'll do it for love !

GRACE, gathering herself together again with a wan smile for Bernal. 

Profit by such a chance. Good-bye ! 

BERNAL, doubly reluctant now to let her go ; seizing a pretext for detaining 
and refreshing her. 

YouVe had nothing since breakfast? Models have 
appetites ! (Bethinking himself, casting about.) They particu- 
larly depend on their tea. 

LADY BASSET. 

I particularly depend on mine ! 

BERNAL. 

I think there is some — somewhere or other. 

GRACE, pulling herself together. 

Then I won't refuse it. 

BERNAL, to Lady Basset, invitingly, after he has quickly opened the door 
of the kitchen. 

I daresay it's in there. There's something in the nature 
of a kettle — ! 

LADY BASSET, aloof, mindful only of her dignity and her clothes. 

Shall I call Mr. Ashdown to make it boil ? 

GRACE, suddenly reviving, interposing, catching at the occasion to remain. 

Let me make it boil ! (With a brightened smile.) Fm all right 
as soon as I work ! 

BERNAL, unwilling, protesting, while she eagerly unfastens her mantle. 

Work ? Not in your condition ! 



ACT SECOND 115 

GRACE, quite gay. 

Isn't it exactly what my condition wants ? (Then while he 

has helped her off with her cloak and taken it from her.) I'll take off my 
hat ! (Removing and giving it to him to put with the cloak.) And pin 
up the skirt of my only frock ! (Turning up her dress till it shows 
half her petticoat, and passing Bernal a pin.) Will yOU do it ? 

LADY BASSET, watching her with discomfiture as Bbrnal fastens the skirt 
behind ; to herself. 

Why didn't I think of thatl 

BERNAL, vague, hopeful, to Grace, who has reached the door of the kitchen. 

There are things — if you can make them out. 

GRACE, who has taken her hat and jacket back from him ; at the door. 

I'll make them out ! 

Exit Grace Jbsmond. 
LADY BASSET. 

Is there bread and butter ? 

BERNAL. 

I've an earnest trust ! 

LADY BASSET, while Grace reopens the door of the kitchen. 

And any little extra ?

addressing Lady Basset from the door of the kitchen. 

I'll ascertain !

In the course of recreation, (indicating the kitchen.) They're 
making tea.

precation.) It ain't enough !

TEDDY, explaining, coaxing. 

To the purchase of some little extra. (Then as Maud, staring, 

gives a gesture of depressed destitution and the bell of the street-door sounds.) 

It's Sir Ralph ! 

MAUD, while Teddy hurries to the door. 

Get the money from him / 

Re-enter Sir Ralph by the door that Tbddy opens ; then stops in dismay at 
the sight of the two women. 

LADY BASSET, instantly advancing upon him. 

Will you give us half-a-crown ? 

MAUD, engaging. 

To buy some innocent relish. 

SIR RALPH, bewildered, shocked. 

Half-a-crown — for an innocent relish ? (Then as if considering. 
It's a monstrous price ! 

LADY BASSET, persuasive. 

For a treat to Mr. Bernal ? 

TEDDY. 

He has nothing for tea !

Nothing ? (As if reflecting, calculating, while he takes out his purse.

Grace sets the tray on the table before the chimney and the other ladies clear 

a place for it.) Whcre's your honour ?

BERNAL. 

I admit she did. 

SIR RALPH, triumphant. 

Then it's proved ! 

BERNAL, affected by what Sir Ralph has said, worried and discomposed ; 
watching Grace an instant at the table with the other ladies ; then with a 
nervous laugh. 

Yes it's "proved " ! (He goes uneasily up while Lady Basset, 

carrying a cup of tea, comes down to Sir Ralph.) 

LADY BASSET. 

A cup of tea, dear friend ? 

SIR RALPH, taking the cup from her as if under uncanny coercion ; 
looking at her in deep mistrust. 

What have you put in it ? 



I20 THE ALBUM 

LADY BASSET, beaming. 

My gratitude, Sir Ralph ! 

SIR RALPH, guarded, blank. 

Gratitude for what ? 

LADY BASSET, secure. 

The devotion you promised. 

SIR RALPH, impatient. 

Oh, damn the devotion ! 

LADY BASSET, resentful. 

You withhold it ? 

SIR RALPH, looking at her hard a moment ; then politic, accommodatbg. 

To your very good health ! (He drains down the cup, under her 
eye, with submission, then hands it summarily back to her ; after which she 
goes up to put it down and Maud descends on the other side with a plate of 
bread and butter.) She haS drugged it ! (Then very sarcastic, as 
Maud offers him her bread and butter.) What have I promised 

youl 

MAUD, sad, sentimental. 

Nothing, alas ! 

SIR RALPH, turning unceremoniously away from her. 

Then I decline your poison ! 

He crosses to the other side of the stage, as if to break with her for ever, and she, 
checked in her overture, discouraged, goes up again with her plate. Teddy 
AsHDOWN meanwhile has re-entered from the street with his purchase, which 
he lays down on table before the others ; coming down immediately after to 
Sir Ralph. 



AGT SECOND 121 

TEDDY, giving Sir Ralph a sixpence and coppers. 

The change. 

SIR RALPH, looking at the money. 

Elevenpence ? 

TEDDY. 

Tenpence ! 

He goes up while Sir Ralph pockets the money, and as he rejoins the others 
Grace Jbsmond, who has drunk her tea and turned away from the table, 
stands looking an instant at Sir Ralph. Then she comes down to him while 
Bernal, who has noticed her movement, continues to observe her 

GRACE, with veiled irony, to Sir Ralph. 

Immensely graceful of you to sit ! 

SIR RALPH, with decision. 

I shall not sit ! — I object to the conditions ! 

GRACE, with repressed emotion. 

Youll not keep faith ? 

SIR RALPH. 

It's he who has broken it ! 

GRACE. 

I beg you to accept the conditions. 

SIR RALPH. 

Accept you as one of them ? 

GRACE, feeling the impertinence, the insult of this ; then quickly controlling 
herself ; with a smile. 

Am I one of the worst, Sir Ralph ? 



122 THE ALBUM 

SIR RALPH. 
The worst for his job ! 

GRACE, considering. 

I should be very sorry to injure Mr. Bernal. 

SIR RALPH. 

You do awfully, you know, by your conduct. 

GRACE, still wondering. 

In what manner can I modify it ? 

SIR RALPH. 
By ceasing to spring up in my path ! 

GRACE, smiling. 

I only spring up to check your retreat ! 

SIR RALPH, demurring to the term. 

My "retreat"? 

GRACE. 

From your agreement to assist Mr. Bernal. (After an 
instant.) Mr. Bcmal needs assistance. 

SIR RALPH, curt, impatient. 

Why on earth should he ? 

GRACE, indicating the whole place. 

Look about you and see ! 



ACT SECOND 123 

SIR RALPH, after a glance. 

I see a lot of women! — Mark likes 'em! (Then after an 
instant.) I'll sit if he*ll clear the place. 

GRACE. 

He will — of those ladies. 

SIR RALPH, sharp. 

But not of you ? 

GRACE. 

If he turns me out he'll separate me — (Pausing, significantly 

hesitating.) 

SIR RALPH. 

Separate you — ? 

GRACE, smiling. 

From you, Sir Ralph ! 

SIR RALPH. 
That's exactly what I demand ! (Turning away from her, he 
crosses to the other side of the stage.) I say, Mark I (Then on Bernal's 

coming down as Gracb goes up.) You'll have to take that girl 
by the shoulders ! (On Bernal's biankness.) To put her out. 

BERNAL, thinking, demurring, while he looks at Sir Ralph. 

I'm more and more struck with her charm ! 

SIR RALPH, as if scandalised. 

Her charm ? 

BERNAL. 

Her spirit, her cleverness, her character ! The more 
you've reason to dread her the more she needs my eye ! 



124 THE ALBUM 

SIR RALPH. 

Your eye can rest a bit I let you off. 

BERNAL. 

It's a joy as well as a duty ! 

SIR RALPH. 

Your joy should be to paint my portrait, and to clear 
the place for the purpose. 

BERNAL, prompt. 

I'll clear it ! (Then to the others.) As I must get to work 
with Sir Ralph I beg my pupils to retire ! 

LADY BASSET, resentful. 

Without seeing your method ? 

BERNAL, bending over her hand, kissing it in farewell. 

This, dear lady, is my method ! (Then urging her up to the 

parlour with Maud.) Put On yOUr loVCly things ! (Indicating all 

the tea-things.) Teddy, rcmovc ! 

LADY BASSET, at door of the parlour ; to Bbrnal. 

Begin — while I dress ! 

Exit Lady Basset. 
MAUD, to Sir Ralph, at the door of parlour. 

That takes her an hour ! 

Exit Maud Vannbck, while Teddy Ashdown, gathering up the tea-things, 
goes out with them to the kitchen and Sir Ralph, with bare patience, sits 
rigidly detached on the sofa under the window. 



ACT SECOND 125 

GRACE, to Bernal. 

Do you begin immediately ? 

SIR RALPH, resolute. 

We don't begin till youVe gone. 

GRACE, to Bernal. 

Before I go I should like to speak to Sir Ralph. 

SIR RALPH, rising in dismay. 

Again, Madam ? 

GRACE, to Bernal. . 

If you'll give me the fortunate chance. 

BERNAL. 

Do you mean alone ? 

GRACE, smiling. 

I mean alone ! 

BERNAL, who has looked at her hard an instant ; mj'stified, perplexed, tor- 
mented by everything that appears to give colour to Sir Ralph's account 
of her. 

Shall I leave you, Ralph ? 

SIR RALPH, falling back helpless and hopeless on the sofa. 

I meet my doom 1 

BERNAL, at the street-door, having taken up his hat and holding up an 
empty tube of oilcolour. 

There's a chap next door — I'll borrow some blue ! 

Exit Mark Bernal. 



126 THE ALBUM 

GRACE, who has taken up from the table where Bbrnal has placed it after 
tearing out the leaf the album of Act First. 

Allow me to ask (after an instant, while she looks at the book) if yOuVe 

ever seen this. 

SIR RALPH, from the sofa, with his glass. 

That ? 

GRACE, holding out the album. 

This sketchbook. 

SIR RALPH, struck, then slowly rising. 

Seen it? — Where? 

GRACE. 

At Courtlands — the hour you arrived. 

SIR RALPH. 

How can I remember what I saw the hour I arrived ? 

GRACE. 

Mr. Ashdown can remember. He told me. 

SIR RALPH, startled, staring. 

Told you ? 

GRACE. 

Half an hour later. That you had seen Mr. Bernal's 
name. 

SIR RALPH. 

His name — where ? 

GRACE, handing him the album. 

On that page — with that date. 



ACT SECOND 127 

SIR RALPH, with the album ; looking hard an instant at the page ; then 
hard an instant at Grace. 

I believe 1 have. What then ? 

GRACE. 

You denied it — in my own presence. (Then after an insunt.) 
You denied it to the Vicar. 

SIR RALPH, after looking at the book again, chucking it away as if with 
indignant impatience. 

What the devil are you talking about ? 

GRACE. 

About the great wrong you were guilty of. You deceived 
a dying man — you robbed a living. 

SIR RALPH. 
Living ? I didn't dream he was living ! 

GRACE. 
It seems to me that book might have made you dream ! 

SIR RALPH. 

It would if I had seen it in time. 

GRACE. 

You did see it in time — in time to show it to Mr. 
Ashdown. 

SIR RALPH, staring, as if recalling. 

That was after the Vicar — 



128 THE ALBUM 

GRACE, as he just hesitates. 

Had put you that solemn question? No, Sir Ralph, 
Mr. Ashdown has satisfied me that it was before. 

SIR RALPH. 

Satisfied you ? How ? 

GRACE 

By his comparison of notes with me, and by his positive 
declaration. 

SIR RALPH. 

His positive declaration's a lie. 

GRACE, after an instant. 

Will you say that to him f 

SIR RALPH. 

With all the pleasure in life ! 

GRACE, passing to the kitchen. 

Then 111 call him to hear it ! 

SIR RALPH, as she reaches the door. 
A moment, Madam. (Then after an instant abrupt, as she stops with 
her hand on the latch.) What is it yOU Want ? 

GRACE, vague an instant 

Want? 

SIR RALPH. 

To let me alone. (As she leaves the door.) 1 askcd you that, 
you know, at Courtlands. 



ACT SECOND 129 

GRACE. 
Yes, and I told you to guess. 

SIR RALPH, after an inslant. 

I couldn't guess so soon. 

GRACE. 

Can you guess at present ? 

SIR RALPH, after consideration. 

Fifty pounds ? 

GRACE, echoing, stupefied. 

Fifty pounds ? 

SIR RALPH. 
Not enough ? A hundred ? (Then at a loss ; as she only stands 
looking at him.) It's UOt mouey ? (As if with a fuller vision of the real 
question and his inevitable fate.) It's the Other thing ? 

GRACE, back at the kitchen, while Mark Bbrnal reappears. 

It's the other thing ! 

Exit Grace Jbsmond. 
SIR RALPH, aghast, fatalistic, to htniself, as Bernal comes in. 

Marriage ! 

Re-enter Mark Bernal from the street. 

BERNAL, struck, arrested by Sir Ralph's appearance and discomposure ; 
speaking with the note of real anxiety. 

She has proposed ? 

SIR RALPH, throwing up his arms from his sides and letting them fall. 

She has proposed ! 

VOL. II K 



I30 THE ALBUM 

BERNAL, dismayed, credulous. 

And youVe accepted ? 

SIR RALPH. 

IVe asked for a minute 1 

BERNAL, wonderstruck, turning it over. 

A minute? 

SIR RALPH. 

To decide — to think 1 

BERNAL, uneasy, painfully mystified ; throwing himself quickly, in the 
interest of delay, of diversion, into the question of the portrait ; shifting 
his easeL 

That's it — ^you'll decide at your ease ; you'll think while 
you sit ! 

SIR RALPH. 
T\\ be hanged if I'll sit ! (Then after an instant, while Bbrnal 
stares with dismay.) At any rate not here. (As Teddy reappears : 
re-enter Teddy Ashdown from the kitchen.) I'll sit at home. 

TEDDY, surprised, ejaculating. 

At home ? 

SIR RALPH, looking very hard at Teddy. 

At home. 



TEDDY, mystified, bewildered by the way Sir Ralph glares at him, 
fascinatedly returns his stare ; then to Bernal. 



May I go out ? 



ACT SECOND 131 

SIR RALPH, precipitately interposing. 

Go out ? Never ! 

BERNAL, surprised, pleading. 

Dear Ralph, it's his day ! 

SIR RALPH, in alarm. 
His " day '' ? (Then, while the two ladies reappear ; as if everything is 
overwhelmingly against him.) Mercy Ofl US ! 

Re-enter Lady Bassbt and Maud Vannbck from the parlour, dressed for 
departure. 

TEDDY, delighted. 
I'll go with them I (Then to the ladies, indicating Sir Ralph.) 

He'll sit at home ! 

LADY BASSET. 
At hOD[ie ? ((^ming down to Sir Ralph, who, on the right,^has collapsed 

upon the sofa.) I shall bc there ! 

Exit Lady Basset to the street, the door to which Bbrnal holds open. 
MAUD, coming down to Sir Ralph ; disgusted. 

I shall noil 

She goes up as Bernal comes down, and is received by Teddy, who offers her 
his arm. Exeunt Teddy Ashdown and Maud Vannbck to the street. 

SIR RALPH, who has sat engulfed in reflections, wholly heedless of what the 
two women have said to him, rises grave and pale ; then to Bernal. 

IVe decided ! 

BERNAL. eager. 

You refuse ? 



132 THE ALBUM 

SIR RALPH, I 



I accept! 

BERNAL,« 
On the spot ? 

SIR RALPH. 
It's to come ! (Uftbig and droppatg his aias to his sides as before.) 
Z^/ It come ! (Then as Gkack reappean : re-enter Gkacb Jbsmond 
from the kitchen, dressed to ga) MisS JCSmOIld ! 

BERN AL, still more alert, antidpatrng, interposing. 

Miss Jesmond ! 

SIR RALPH, while Gkacb, surprised, ancsfced by the intensity of Bbknal's 
tooe, stands looking from one of the men to the other. 

I've something to say to you. 

BERNAL, strenuous, insistent, with a gravity and anxiety altogether new, like 
his whole aspect and manner in what follows. 

Tvt something to say first ! 

GRACE, uncertain. 

To mf, Mr. Bemal ? 

BERNAL, indicating Ralph. 

To him ! (Then very urgent.) While I say it will you kindly 
wait? 

GRACE, stiU more vague. 

Wait? 

BERN AL, who has opened the door of the parlour. 

In there! (Gracb hesitates an instant, looking in the same wondering per- 
plexity from one of the men to the other. Then, after resting her eyes intensely 
on Bbrnal's, she abruptly decides and goes quickly into the parlour. Bbrnal 



ACT SECOND 133 

closes the door on her and, with his eyes on Sir Ralph, stands a moment holding 
the handle. Then coming down with decision, and with the rising passion of all 

his doubt m the question.) That girl — after your fortune ? 

SIR RALPH. 

After my fortune— -End (hesitating an instant, as if in resentment at 
that's being thought his only attraction, while he smartly taps his breast) 

after me! 

BERNAL, worried, frowning, challenging, incredulous. 

You say she proposed ? 

SIR RALPH, very definite. 

She made me an offer ! 

BERNAL. 

But of what ? 

SIR RALPH. 

Why, of her hand — and her person. 

BERNAL, amazed. 

You didn't understand her ! 

SIR RALPH. 

It was painfully clear. 

BERNAL, after an instant. 

My dear Ralph — I don't believe it ! 

SIR RALPH, after another instant. 

You impute to me — ^misrepresentation ? 



134 THE ALBUM 

BERNAL. 
I impute to you — ^aberration ! (Tben as if he can't get over it.) 

You intend to marry her ? 

SIR RALPH, fully detennbed ; as if with the resignation of the highest 
wisdom and enlightenment. 

It will keep her quiet ! 

BERNAL, dissuaave, ironic 

An intrigante— oi a dangerous type ? 

SIR RALPH, demonstrating his cleverness. 

I conjure the danger away ! 

BERNAL, almost derisive. 

A hungry adventuress ? 

SIR RALPH. 
I thought you contested that ! (Then as Bernal, in his agitation, 

moves nervously away.) She has beauty — and mind ! 

BERNAL, echoing, realising. 
Beauty and mind ! (Then in a different tone, with high decision.) 

My dear fellow, you mustn't do it ! 

SIR RALPH, irritated at his opposition. 

To oblige you f 

BERNAL, after an instant. 

To oblige me ! 

SIR RALPH. 

Pray, are you in love with her ? 



ACT SECOND 135 

BERNAL, evasive. 
If I am, it's your fault (As ifU settles the matter.) YoU told 

me to be ! 

SIR RALPH, positive. 

I told you to pull up ! 

BERNAL. 

It was too late to pull up — ^and it's too late now. 

SIR RALPH, more uneasy, suspicious, wondering. 

Now? 

BERNAL, smiling. 

I want to keep on ! 

SIR RALPH,. in still deeper disapproval and alarm. 

Paying your court ? 

BERNAL. 

Paying my court ! 

SIR RALPH. 

To make her your wife ? 

BERNAU 
To make her (in deep uncertainty, agitation, distraction, faltering) I'll 

be hanged if I know what ! 

SIR RALPH, as if following up an advantage and looking about him in 
reprobation. 

The partner of your misery ? 

BERNAL, in despair, troubled, impatient compunction. 

Yes Pm too deadly poor ! (Then after an instant, with returning 

clearness and resolution.) But I do kuOW what I Want. I 

want to prevent you ! 



136 THE ALBUM 

SIR RALPH, wound up, taking up the challenge. 
You shan't prevent me ! (Then at the door of the parlour, which he 
has quickly opened.) MisS Jesmond ! 

BERNAL, as quickly opening the door to the street, while Grace reappears. 

Miss Jesmond ! 

Re-enter Grace Jesmond. 
SIR RALPH, pressing. 

Will you do me a favour ? 

BERNAL, forestalling her answer ; passionate. 

Will you do me one first ? 

GRACE, still more mystified by their heated aspect ; looking from one to the 
other and then addressing Bernau 

Anything — for you / 

BERNAL. 

Then walk out of the house ! 

GRACE, startled, pained, for the moment, by the manner of the request. 

Out of the house — ? 

BERNAL, feverishly peremptory ; pointing to the open door. 

This moment ! 

GRACE, looking once more from one of the men to the other as they stand on 
either side of the stage ; then, with a visible effort, deciding and sadly, 
supremely addressing Bernal. 

Good-bye ! 

Exit Grace Jesmond, while the two men stand defiantly confronted. 



ACT THIRD 

Sir Ralph Damant's drawng-room in Portland Place ; hand- 
some, cold, conventional and characteristic. A door at the centre 
from the hall and staircase ; doors right and left from other reception 
rooms. 

Gracb Jbsmond is seated in her hat and cape ; not the same garments as in 
Act Second, but, as to mourning, perceptibly modified and brightened. The 
Footman who has appeared in Act First enters from the hall. 

FOOTMAN. 

I find Sir Ralph is not at home, Miss; but he gave 
orders that if you should call you were to be particularly 
asked to wait. 

GRACE. 

Till he comes in ? 

FOOTMAN. 

He may be expected at any moment. 

GRACE, after an instant. 

When were these orders given ? 

FOOTMAN. 

On Thursday, Miss, on our return from Vandyke Lodge. 

(Then expansive, as if glad of an opportunity to converse.) I waS there 

with the carriage — and I joined in the chase. 



138 THE ALBUM 

GRACE, struck. 

The chase ? 

FOOTMAN. 

For you, Miss. Sir Ralph drove hard — to catch up 
with you. 

GRACE, after an .instant; quiet. 

He didn't catch up. 

FOOTMAN, smUing. 

We had wasted precious moments. 

GRACE. 

You mustn't waste them now. 

FOOTMAN. 

He remarked that you'd turn up ! 

GRACE, after reflection. 

Since I'm expected, I'll wait. 

FOOTMAN, increasingly sociable. 

We've another party in another room. 

GRACE, rising, wondering. 

Another party ? 

FOOTMAN. 

From Vandyke Lodge. 

GRACE, startled, changing her mind. 

I believe, after all, I won't wait ! 



ACT THIRD 139 



FOOTMAN, as Tkddy appears. 

Here's the other party. 



Oh! 



Enter Teddy Ash down from the right 
GRACE, dropping into her chair again with relief. 



TEDDY, much pleased. 

You're just the person I want I 

FOOTMAN, privately; ironical. 

All of 'em ? Gracious ! 

Exit the Footman to the hall. 
GRACE, rising again ; anxious. 

Is Mr. Bernal here ? 

TEDDY. 

He'd be if he suspected you are ! I'm looking for him, 
and he's looking for Miss Jesmond. 

GRACE. 

He's coming for the portrait ? 

TEDDY. 

By appointment. They've patched it up. 

GRACE, vague. 

The portrait ? 

TEDDY. 

Oh no — their quarrel ! 

GRACE, still vague. 

Their quarrel ? 



140 THE ALBUM 

TEDDY. 
About you ! I know what happened. 



GRACE. 
That's more than I do, Mr. Ashdown ! 

TEDDY. 

Then I'll tell you. 

GRACE, postponing. 

When does Mr. Bemal come ? 

TEDDY, looking at his watch. 

Not till twelve. He put me on a 'bus with the traps — 
they're all in there, (indicating the adjoining room.) He's 
walking to save the fare. 

GRACE. 

Then he'll take some time ? - 

TEDDY. 

He crawls along — because he looks out for you in the 
streets. He peeps under every bonnet ! He has sent 
me to all those fellows for news of you. 

GRACE. 

The artists ? I've been to none of them. 

TEDDY. 

He said you'd require to go. 

GRACE. 
I do " require " ! (Then after an instant.) But I dou't gO. 



ACT THIRD - 141 

TEDDY, after a moment. 

You come here instead. 

GRACE. 
I come here instead. 

TEDDY. 

But not, I fear, for Mark. 

GRACE. 

Not for Mr. Bernal. For Sir Ralph Damant 

TEDDY, after another moment. 

Was it for Sir Ralph you came to us ? 
GRACE. 

It was for myself. 

TEDDY. 

That was what their row was about — when Mark was so 
rude. 

GRACE. 
How rude was Mr. Bernal ? 

TEDDY. 

Rude enough to repent ! , He has repented fearfully of 
what he did to you. 

GRACE, after an instant. 

He asked me to leave his house. 

TEDDY. 

Oh, he has told me ; he talks of nothing else ! 



142 THE ALBUM 

GRACE. 
I've talked of it — to no one. 

TEDDY, alert. 

Then you've forgiven him ? 

GRACE, with the same smile. 

I've forgiven him. 

TEDDY, with the same eagerness. 

May I tell him, when he comes ? 

GRACE, after an instant. 

IVe asked you before to keep a secret. 

TEDDY. 
About that sketch-book? (With emphatic satisfaction.) I've 

kept it ! 

GRACE. 

Beautifully. Then keep this one. 

TEDDY, vague. 

Your forgiving him ? 

GRACE. 

My being in this place. I wish not to see him. 

TEDDY, perceptibly mystified. 

And yet you remain ? 



ACT THIRD 143 

GRACE. 

Only for one reason, — that if I go now I shall not have 
courage to return. 

TEDDY. 
"Courage"? 

GRACE. 

It was not easy ! 

TEDDY. 

To face Sir Ralph ? Why, / have to ! 

GRACE, after a moment. 

Yes — you have to. 

TEDDY. 

I do it for Mark ! 

GRACE, after an instant ; with her tired smile. 

And / do it for " Mark " ! To render him a service. 

TEDDY, eager. 

Then you like hira ? 

GRACE, hesitating, but still smiling. 

You ask too many questions 1 

TEDDY. 

I asked that one because he likes you 

GRACE. 

I guessed so when he turned me out. 



144 THE ALBUM 

TEDDY. 
Did you ? He has been afraid you wouldn't ! 

GRACE. 
I didn't at first But then I thought about it. 

TEDDY, sympathetically interested. 

And then it came to you ? 

GRACE. 

Little by little. (After a moment.) It Came to me last night. 

TEDDY. 

And that brought you here ? 

GRACE. 

Early, as you see. To acknowledge his favour ! 

TEDDY. 

But how — ^if you don't meet him ? 

GRACE. 

I shall meet Sir Ralph. 

TEDDY, alert. 

Meet him and refuse him ? 



GRACE, consciously blank. 

" Refuse " him ? 



TEDDY, surprised at her blankness. 

Doesn't he want to marry you ? 



ACT THIRD 145 

GRACE, grave. 

Quite the contrary ! 

TEDDY. 

And you don't want it ? 

GRACE, with controlled emotion ; after an instant. 

Has he asserted that ? 

TEDDY. 

To Mark — on Thursday. You made him an offer. 

GRACE, rising quickly. 

Which he saw reason to accept — precisely ! 

TEDDY. 

It was why Mark banished you. To separate the parties 
— to avert the danger ! 

GRACE. 
To prevent Sir Ralph's accepting ? 

TEDDY. 

To choke him right off! 

GRACE, eager. 

Mr. Bernal believed it ? 

TEDDY, vague. 

That Sir Ralph would? 

VOL. II L 



146 THE ALBUM 

GRACE. 
No — ^that I had done such a thing. 

TEDDY, after an instant's reflectioo. 

It didn't prevent him from wanting you — 

GRACE, as he modestly pauses. 

" Wanting " me ? 

TEDDY. 

For his own use ! 

GRACE, dropping into a seat again ; sitting there an instant in thought : then 
rising and with frankness and courage, as well as with a forced gaiety in- 
tended to dissimulate her sadness and make her discussion of such a matter 
with Teddy pass. 

Mr. Bernal may "want" me, Mr. Ashdown; but Mr. 
Bernal can't have me 1 

TEDDY, vague, disappointed. 

Can't have you ? 

GRACE. 

It ties my hands. 

TEDDY, hlank. 

I don't understand I 

GRACE. 

I do — at last ! I had thought it all out — but you 
greatly help me. 

TEDDY, kind, simple, loyal. 

I want to greatly help you. 

GRACE. 

You did so, you know, at Courtlands. 



ACT THIRD 147 

TEDDY. 
By holding my tongue ? It was hard ! 

GRACE. 
I shall set you to-day an easier task. You will be so 
good as to speak. 

TEDDY, alert. 

Tell Mr. Bemal— ? 

GRACE, tnterrnpciiig. 

That Fm in the house. 

TEDDY. 

But where shall you be ? 

GRACE, at a momentary loss ; looking round her, then pointing to the door 
on the left. 

In there. 

TEDDY. 

Why not in here ? 

GRACE. 

So you may prepare him. 

TEDDY, blank. 

" Prepare " him ? 

GRACE. 

Give him his choice — of seeing me or not. 

TEDDY, laughing. 

He'll take it ! (Then more gravely.) And if I speak for you, 
will you speak for me ? 



I4S THE ALBUM 

GRACE. 



To whom ? 

TEDDY. 

To " dear Maud." I want her — for my own use ! 



GRACE. ! 

ni approach her — ^if I've a chance. 

TEDDY, with resolutkm. 

I'll make you one ! 

Re-«nter the Footman &amp;om the halL 
FOOTMAN, to Grace. 

Mr. BemaL 

GRACE, startled. 

Coming up ? 

FOOTMAN, who has crossed to the door on the left, which he has opened. 

If you'll pass in there. 

TEDDY, anxious, while Grace reaches the other room. 

Can I trust you ? 

GRACE, at the door, with a smile. 

If you can trust her ! 

Exit Grace Jesmono to the left. 
FOOTMAN, explaining, after closing the door on her. 

Sir Ralph's orders. 

^TEDDY, vague. 

His orders ? 



ACT THIRD 149 

FOOTMAN. 
If Mr. Bemal should come. 

TEDDY, disconcerted. 

He's not to see her ? 

FOOTMAN, self-complacent, responsible. 

For fear of complications ! 

TEDDY, disgusted ; thinking. 

Why, what does Sir Ralph call that^ (Then seeing Bernal,) 
Silence ! 

Enter Mark Bbknal from the hall. Exit the Footman to the hall. 
BERNAL. 

Ralph's not here ? 

TEDDY. 

I've been waiting. 

BERNAL. 

With everything ready ? 

Teddy, embarrassed, at fault. 

Not yet ; I thought — 

BERNAL, breaking in ; with kindly impatience. 

You think too much you always did I (Then indicating the 

door on the right.) Be quick ! 

TEDDY, demurring, hesitating. 

Before I go —

BERNAL, as he pauses. 

Before you go ? 

TEDDY. 

Miss Jesmond's in the house 1

Here ? — ^now ? 

TEDDY. 

She told me to tell you. 

BERNAL. eager. 

Then I can see her ? 

TEDDY. 

You can see her. 

BERNAL, struck, in the midst of his relief ; mistrustful, wondering. 

But what's she doing ? 

TEDDY, vague. 

Doing ? 

BERNAL. 

For what purpose has she come ? 

TEDDY. 

For the purpose of helping you. 

BERNAL, blank. 

But how in the world — ? 

TEDDY. 

I give it up ! 



ACT THIRD 151 

BERNAL, uneasy, peremptory ; suddenly nervous and discomposed ; passing 
hb hand over his head. 

Make ready ! 

Re-enter, as he speaks, the Footman from the hall. 
SERVANT, announcing. 

Lady Basset ! 

BERNAL, starting, as if strudc with a quick idea, then still more imperative, to 
Tbddy, who has lingered, looking at him, with a hand on the door at 
the right. 

Leave us ! 



E^it Tbddy Ashdown to the right. Enter Lady Basset from the hall. 
Exit the Footman. 



BERNAL, as if amused. 

How did you get in ? 

LADY BASSET. 

The butler passed me up. Uubiiant, exultant.) Tm invited ! 

BERNAL. 

By Sir Ralph ? 

LADY BASSET. 

By Sir Ralph. (Triumphant.) He wants me ! 

BERNAL, surprised. 

For what ? 

LADY BASSET, with.lively confidence. 

You'll see when he comes ! 



152 THE ALBUM 

BERNAL. 
But he doesn't come ! (Looking at hu watch.) You must 
help me to bear it 

LADY BASSET, self-complacent, coquettish. 

I helped you, you know, to bear it the other day ! 

BERNAL, preoccupied with the idea of Grace's presence. 

Indeed you did — immensely ! 

LADY BASSET. 

We had recourse to my artistic nature. 

BERNAL, vague. 

Do you wish to have recourse to it again ? 

LADY BASSET, after serious reflection. 
Not to the same extent. (Then with serenity and lucidity.) If 

I was present the other day as an artist, I'm present 
to-day as a woman. 

BERNAL, with the same vagueness as before. 

Is it in that capacity he has sent for you ? 

LADY BASSET, bUnk. 

In what other capacity, pray — ? (After an instant.) The 
very servants recognise it ! 

BERNAL, not following. 

Recognise it — ? 

LADY BASSET. 

By their eagerness to usher me in ! 



ACT THIRD 153 

BERNAL, suddenly struck ; wkh a light. 

In here — to me^ 

LADY BASSET, vague, surprised at the point he makes of this. 

They mentioned I should find you 1 

BERNAL, as the fuller light breaks upon him ; with amused elation ; 
seizing her arm. 

That's what he wanted of you ! 

LADY BASSET, blank, disconcerted. 

To amuse you ? 

BERNAL. 

To captivate me — as he wants me to captivate you ! 

LADY BASSET, candid, jovial. 

You do, my dear man ! 

BERNAL, Uughing. 

And so do you ! 

LADY BASSET. 

But why does Sir Ralph desire it ? 

BERNAL 

To protect himself. He fears you. 

LADY BASSET, exultant. 

I feel that he does ! 

BERNAL, amused and relieved by his discovery. 

I see it all ! 



154 THE ALBUM 

LADY BASSET. 
All what ? 

BERNAL. 

Why, he means you to draw me off ! 

LADY BASSET, vague. 

Off somebody else ? 

BERNAL, smUing. 

A person he wants for himself! 

LADY BASSET, struck, alarmed. 

For himself? (Then with quick dismay.) Maud Vanneck ? 

BERNAL, amused. 

No, not Maud Vanneck. 

LADY BASSET, thinking ; then with eager intensity. 

Grace Jesmond ? 

BERNAL. 

She's in the house I 

LADY BASSET, still more alarmed. 

Invited ? 

BERNAL. 

No, not invited — he hasn't her address. 

LADY BASSET. 

She has come of herself? 

BERNAL, after an instant, as if recognising the full gravity of this. 

She has come of herself. 



ACT THIRD I5S 

LADY BASSET, stupefied, scandalised. 

What effrontery ! 

BERNAL. 
Her reason is doubtless good. 

LADY BASSET, as if struck with the tone in which he says this. 

You're in love with her ? 

BERNAL. 

Ralph thinks so. 

LADY BASSET, imperative. 

Then for God's sake marry her ! 

BERNAL, after an instant ; troubled, sincere. 

How can I — ^in my position ? 

LADY BASSET, coinciding. 

Yes — she's after money. (Then with decision.) But she won't 
get it ! 

BERNAU 

Do you mean that you will ? 

LADY BASSET, after an instant. 

Sir Ralph is pledged to me. 

BERNAL, uncertain, bewildered, nervous. 

Then why does he want her ? 

LADY BASSET, blank a moment ; then with resentment. 

Because he's false !

BERNAL, pleading:. 

Ah, no — ^he's honest ! (After an instant.) See .how he makes 
us meet ! 

LADY BASSET. 

You and me ? 

BERNAL. 

For you to swallow me up 1 

LADY BASSET, impressed with the unsuspected truth. 

And you to swallow me f 

BERNAL, smiling. 

So that you won't have room (or him/ (After an instant.) 
You admitted just now that there wasn't much ! 

LADY BASSET, with decision. 

You're a very brilliant man, but I reject you. 

BERNAL. 

Ralph has counted on your appreciating me enough — 

(Hesitating, pausing, as if with a last scruple ; then in a changed tone.) Hang 

it — I can tell you now / 

LADY BASSET, eager. 

To let Sir Ralph off? 

BERNAL. 

To be merciful. 

LADY BASSET. 

For the benefit of that creature ? Never ! 

BERNAL 

You really hold out ? 



ACT THIRD 157 

LADY BASSET. 

Against you ? I loathe you ! 

BERNAL. 

And you permit me to loathe back ? 

LADY BASSET. 

If you love another woman ! 

BERNAL. 

I haven't told you I do ! 

LADY BASSET. 

That's because you're such a flirt. You won't part with 
one victim — 

BERNAL, laughing, intemipting. 
Before I make sure of another ? (Then again preoccupied.) 

Yes, I must make sure. (After an instant.) And while I'm 
making sure — 

LADY BASSET. 

/ shall be doing the same ! 

BERNAL, amused. 

You'll be all there ? 

LADY BASSET, with clear resolution. 

All here ! 

BERNAL, after a moment's intense reflection ; going up to the bell, 
which he ring . 

I must see my way ! 



158 THE ALBUM 

LADY BASSET, T»guc 

What are you doing? 

BERNAL. 
I'm making sure ! (Re-enter the Footman from the halL To the 

Footman.) Am I correct in believing that Miss Jesmond's 
in the house ? 

FOOTMAN, embarrassed. 

Did the young gentleman tell you, sir ? 

BERNAL. 
Of course the young gentleman told me. 

FOOTMAN. 

Would it do for me, then, to deny it ? 

BERNAL, staring. 

Deny it ? Why should you deny it ? 

FOOTMAN. 

Because Sir Ralph said she wasn't to see you. 

BERNAL, struck ; then with high decision. 

Then he should be at home to prevent it ! 

FOOTMAN. 

He may be at any moment, sir. 

BERNAL. 

Then I must see her quickly ! 



ACT THIRD 159 

FOOTMAN, 
ril inform her. 

Exit the Footman to the left, leaving the door open. 
LADY BASSET. 

She can scarcely be said to shrink ! 

BERNAL, amused. 

If you compare it with your shrinkage ! 

LADY BASSET. 

Mine, such as it is, forbids me to witness your en- 
counter ! 

BERNAL, indicating the room on the right. 

Then kindly pass in there. 

LADY BASSET, vaguely demurring. 

In there ? 

BERNAL. 

Where Sir Ralph's to sit. 

LADY BASSET, at the door, alert. 

ru wait for him ! 

Exit Lady Basset to the right. Re-enter Grace Jesmond from the left. 
GRACE, pausing where she enters. 

I asked Mr. Ashdown to tell you of my presence — 
strange as it must inevitably appear to you. 



i6o THE ALBUM 

BERNAL. 
As your presence must appear ? 

GRACK 

No — as my request to him must. 

BERNAL. 

In the light of the extraordinary leave I last asked you 
to take of me ? If s to explain that monstrous proceed- 
ing that I have begged for these words with you. IVe 
hunted for you hard, but in vain — to make you hear 
them. 

GRACE. 

There is a word I myself should like to speak. (After an 
instont) The simple request to you to believe — 

BERNAL, waiting, as she pauses. 

To believe ? 

GRACE. 

Nothing Sir Ralph Damant may say of me. 

BERNAL. 

You're aware then of what he has in fact said ? 

GRACE. 

It's because I think I divine it that IVe come here. 

BERNAL, after an instant. 

Not, I suppose, at his request. 

GRACE. 

He couldn't request me — in ignorance of where to find 
me. 



ACT THIRD i6i 

BERNAL. 
The ignorance youVe me to thank for ! 

GRACE. 

As I do thank you, Mr. Bernal. 

BERNAL. 

You thank me for showing you the door, for turning you 
out of my house ? — ^turning you without mercy into the 
great city you had scoured in vain, and in which I 
myself soon enough cursed the folly that had deprived 
me of a possible clue to you ? 

GRACE. 

We meet again in spite of that folly. 

BERNAL. 

We meet again in spite of it. (Then after an instant.) But we 
meet again in a manner to which it would take but little 
more of my perplexity to make me prefer our separation. 

GRACE, after a hesitation. 

Is that because you do believe Sir Ralph ? 

BERNAL. 

If he has told me a strange story of you, why do you, 
on your side, take a step which gives a detestable 
colour to it ? 

GRACE. 

This step of coming to see him ? Because it's the only 
way to say to him — something that I have to say. 

VOL. II « M 



i62 THE ALBUM 

BERNAU 

IVe no right whatever to ask you what that may be. 

GRACE. 

IVe a limited power, none the less, to tell you. He has 
misunderstood me ; and it is important to me that he 
should be informed that he has. 

BERNAL. 
Important ? (Then after an instant, half-impatient, half-pleading.) Ah, 

why is it important ? 

GRACE, hesitating, momentarily embarrassed. 

Fm afraid I can only say to you — because I hold it to be ! 

BERNAL, with an apo]&lt;^etic, penitent gesture. 

I insult you with my curiosity when I only wanted to 
convince you of my regret. • It was my respect for you 
the other day, that made me use a freedom ! 

GRACE. 
The sense of that respect consoles me ! 

BERNAL 

I'm delighted to hear it ; but what's to console me ? 

GRACE, after an instant. 

For what, Mr. Bernal ? 



ACT THIRD 163 

BERNAl. 
For seeing Sir Ralph Damant again stand between us ! 

GRACE, after another instant. 

Excuse me if I don't perceive how it should matter to 
you where Sir Ralph Damant stands. 

BERNAL. 

You saw how it mattered the other day ! 

GRACE, quiet. 
I saw the fact, but not the reason. (Then with a sad smile.) 

You ask me, I think, for more explanations than you 
give ! 

BERNAL, admitting this ; speaking very kindly. 

You must be generous with me, for I'm much troubled. 

GRACE. 

It's because you're much troubled that I*m here. (Then 

while he stares ; explaining.) J saw yOUr pOOr home the Other 

day, and I heard your confession. 

BERNAL, struck, alert. 

Of want of means ? 

GRACE, tender, indulgent. 

My intrusion, my appeal brought it out. 

BERNAL. 

So that you're here for money ? 



i64 THE ALBUM 

GRACE, after an instant. 

I'm here for money ! 

BERNAL, wondering, amazed. 

For my relief? 

GRACE, after another pause. 

Are you too proud to accept relief? 

BERNAU 

If I'm proud at all, Miss Jesmond, I'm proud of having 
inspired — by such an accident — such a sympathy ! 

(After an instant.) Your charity is (hesiuting for his word ; then bring- 
ing it out with an extravagance of warmth in which there is just a shade of the 
irony of his imperfect credulity, his sense of strangeness) magnificent ! • 

GRACE, gentle. 

Such as it is, it's all my motive ! 

BERNAL, going on. 

Still more rriagnificent is your belief in my cousin's 
sensibility. 

GRACE. 

You mean it's extravagant ? (After an instant.) It would be 
— ^if I hadn't grounds for it. 

BERNAL, struck. 

Grounds ? (then after reflection.) Shall I Strike you as the 
most graceless of men if I venture to ask what they are ? 

GRACE. 

I can't tell you, Mr. Bernal, what they are ! 



ACT THIRD 165 

BERNAL. 

And yet you said just now that you give more explana- 
tions — 

GRACE, as he hesitates. 
Than you do ? (After an instant.) I waS WFOUg. (With pathetic 

dignity.) I fecl that I don't give enough ! 

BERNAL, worried, agitated, almost feverish. 

You give enough to enchant me, but not enough to 
satisfy ! Why should you wish to remedy my preposter- 
ous predicament? 

GRACE. 

Because I regret it ! 

BERNAL, with the same troubled spirit as before. 

Your "regret" is more mystifying than the step for 
which it accounts, and your good faith* only ministers, 
somehow, to the impulse that makes me challenge you ! 

GRACE. 
My ambiguity is my misfortune. 

BERNAL. 

Say rather it's mine ! If I appealed to you just now 
kindly to see me, it was to make my own behaviour 
clear. How can I make it clear — 

GRACE, interrupting. 

If I don't make mine ? — You can't ! 



i66 THE ALBUM 

Enter Sir Ralph Damant from the hall. Re-enter at the same moment 
Lady Basset from the right. 

BERNAL, to Sir Ralph, who has his latchkey visible and has stopi&gt;ed short, 
deq&gt;Iy disconcerted, on finding him with Grace. 

I asked to see Miss Jesmond. 

GRACE, to Sir Ralph. 

I arrived before Mr. Bemal 

LADY BASSET, on the right. 

/ arrived after ! 

SIR RALPH. 

And I've arrived last of all ! (Controlling with an effort, as he comes 
down, his discomfiture at Mark's meeting with Grace, and taking now the 
line of a smoothly astute and diplomatic manner of dealing with his difficulties.) 

IVe been detained, but I'm all the more pleased to find 
you gathered ! 

GRACE, grave. 

I've not presumed you'd care to find me, 

SIR RALPH, urbane, engaging, gay. 

Then I must teach you presumption ! I bid you 
welcome to Portland Place. 

LADY BASSET, impatient but majestic 

And have you no welcome for another friend ? 

SIR RALPH. 

The warmest, dear lady. I summoned you to be 
present at the sittings. 

LADY BASSET, disappointed at the inadequacy of this explanation. 

I should still have been if you hadn't ! 



ACT THIRD 167 

SIR RALPH, imperturbable ; indicating the room on the right. 
They take place there. (Then motioning her to pass out again.) 

Be so good as to await me. 

LADY BASSET. 

While you dally with Miss Jesmond ? 

SIR RALPH, answering the question but addressing Grace. 

To make up for the occasion of which Mark so cruelly 
deprived me ! 

BERNAL, gay. 

IVe made up a little, on my side, for the loss I equally 
suffered ! 

SIR RALPH. 
I take my revenge in kind ! (Opening the door on the right and 

pointing the way out to bbrnal.) Be SO good as to leave the 
room. 

BERNAL, troubled, demurring. 

This moment ? 

SIR RALPH. 

This moment ! 

BERNAL, at the door ; looking at Grace ; after an instant. 

Good-bye ! 

Exit Mark Bbrnal to the right. 

SIR RALPH, to Lady Basset, while Grace, with emotion, nervous, restless, 
wanders up to a window on the left. 

Won't you join him ? (Then as her attitude appears a refusal ; in- 
sinuating.) He admires you !

LADY a\SSET. daring ; as if stupefied. 

Do you mean by that that you don't ? 

SIR RALPH, mnriliatnry, heroic 

My admiration's of a difierent strain ! 

LADY BASSET. 

Such as it isy I'm here for you to show it 

SIR RALPH. 

I do show it 1 am showing it (Then as he indicates the open 

door and other room again.) By this privilege ! 

LADY BASSET. 

That of Mr. Bemal's company ? 

SIR RALPH, pleadingly argumentative. 

Doesn't he tell you what he thinks of you ? 

LADY BASSET. 

Every one does that ! 

SIR RALPH, still pleading. 

/ will — in three minutes ! 

LADY BASSET, at the door ; having looked at her watch. 

I shall time you ! 

Exit Lady Basset to the right. 

SIR RALPH, having closed the door and remaining an instant at the right, 
while Grace is up at the left. 

I followed you in vain, and it was sweet of you to come ! 



ACT THIRD 169 

GRACE, coming down. 

It may have been "sweet," Sir Ralph, but it has not 
been easy 1 

SIR RALPH. 

It gives me the chance to say what I wanted so much 
to say ! • 

GRACE, seating herself. 

And it gives me the chance to hear it ! 

SIR RALPH. 

What I wanted to say is that I accept your proposition. 

GRACE. 

Are you very sure, first, that you understand it ? 

SIR RALPH, surprised at her question. 

There was surely little room to blink it ! (Then after an 
instant.) And IVe taken my time to consider. 

GRACE, very quiet. 

I gather then the fruit of my exertions. 

SIR RALPH. 

If your exertions were extraordinary, you must admit 
that the fruit is splendid ! 

GRACE. 

There's nothing so splendid as the triumph of justice. 



I70 THE ALBUM 

SIR RALPH, struck, demurring. 

Do you call it by that name ? 

GRACE. 

By what name do you call it ? 

SIR RALPH. 

Generosity — extravagant ! But we won't quarrel about 
the description ! 

GRACK 

We won't quarrel about anything, in the presence of the 
accomplished fact. 

SIR RALPH, wincing, momentarily failing. 

That's a description that, I confess, does give me a 

start ! (Reflecting with intense gravity.) It brings my pOSitiOH 

home to me. 

GRACE. 

Exactly where it should be brought. 

SIR RALPH. 

I'm a bit of a fatalist ; it's the finger of doom ! My 
line of argument has been that sooner or later I should 
feel the knife at my throat — have to make the sacrifice ; 
and that it constitutes after all the purchase of my 
freedom. 

GRACE. 

When you have paid the price your freedom will be 
perfect ! 

SIR RALPH, struck, eager. 

I may do as I like — I may go my way ? 



ACT THIRD 171 

GRACE. 
My dear Sir Ralph, I'll never speak to you ! 

SIR RALPH, following up the conception of this advantage ; thinking. 

And of course, on that footing, nobody else will ! (More 
confident.) Nobody elsc can ! 

GRACE, confirmatory. 

There'll be nothing left to say ! 

SIR RALPH. 

Precisely, no locus standi, (ingenuous.) That's the one 
thing that reconciles me. 

GRACE, after an instant. 
The one thing ? (Then as he stares, struck, incipiently alarmed by her 

intonation.) No Sentiment — no emotion ? 

SIR RALPH, still staring ; plainly surprised. 

Since you press me. Madam, none whatever ! 

GRACE. 

The mere bald concession ? 

SIR RALPH, more markedly surprised, even scandalised at her qualification 
of his sacrifice. 

Do you consider it such a trifle to "concede" my 
existence ? 

GRACE, blank. 

Your existence ? 



172 THE ALBUM 

SIR RALPH. 
Even with what I reserve! My fortune, my position, 
my name ! 

GRACE. 

Your name ? What have I to do with that ? 

SIR RALPH, bewildered. 

You don't propose to bear it ? 

GRACE, rising. 
Heaven forbid, Sir Ralph ! (Then Ughtly and quietly, as he stares, 

stupefied.) You make me an offer ? 

SIR RALPH, with precii»tate and indignant eagerness. 

Never in the world ! 

GRACE. 

Then what are you talking about ? 

SIR RALPH. 
Your horrible ultimatum ! 

GRACE, after an instant. 

It's your impression that I've made you an offer ? 

SIR RALPH. 

Twice over, in so many words ! 

GRACE. 

Which you've done me the honour to accept ? 

SIR RALPH. 

For the advantage I've named ! 



ACT THIRD 173 

GRACE, amused, smiling in spite of her disgust and dismay. 

Your view of the " advantage *' touches me ! I did make 
you an offer, Sir Ralph, but it was only the offer of a 
chance. 

SIR RALPH, vague, anxious. 

A chance ? 

GRACE. 

To make a restitution — to divide your inheritance. 

SIR RALPH, staring; with his assurance flickering back. 

Divide it with you ? 

GRACE. 

With Mr. Bernal. That was my " ultimatum " ! 

SIR RALPH, dropping, overwhelmed, into the seat from which Grace 
has risen. 

That? 

GRACE. 

I appealed to you to give him his share — the share he 
would clearly have enjoyed if your kinsman had lived 
another day. 

SIR RALPH, with the same amazed ruefulness. 

Make him a present of a fortune ? 

GRACE, simple. 

Two thousand a year. 

SIR RALPH, after an instant during which he has risen. 

So that you may offer to marry Aim ? 



174 THE ALBUM 

GRACE. 
You exaggerate my impatience to marry. 

SIR RALPH. 

You exaggerate mine to indulge in preposterous gifts ! 

GRACE, after an instant. 

You don't accept your chance ? 

SIR RALPH. 

You must permit me to view it in the light of reason 1 

GRACE. 

That's exactly what I appeal to you to do. You treated 
me just now to the argument of security. Let me treat 
you to the same ! Your security is your honour. 

SIR RALPH, after an insUnt. 

And my honour, you seem to imply, is your sport ? 

GRACE. 

I daresay I could have a game with it ! 

SIR RALPH, after another instant. 

With that little ass to help you ? 

GRACE. 

Mr. Ashdown ? He's in the other room. 

SIR RALPH, with excited derision 

Quite the Chamber of Horrors ! 



ACT THIRD 175 

GRACE. 
I should apply that title to this one. 

SIR RALPH, as she moves to go. 

You leave me, Miss Jesmond ? 

GRACE, at the door to the hall. 

I've corrected your mistake. 

SIR RALPH, still with his nervous and ironic laughter. 

Won't you give me your address ? 

GRACE, blank. 

For what purpose ? 

SIR RALPH. 

I may have a word to say to you ! 

GRACE, after an instant's hesitation. 

If you have a word to say, say it to Mr. Bernal ! 

SIR RALPH, smUing. 

It may not do — for Mr. Bernal ! 

GRACE, turning to the door again. 

Then it won't do for me ! 

SIR RALPH, as she has her hand on the door ; with a sudden complete, 
quite violent change of manner and accent. 

Miss Jesmond, listen to me ! (Then as Grace, struck, arrested 

by this transformation, stops short, looking at him.) YoU Say yOU've 



176 THE ALBUM 

corrected my mistake; but I confess I've jnade more 

than one ! (Grace, as if, after a momentary hesitation, under the influence 
of a puzzled hope that his oddly altered tone may denote his readiness to do the 
justice she has demanded, comes slowly a few steps down, while he goes 'on.) 

I told you a while ago that if I stood ready to marry 
you it was without sentiment, without emotion. But 
those words were a wrong to you — they were a greater 

wrong to myself. (She continues to rest her wondering, expectant eyes 
on him, and he proceeds with gathered assurance.) The emOtlon, 

charming woman, has come — the sentiment insists on 

a voice. (Then, under the permission of her silence, producing his confident 

climax.) I make you, Miss Jesmond, the proposal that I 
regret you didn't make me ! 

GRACE, after a moment of intensely controlled disappointment and horror ; 
with the cold irony of her stupefaction. 

Your mistakes are sufficiently strange ; but I think your 
corrections are stranger ! 

SIR RALPH, insistent, persistent. 

You say that you offer me a chance ; but what is it com- 
pared to the chance I offer you ? What you ask of me 

for another, I press on you for yourself ! (Then with an ex- 
asperation rising from the vision of the incorruptibility with which she stands 

there.) Do you measurc what I mean and what I possess ? 
Can you reflect on it and refuse ? I've guessed your 
poverty ; I've sounded your depths. Without a home, 
without protection in this cruel city, consider in what a 

refuge you stand ! (Then as she simply turns from him with a move- 
ment that expresses all her sickened inaccessibility, and he has got between her 
and the door to the hall, more and more urgent and imperative, half-pleading, 
half-resentful and altogether passionate.) YoU really refuse ? 



ACT THIRD 177

Out of this house, to begin with. It's not a very nice 
place! 

MAUD, strack with her tone and air ; then kind. 

I see it has been horrid somehow (or you — ^and yet you 
have ideas for others. 

GRACE. 

I've ideas for Mr. Ashdown I He asked me to speak 
for him. 

MAUD. 

Is he here ? 

GRACE, turning away as she sees Bernal. 

Ask Mr. Bernal. 

Re-enter Mark Bernal from the right. 



ACT THIRD 179 

MAUD, joyous, spontaneous, to Bernal, who has stopped short on finding 
Grace still in the room. 

Why, Miss Jesmond's charming ! 

GRACE, facing about again quickly. 

She says so because I spoke to her of Mr. Ashdown. 

BERNAL, behind whom the door of the other room has closed ; to Maud. 

He's in there with Lady Basset. 

MAUD. 

And what's Lady Basset doing ? 

BERNAL. 

Waiting for Sir Ralph. 

MAUD, with striking ingenuousness. 

How very vulgar ! 

GRACE, to Bernal, smiling. 

Miss Vanneck's not here for that 1 

BERNAL, to Maud. 

It wouldn't help you if you were ! 

GRACE, to Bernal, urgent. 

You must appeal for your friend. 

BERNAL, to Grace. 

Your friend too, Miss Jesmond. He simply adores you. 



i8o THE ALBUM 

MAUD, struck. 

Does he indeed ? 

GRACE, amused. 

Because I intercede 1 

BERNAL. 

I've interceded too ! (To Maud.) Didn't I struggle hard 
for him ? 

MAUD. 

At Vandyke Lodge ? (After an instant.) I've not forgotten 
it! 

GRACE, to Maud. 

Let him struggle for himself ! 

BERNAL, to Maud. 

Shall I call him in ? 

MAUD, at the open door on the left ; hesitating ; then to Grace. 

What's beyond that room ? 

GRACE, smiling. 

A conservatory. 

MAUD, to Bernal. 

Please call him ! 

Exit Maud Vanneck to the left. Bernal opens door on the right, 
and on his summons re-enter Teddy Ashdown. 

GRACE, to Teddy. 

I've spoken for you ! 

TEDDY, eager. 

To dear Maud ? 



ACT THIRD i8i 

BERNAL, indicating the left. 

She's in the conservatory. 

TEDDY, at the door on the left, in suspense, his hand to his heart 

Will she have me ? 

BERNAL. 

Go and see ! 

TEDDY, aidenUy, to Grace. 

Benefactress ! 

GRACE, grave, sad. 

Ah, don't call me that/ 

TEDDY. 

Then angel ! 

BERNAL, laughing. 

Keep that for Miss Vanneck ! 

TEDDY, indicating Grace. 

Then you thank her ! 

Exit Teddy to the left. 
GRACE, smiling sadly. 

You shouldn't, for they haven't a penny ! 

BERNAL. 

What of that ? No more have we ! 

GRACE, vague. 

"We"? 

BERNAL, seeing Sir Ralph. 

It doesn't matter ! 



i82 THE ALBUM 

Re-enter Sir Ralph Damant picturesquely dressed to sit for his portrait ; a 
costume carefully selected and studied. 

SIR RALPH, stopping short, in high displeasure, on seeing Bernal 
reunited to Grace. 

You've come back ? 

BERNAL, with a gesture of abdication, of frank, final confession. 

My necessity forced me — I expected to find you. 
(After an instant.) I throw up my charge. 

SIR RALPH, aghast, kidicating the room to the right. 

That woman ? 

BERNAL. 

That avalanche ! I can't arrest its course ! 

SIR RALPH, dismayed, indignant. 

You don't appreciate her? 

BERNAL. 

I can't handle her, and I judged it right to notify you. 

SIR RALPH, thinking intently, in his alarm. 

She's not amenable — ? 

BERNAL. 

To any argument I can use ! 

SIR RALPH. 

But she has plenty of her own ! 

BERNAL. 

I perceive them, but somehow I resist them ! 



ACT THIRD 183 

SIR RALPH, contending, protesting, insbting. 

Such brilliant points ? 

BERNAL. 

She doesn't see mine ! 

SIR RALPH. 

You told me she did ! 

BERNAL. 

It was what she first told me ! But now she takes it 
all back. 

SIR RALPH, in deeper dismay the more he thinks. 

Back? 

BERNAL. 

She objects to me ! 

SIR RALPH. 

And you object to her 1 

BERNAL. 

I'm not so rude as to tell her so — but I do ! 

SIR RALPH, in the tone of indignant injury ; scandalised. 

Do you call such an objection loyal ? 

BERNAL, blank. 

" Loyal " ? 

SIR RALPH. 

After all I have done for you ! 

BERNAL. 

Pray what have you done ? 



i84 THE ALBUM 

SIR RALPH, pulkd ap^ embttrrassed an instant, by the question ; then 
indicating, with angry fatuity, the nobleness of his appearance. 

Dressed myself — as you see ! 

BERNAL, taking him in, up and down. 

For your portrait ? 

SIR RALPH, exhibiting himself. 

As the " Patron of Art " 1 

BERNAL. 

My dear Ralph, my art must go unpatronised ! (With the 

note of raeful melancholy, but smiling.) No SOng nO SUpper 1 
SIR RALPH, outraged. 

You won't paint me ? 

BERNAU 

Wasn't I to paint you only if I saved you ? 

SIR RALPH, with a wail of despair. 

So Tm lost? 

BERNAL, seeing Lady Basset. 

Ask her ladyship ! 

Re-enter Lady Basset from the right. 

LADY BASSET, pausing at the door and glaring with majestic reproach 
and displeasure at Sir Ralph. 

I've come for you ! 



ACT THIRD 185 

SIR RALPH, in mortal angubh. 

Come for me ? 

LADY BASSET. 

I gave you three minutes. 

SIR RALPH, looking at his watch, confessing in despair his transgression. • 

And I've taken thirty ! 

BERNAL, to Lady Basset, indulgently extenuating, explaining. 

You see, there's to be no portrait ! 

SIR RALPH, eagerly, in the same way. 

I'm not to sit to him. 

LADY BASSET, staring an instant ; then formidably indicating the open door. 

Then you're to sit to me ! 

SIR RALPH, demoralised, tragic, looking blankly at the open door while she 
points the way out ; and then, with the climax of despair, appealing supremely 
to Mark Bbrnal. 

Help me ! 

BERNAL, hesitating, thinking an instant ; then indicating Grace as, after 
having wandered up the stage in impatient suspense during his dialogue 
with Sir Ralph, she now comes down again. 

Help me! 



SIR RALPH, as if with the last terrified lucidity of reflection, the sudden 
dawn of a new idea, which he leaps at, making up his mind, while his eyes 
move an instant from Grace to Bernal and while Lady Basset still stands 
in control of the open door. 

Wait for me ! 

Exit Sir Ralph to the right. 



i86 THE ALBUM 

LADY BASSET, to the others, smiling triumphantly. 

He'll not be long ! 

Exit Lady Bassbt to the right. 
BERNAL, to Grace. 

I bade you good-bye ; but, thank heaven, you were kept 
for me ! 

GRACE 

I was kept by my occupations. 

BERNAL. 

The first of your occupations now (tender, ardent) must be 
to forgive me ! 

GRACE 

For believing a story so monstrous ? 

BERNAL. 

I didn't believe it, but it puzzled me ; it puzzled me 
because I cared — I mean because I loved you ! (Then, 

as she starts at this, turning away.) I hadn't the right tO tcll yOU 

so, any more than I have it now ; and that made me 
wild, it made me mad, it made things crooked and dark 
to me. 

GRACE, very sad. 

And still they're not straight, not clear ! I've tried to 
serve you, but I haven't served you yet. 

BERNAL, passionate. 

You serve me at this moment by letting me tell you 

that I trust you ! 

GRACE 

What if you trust me to little profit ? 



ACT THIRD 187 

BERNAL. 

The " profit " is the joy of confidence ! The confidence 
was there though I was troubled ; it was there though 
I was mystified. I want no proof that you're precious, 
for the only thing I ask of you is to let me deserve 
your charity ! 

GRACE. 

You make me almost want to have failed — in order to 
have the right to listen to you. You must never be able 
to say of me that my effort was half for myself. 

BERNAL. 

Give up your "effort" — give up what exposes and 
divides us ! How can I possibly desire any boon that 
has made you cruelly suffer for me ? 

GRACE, after quick, intense reflection. 

I haven't cruelly suffered " for " you ; but (with another pause 
of hesitation) I bcUeve I could suffer with you ! 

BERNAL. 

You shan't, if you'll take me ; I declare you shall only 
enjoy ! You'll teach me a better way to live ; you'll 

teach me a finer way to work ! (Taking up his hat, which he has 

put down on coming in.) Let US go forth as wc are — together ! 

GRACE, thinking, yielding, but hesitating. 

And forego the advantage — 

BERNAL, as she pauses. 

The advantage ? 



i88 THE ALBUM 

GRACE. 
Of further communion with Sir Ralph ! 

BERNAU 

Has that communion been so sweet ? (With a decisive, com- 

prehensive motion as of final and total rupture.) Good-bye tO it ! 
GRACES with a last perfunctory scruple. 

You don't really want to know — ? 

BERNAL, energetically breaking in. 

I don't want to know anything ! (Laughing.) I revel in 
my ignorance and in the prospect of your society ! 

(Then as if to vanquish her last lingering he^tation.) It WaS not for 

you to help me^ dearest — it is for me to help you ! 

GRACE, thinking, assenting, but looking about her with a faint, vague 
sigh of regret for what she gives up. 

So fate may have decreed ! (Then as she surrenders her hand, 

surrenders herself wholly.) And I like it aS well ! 

BERN AL, with a joyous laugh, drawing, pressmg her to his bosom. 

I like it much better ! 

Re-enter Tbddy Ashdown. 
TEDDY, arrested an instant ; then as they quickly separate ; radiant 

Dear Maud has accepted me ! 

BERNAL, in the same manner. 

And Miss Jesmond has accepted me ! 

Re-enter Maud Vannbck from the left. 



ACT THIRD 189 

MAUD, after a moment's modest pause in the doorway ; demurely to Grace. 

Mr. Ashdown will take me out ! 

GRACE, smiling at her and accepting Bernal's arm as if to represent the 
immediate application of the words. 

And Mr. Bernal will take me / 

BERNAL, seebg Sir Ralph. 

Though Sir Ralph looks dangerous ! 

Re-enter Sir Ralph from the right. 
SIR RALPH, white, haggard, almost ravaged. 

I've accepted Lady Basset ! 

BERNAL, smiling, as Lady Basset, radiant, reappears. 

We all do the same ! 

Re-enter Lady Basset from the right. 

SIR RALPH, looking with concentrated and agitated significance at Lady 
Basset and speaking with intense and calculated deliberation. 

You'll do so with double relish when you see with what 
zeal she joins me — 

LADY BASSET, vague, as he invitingly pauses ; as if made uneasy by his 
look and tone. 

Joins you — ? 

SIR RALPH, encouraged and sustained by her alarm. 

In an act of enlightened justice. 

GRACE, with irrepressible joy. 

Justice ? 



I90 THE ALBUM 

LADY BASSET, growing darker. 

Sir Ralph, what madness — ? 

SIR RALPH, hopefully exalted. 

The madness, my lady, of making over to Mark the 
inheritance IVe held in trust for him ! 

LADY BASSET, aghast, astounded. 

Four thousand a year ? 

SIR RALPH. 

Four thousand a year! (ToBernal.) You would have 
had it ! 

BERNAL, amazed, bewildered. 

The whole property ? I might have had a little ! 

SIR RALPH, uplifted by the assurance of his success, while he looks at 
Lady Basset. 

You shall have all ! You have nothing of your own, 
and I have enough. 

LADY BASSET, almost shrieking in her derision and dismay. 

Enough ? 

SIR RALPH. 

My dear, in having you I 

LADY BASSET, overwhelmed, indignant, with a gesture of outraged 
retractation. 

You havetCt " me " ! (With the violent motion of clearing her path, 
throwing up the whole thing, she goes rapidly up. Then at the door to the hall, 
with concentrated repudiation.) Betrayer! 

Exit Lady Basset to the hall. 



ACT THIRD 191 

BERNAL. 
My dear Ralph, you're too splendid 1 

GRACE, to Bernal. 

Wait till you get it ! 

MAUD, on Teddy's arm ; demurely, to Sir Ralph. 

You'll never see her again ! 

SIR RALPH, relieved, restored, reassured ; measuring, satisfied. 

It's cheap ! 
THE REPROBATE

Paul Doublkday. 
Captain Chanter. 
Pitt Brunt, M.P. 
Cubit. 

Mrs. Doubleday. 
Mrs. Freshville. 
Blanche Amber. 



ACT FIRST 



Whitsuntide. The drawing-room at Mr. Bonsor's villa at 
Hampton Court. Wide double doors, across the upper angle on 
the right, open from the hall and other parts of the house. Half 
way down on the right a door to the adjacent rooms. On the left, 
far up, at the other angle, a wide French window, open to the lawn. 
Further down on the left the door to the library. A table with 
drawers and several objects upon it somewhat to the left, near the 
front. More to the right a table for a tea-tray. To the right, below 
the lower door, a tall cabinet. The room old-fashioned but cheerful, 
comfortable but slightly severe. Plenty of chintz and mahogany ; 
wall-paper, hung with steel-engravings, of 1850. An old bachelor's 
house ; the whole aspect ugly. 

Enter Cubit and Mrs. Freshvillb from the hall, he backing down a litttle 
before her as if she may be forcing her way. Mrs. Freshvillb smart and 
showy, with hair conspicuously "golden." 

CUBIT. 

Certainly, ma'am, you may come in ; but Captain 
Chanter's positively not in the house. 

MRS. FRESHVILLB. 

Where then ts Captain Chanter ? 

CUBIT. 

He may have gone up to town. 



196 THE REPROBATE 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

For what purpose ? 

CUBIT. 

I haven't the least idea. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Is there any one in the house who has an idea ? 

CUBIT. 
Oh yes — lots of them ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, looking at him a moment. 

They must be rubbish. Any women ? 

CUBIT, vague and slightly shocked. 

Women, ma'am? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Petticoats. All men ? 

CUBIT, clearer. 

Two men and a boy. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, looking round her, taking everything in. 

What sort of a boy ? 

CUBIT. 

In buttons — to do the knives. 



ACT FIRST 197 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Oh that sort ! They're a fraud ! (Seeing Pitt Brunt at 

the open window, through which Brunt steps in from the lawn.) WhO S 

this person ? 

£nter Pitt Brunt. 
CUBIT, announcing. 

Mr. Pitt Brunt ! 

PITT BRUNT, coming down ; privately to Cubit, while Mrs. Fresiiville 
seats herself aft the right of the table on the left. 

Who's that person ? 

CUBIT. 

No idea, sir ! 

Exit Cubit to the hall. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 
I'm waiting — I'm awfully tired. 

PITT BRUNT, in a modified boating-suit, with a double eyeglass, very 
neat and deliberate, and slightly hesitant and puzzled. 

A — ^tired of waiting ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Not yet — in your company ! Been on the river ? 

PITT BRUNT. 
I put in an hour each day. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

/ used to put in hours — the dear old river ! 



198 THE REPROBATE 

PITT BRUNT. 
It's hygienic — if you're moderate. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

I airCt moderate ! I never was ! 

PITT BRUNT. 

It's best, you know, to be safe. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, looking at him an instant, wliile he smiles com- 
placently ; then rising suddenly. 

Do you think you are ? 

PITT BRUNT, startled a little, retreating a step, then smiling at her again. 

I'm not very sure ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, laughing. 

If you were, I'd do for you ! Are you staying in the 
house ? 

PITT BRUNT. 

No — ^are you ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 
Till I've done what I've come for. (Then abrupt, familiar. 

What have you come for ? 

PITT BRUNT. 

I put in an hour each day. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Here too ? Why, you must have a time-table ! 



ACT FIRST 199 

PITT BRUNT. 
My life is thoroughly organised. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Mine is deliciously irregular. 

PITT BRUNT. 

Ah, but you're not in the House ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, vague. 

What house ? 

PITT BRUNT. 

The House of Commons ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Do you mean you are ? 

PITT BRUNT. 

I sit for Blackport. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

At your ridiculous age ? 

PITT BRUNT, with dignity. 

My constituents have never inquired it. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

That's the sort of people I like ! Where are such ducks 
to be found ? 

PITT BRUNT. 

On the banks of the Smutt, in the extreme north. I 
meet them there, I address them, in a day or two; 



200 THE REPROBATE 

but in' the meantime I'm spending the Whitsuntide 
recess at Teddington. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

And what are you doing at Teddington ? 

PITT BRUNT. 

I'm reading. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Reading what ? 

PITT BRUNT, after an hesitation 

Everything ! 

Re-enter Cubit from' the hall. 
CUBIT. 

Mr. Bonsor has come in, sir. 

PITT BRUNT. 
And Miss Amber ? 

•CUBIT. 

Not arrived. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, to Cubit, as he waits. 
You may go. (Exit Ct- bit to the hall. To Pitt Brunt, as he takes up 
his hat to follow him.) YoU may not ! (Then as Bru.nt puts down 

his hat.) Who in the world^s Miss Amber ? 

PITT BRUNT. 

Mr. Bonsor's niece. 



ACT FIRST 201 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 
And who in the world's Mr. Bonsor ? 

PITT BRUNT, surprised at the question. 

The master of this house. One of my strongest sup- 
porters. He has interests at Blackport — I look after 
them. I have interests here — 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, interrupting. 

And he looks after them ! Tit for tat ! Is he married ? 

PITT BRUNT. 

Not yet. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

There's always time ! What's his age ? 

PITT BRU^^T, hesitating. 

He's getting on ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

And are you 1 

PITT BRUNT. 

Remarkably well ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Remarkably well married ? 

PITT BRUNT. 

Not married at all ! I mean I'm getting on. 



202 THE REPROBATE 

MRS. FRESHVILLE 

I'm glad to hear it Is she good-looking ? 

PITT BRUNT. 

Who, madam ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE 

Mr. Bonsoi^s niece. 

PITT BRUNT. 

I should use a still stronger expression. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Always use the strongest there is ! Is she one of your 
interests here ? 

PITT BRUNT, smiling. 

The greatest ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

And Mr. Bonsor looks after it ? 

PITT BRUNT. 

He desires our union. 

MR&amp; FRESHVILLE. 

" Union " is tame. Where is she to arrive from ? 

PITT BRUNT. 

From the continent, where she has spent most of her 
life, and where — in Germany, six months ago — I was 
so fortunate as to make her acquaintance. 



ACT FIRST 203 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, to herself. 

Germany ? Then it's not she / (To brunt.) Isn't there 
another woman ? 

PITT BRUNT, with simpering ardour. 

There's no other woman ! 

MR&amp; FRESHVILLE. 

For you — I see ! But for him ? 

PITT BRUNT. 

For whom ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, checking herself, reconsidering. 

Never mind whom ! (As she looks about her she suddenly spies, on 
the table on right, a roll of unfinished embroidery, on which she pounces. 

Holding it up.) Whose uutidiuess is that ? 

PUT BRUNT, looking at it with his glasses. 

That embroidery ? Perhaps it's Mrs. Doubleday's. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

And who on earth is Mrs. Doubleday ? 

PITT BRUNT. 

A lady in the house. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, with a little vindictive shake of the embroidery, 
which she clutches. 

Then I've got her ! Rich ? 



204 THE REPROBATE 

PITT BRUNT. 
Five thousand a year. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Good-looking ? 

PITT BRUNT, after an instant, 

I should use a still weaker expression. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, promptly suggestive. 

Hideous ? 

PITT BRUNT, hesitating again. 

Fat. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

And old — horribly old ? (Pressing.) How old ? 

PITT BRUNT, thinking. 

She's getting on. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE 

She ought to be ashamed of herself! Whereas her 
husband ? 

PUT BRUNT, grave. 

Beneath the sod. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, gay. 

Like mine ! What then is she doing here ? 

PITT BRUNT. 

Spending a month. 



ACT FIRST 205 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 



With a bachelor ? 

PITT BRUNT. 
They have a common object. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

What sort of object ? 



A child. 

Hers? 

His! 

Mr. Bonsor's? 



PITT BRUNT. 
MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

PITT BRUNT. 
MRS. FRESHVILLE. 



PITT BRUNT, with a somewhat scandalised movement of repudiation. 

Mr. Doubleday's — ^the son of his first marriage. This 
lady, the stepmother, is one of the joint guardians. As 
Mr. Bonsor is the other, they have often to meet. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

How old is the child ? 

PITl BRUNT. 

He's getting on, 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

You seem all to be getting on ! 



2o6 THE REPROBATE 

PITT BRUNT. 
He's about thirty. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Then why the deuce guardians ? 

PITT BRUNT. 

It's a pecuHar case — he's vicious. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Stuff— I don't believe it ! 

PITT BRUNT. 

There are such men. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

You should give them their head ! 

PITT BRUNT. 

Doubleday can't be trusted. He requires the iron hand 
— and he knows it 1 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

I see — like my young man ! 

PITT BRUNT, vague. 

Yours ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

He requires it — and he knows it. But I forgot — -you 
don't ! 



ACT FIRST 207 

PITT BRUNT. 
Permit me then to retire. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 
Send me the butler ! (Exit Pitt Brunt to the hall. Unfolding the 
embroidery, she looks at it a moment.) HideOUS ! the WOrk of an 

Ugly woman. Never mind, it's evidence ! (Roiling the 

embroidery up with dedsion, she thrusts it into her pocket.) I See my 

way. No warning a pounce ! (Seeing Cubit, she extracts her 

purse from a small smart reticule which she carries on her arm, and takes a gold 
coin from it. Re-enter Cubit from the hall. Having put the reticule upon the 
table on the left and the purse into her pocket, she hands the coin to Cubit.) 

Can you change me that ? 

CUBIT, with the sovereign, mystified. 

IVe only sixpence. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, taking the sixpence which Cubit has produced. 

Sixpence will do. 

CUBIT, still more mystified. 

And the rest ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, significant, with something very like a wink. 

Enjoy the rest ! 

CUBIT, to himself, gleefully, while he promptly pockets the sovereign. 

Nineteen-and-six ? What a rum tip ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Vm awfully thirsty. Is there any place near ? 



2o8 THE REPROBATE 

CUBIT. 
/ could give you something — for the money ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE 

The money's for something else — the money's to hold 
your tongue. 

CUBIT. 

Hold it to the Captain ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE 

Don't mention me — see ? 

CUBIT. 

I see. But who'll hold Mr. Brunt's ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

I'm already his secret : I feel I am ! Good-bye. 

CUBIT. 

I could throw in a glass of sherry. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

I loathe sherry. I'm coming back. 

CUBIT. 

Let me show you the place. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, motioning him back 

I always find the place ! Don't attract attention ! - 

Exit Mrs. FRESHVILLE to the hall. 



ACT FIRST 209 

CUBIT, alone, looking after her. 

It'll be a near thing if you don't ! Fd remark her any- 
where ! (Perceiving her reticule on the table.) HuUo ! haS she 
left me another souvenir ? (Taking up the reticule and hesitating 

while he looks at it.) Shall I go after her ? No — I'll give it 
to her when she comes back. (Sniffing at it.) My favourite 

scent what-dO-yOU-Call-*era ! (Startled, seeing Mr. BoNSOR, and 

inunediately dropping the reticule on the table.) Oh ! 

Enter Mr. Bonsor by the lower door on the right. 
MR. BONSOR, who has seen his movement. 

To whom does that article belong ? 

CUBIT. 

I was just wondering, sir. 

MR. BONSOR. 

Is your nose your organ of wonder ? I seem myself to 
become aware of the recent presence of a female. 

CUBIT. 
A lady who has just gone, sir. 

MR. BONSOR. 

Gone where ? 

CUBIT. 

No idea, sir. 

MR. BONSOR. 

What did she want ? 

CUBIT. 

She didn't seem to know ! 

VOL. II p 



2IO THE REPROBATE 

MR. BONSOR 
To whom was her visit presumably addressed ? 

CUBIT. 

Couldn't make out, sir ! cxo himseit) Nineteen-and-six ! 
WhatTlArgo? 

MR BONSOR. to himseU; strode 

To Paul ? (To Cubit.) Did she make no observation ? 

CUBIT. 

She observed that she'd come back. 

MR BONSOR. to himsel£ 

Is he at it again? cto Cubit.) When may we expect her ? 

CUBIT. 

Really can t say, sir ; but when she comes — 

MR. BONSOR 

Let me instantly know. (Looldng for a moment, with his glasses, 
without approaching it, at the reticule which Cubit has restored to its place on 
the table on the left.) Let me examine that object. (Cubit pre- 
sents him with the reticule, which, while Cubit holds it, he continues, without 
touching it, to look at in the same way.) Ruby VClvCt ? Ostcn- 

tatious. 

CUBIT. 

Slightly scented, sir. Shall I remove it ? 
MR. BONSOR. 

Not offensive. You may leave it (After cubit has again 

placed the reticule on the table.) Where is MrS. Doublcday ? 



ACT FIRST 211 

CUBIT. 
Visiting the palace, sir. 

MR. BONSOR. 

Again ? She visited the palace yesterday. 

CUBIT. 

Great historical interest, sir. Often spend an hour there 
myself. 

MR. BONSOR, in his reflections. 

Not alone, I suppose. 

CUBIT, hesitating an instant, smiling. 

Usually with a companion, sir. 

MR. BONSOR, aloof. 

I'm not interested in your companions. I allude to 
Mrs. Doubleday. 

CUBIT. 

Beg your pardon, sir. Her companion would probably 
be the Captain. 

MR. BONSOR. 

I thought Captain Chanter was to go to London. 

CUBIT, smiling. 

/ didn't, sir. He was out with her yesterday. 

MR. BONSOR, struck, prompt. 

Was he ? (Then dry.) I didn't ask you to watch their 
movements. Is Mr. Paul with them ! 



212 THE REPROBATE 

CUBIT. 

They don't take him, sir. He might watch their move- 
ments ! 

MR. BONSOR, to himself. 

It's the time to watch his! (ToCubxt.) Where is Mr. 
Paul? 

CUBIT. 

In the library, sir. 

MR. BONSOR. 
Then call him immediately. 

CUBIT, without moving. 

I might call him all day, sir — he would never be able 
to come. 

MR. BONSOR. 

What's the matter with him ? 

CUBIT. 

He's locked in. Mrs. Doubleday has the key. 

MR. BONSOR. 

Oh yes, I forgot ! (Feeling in his pocket.) I Carry duplicates. 

(Producing a key and giving it to Cubit.) Let him OUt. 
CUBIT, to himself. 

One would think he was a domestic animal ! 

Exit Cubit, with the key, to the library. 
MR. BONSOR, alone, taking up the reticule. 

A mysterious female, with a meretricious appendage? 



ACT FIRST 213 

Why not state her business? I hate anything under- 
hand. (Trying to open the bag.) Confound the Catch ! 
(Opening it.) A photOgraph ? (Taking one out of the bag.) Merci- 
ful powers — it's Paul ! What fresh connection has he 
formed, with all our safeguards? And what's this 
written on the back ? " Dudley — to his Nina ! " She's 
his Nina, of course, but why is he her Dudley? Has 
he an alias — like a burglar ? What dreadful revelations ! 
Shall I confront him with this ? No, I'll conceal it — 

I'll confer with my associate. (SUps the photograph into his breast- 
pocket ; thrusts the reticule into the cabinet on the right. Enter Paul Doublb- 
DAY, from the library, with a book in his hand. To himself, seeing him.) 

Dudley ! 

PAUL. 

Oh, Mr. Bonsor, is this a book I may read ? 

MR.^ BONSOR, with the book. 

The Experience of Life? Decidedly not — it doesn't 
sound safe ! 

PAUL. 

Shall I put it back ? 

MR. BONSOR. 
By no means. (Looking at him strangely.) Fil pUt it back ! 

Have you perused any portion of it ? 

PAUL. 

Not a word — I waited to ask you. 

MR. BONSOR. 

Then how have you been occupied ? 



214 THE REPROBATE 

PAUL, mdancholy. 

I haven't been occupied ! 

MR BONSOR, significant. 

We must occupy you ! 

PAUL. 

Do, Mr. Bonsor — I so want to fill the hours ! 



MR. BONSOR. 

You say that in a tone — 



PAUL, conciliatory, explanatory. 

The tone of conviction, Mr. Bonsor! I've tried to 
speak of it to Mamma, but Mamma is occupied. 

MR. BONSOR. 

The occupation we shall propose for you is not the same 
as that which now engrosses your mamma. 

PAUL. 

Oh, yes — I don't mean f/uif/ 

MR. BONSOR. 

It's comparatively legitimate — for Mrs. Doubleday. 

PAUL. 
Yes, and it must be so jolly ! (Then on a movement of Mr. 

Bonsor's, quick.) When it is legitimate ! 



ACT FIRST 215 

MR. BONSOR. 
When it is we may perhaps concede that ! But there 
are cases in which it isn't. I needn't remind you that 
you've forfeited — 

PAUL, with a sigh. 

Oh, I know what I've forfeited ! 

MR. BONSOR. 

I needn't remind you that our confidence in you isn't all 
that we could wish. 

PAUL, genuinely meek. 

You do remind me, Mr. Bonsor. 

MR. BONSOR. 

Occasionally, perhaps — for it's indispensable. 

PAUL. 

Yes — it's indispensable ! 

MR BONSOR. 

Such an occasion has now presented itself. If I just 
sent for you, it's to call your attention to the propriety 
of another sacrifice. 

PAUL, pleading. 

Another, Mr. Bonsor? 

MR. BONSOR. 

I count upon you to make it. 



2i6 THE REPROBATE 

PAUL, palling himself together. 

Well— 111 make it ! 

MR. BONSOR. 

You know our system — your mother's and mine. 
(Complacent.) The more sacrifices you make, the easier it 
is to make 'em ! 

PAUL. 

They come very easy now, Mr. Bonsor. 

MR. BONSOR. 

The present occasion will perhaps be something of a 
test. 

PAUL. 

There's no test, Mr. Bonsor, that I shrink from ! 

MR. BONSOR, still more complacent. 

You perceive then the success of our system ! 

PAUL, virtuous, like a prize pupil. 

It works, Mr. Bonsor — in perfection ! 

MR. BONSOR 

There's a young lady about to arrive here. 

PAUL. 

Yes, Mr. Bonsor. 

MR. BONSOR. 

My niece, Miss Amber, who has been living abroad. 
She has come to spend three months with me — I've 
very particular views for her. What I want you to 



ACT FIRST 217 

understand is that I look to you not to interfere with 
them. 

PAUL. 

Tell me what they are, Mr. Bonsor, and I will regulate 
myself accordingly. 

MR. BONSOR. 

I don't see my way to describe them to you correctly as 
anything but matrimonial. 

PAUL, with continued docility. 

You wish me to marry her ? 

MR. BONSOR, shocked. 

Not for worlds ! I wish you to do the very opposite. 

PAUL, vague. 

The very opposite ? Make up to her without intentions ? 

MR. BONSOR. 

Not make up to her at all ! She's guileless — she's 
fresh — she's pure. Let her remain so ! 

PAUL. 

You mean that I'm not to speak to her ? 

MR. BONSOR, stern. 

Never — till she speaks to you, (To himself.) Dl take care 
she doesn't ! 

PAUL, following closely. 

Then I may answer her ? 



2l8 THE REPROBATE 

MR. BONSOR. 
With extreme reserve. 

PAUL, as if learning his lesson. 

With extreme reserve. Is she possessed of — a — 
personal attractions ? 

MR. BONSOR. 

Unfortunately. 

PAUL, with intense assent. 

Unfortunately ! 

MR. BONSOR. 
Fortunately you are not ! 

PAUL, with intenser assent. 

Fortunately ! — And is her future husband ? 

MR. BONSOR. 

Her future husband is that rising young star of his 
party, Mr. Pitt Brunt. 

PAUL, precipitate. 

Oh, he's not beautiful ! 

MR. BONSOR, pointed. 

No, but he's good ! 

PAUL, checked, humiliated. 

Yes — that's everything ! 



ACT FIRST 219 

MR. BONSOR. 
IVe sent him to the station to meet Blanche. 

PAUL, alert, hi spite of himself. 

Is her name Blanche ? 

MR. BONSOR, severe. 

Youll have no occasion to pronounce it ! (Looking at his 
watch.) I'm also expecting your mother's return. 

PAUL, somewhat rueful. 

So am /, Mr. Bonsor ! 

MR. BONSOR, significant. 

She forgets herself ! 

PAUL, reassuring, yet ominous. 

Oh, she'll remember me ! 

MR. BONSOR. 
I hope so ! You constitute, in her absence, a responsi- 
bility of which I feel the weight ! (Deliberating.) I don't 
quite know what to do with you. 

PAUL, passive. 

Whatever you like, Mr. Bonsor ! 

MR. BONSOR, significant. 

There are many things to consider. 



2ao THE REPROBATE 

PAUL. 
Shall I return to the library ? 

MR. BONSOR, dubious, taking up the book given him by Paul and turning 
over a page or two. 

Not till I've weeded it out ! (Tosses down the book as if with a 
ense of contamination.) 

PAUL, suggestive. 

Mamma sometimes keeps me in her room. 

MR. BONSOR, considering. 

Tm afraid that ground is forbidden me. (Austere.) I 
never enter your mother's apartment. 

PAUL. 

Mightn't you put me in yours ? 

MR. BONSOR. 

That ground would be forbidden her^ should she have 
occasion to visit you. 

PAUL. 

She sometimes confines me in my own little room. 

MR. BONSOR. 

Your own little room's the best place for you. I'll ring 
for Cubit to convey you there. 

PAUL, angelic. 

Let me ring ! (Rings.) May I come down to tea ? 



ACT FIRST 221 

MR. BONSOR. 

I don't know that today it will be advisable. 

PAUL, venturing to plead. 

I'm uncommonly thirsty, Mr. Bonsor. 
MR. BONSOR. 

We're acquainted with some of the aberrations of your 
thirst — which it is one of the leading features of our 
system to keep under control. 

PAUL. 

Dear Mr. Bonsor, tea isn't an aberration ! (Seeing cubit.) 
Here it is ! 



Re-enter Cubit at the lower door on the right, followed by a footman 
with a tea-tray. 



CUBIT, to Mr. Bonsor. 

Tea, sir. 

MR. BONSOR. 

Put it down. (The footman deposits the tray and retires. While he is 
doing so Blanche Amber appears, unperceived by the others, at the open 

window, on the lawn.) And take Mr. Paul to his room. 

Enter Blanche Amber. 
BLANCHE, precipitate, to Cubit. 

Oh, I say — please don't! 

MR. BONSOR, startled, meeting and embracing her. 

Dearest child ! Where's Pitt Brunt ? 



222 THE REPROBATE 

BLANCHE. 
I left him behind — I came across the lawn. We walked 
from the station — my maid has my things. 

CUBIT, annottodng, as Pitt Brunt appears at the window 

Mr. Pitt Brunt ! 

Re-enter Pitt Brunt, from the lawn. 
PITT BRUNT, sUghtly dignified and injured, to Blanchb. 

I should have been glad to pursue my explanation. 

BLANCHE, laughing. 

Pursue it — but don't pursue me 1 

MR. BONSOR, to Brunt. 

You can pursue everything here. 

BLANCHE, who has been looking at Paul. 

Oh, not all at once, please ! 

MR. BONSOR, cheerful. 

There'll be plenty of time ! 

PITT BRUNT, hopeful. 

Plenty of time ! 

MR. BONSOR. 

Delighted to welcome you at last, Blanche. 

BLANCHE. 

So happy to arrive, at last, dear uncle, and to be already 
(looking round her) SO charmed With your surroundings ! 



ACT FIRST 223 

CUBIT, to Mr. BoNSOR 

Beg your pardon, sir — am I to remove Mr. Paul ? 

BLANCHE, smiling, to Mr. Bonsor. 

Won't you let me plead for him ? 

PITT BRUNT, to Paul. 

Oh, how d'ye do, Doubleday ? I didn't notice you ! 

PAUL, ingenuously delighted, privately to Pitt Brunt. 

Miss Amber does ! 

BLANCHE, privately to Mr. Bonsor. 

Forgive my rash interference — Mr. Brunt has told me 
all about him. 

MR. BONSOR. 
It was to warn you in time. (To Cubit.) Mr. Paul will 
first have his tea. 

BLANCHE, approaching the tea-tray. 

And mayn't I have mine ? 

MR. BONSOR. 
Won't you have, after your journey, something more 
invigorating — a glass of wine ? 

CUBIT. 

I've brought wine, sir. (Mr. Bonsor signifies to Cubit that nothing 
more is wanted, on which Cubit goes out by lower door on the right.) 

BLANCHE, to Paul, seeing him approach the tea-table. 

Will you give me a glass of wine ? 



224 THE REPROBATE 

Paul, at this darts in silence to the decanter and, filling a glass, hands it to 
Blanche. While he is in the act of doing so enter Mrs. Doubleday from 
the hall, perceiving with visible horror what b taking place. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, with loud abruptness. 

Paul ! 

PAUL, with a startled jump, letting his wine-glass fall. 

Mamma ? 



MRS. DOUBLEDAY, to herself, coming down. 

Drinking — with a woman ! 

MR. BONSOR, to Mrs. Doubledav. 

My niece has arrived from Germany. (To Blanche.) My 
amiable friend Mrs. Doubleday. (Mrs. doubleday, without 

shaking hands, greets Blanche with a distant and majestic curtsey.) 

BLANCHE, after returning her salutation very much in the same way, to 
Pitt Brunt, who, having seized from the agitated Paul the decanter and 
another glass, approaches her obsequiously. 

Amiable ? I don't believe it ! 

PITT BRUNT, pouring out wine. 

An exemplary woman. 

BLANCHE. 

I detest exemplary women ! 

PITT BRUNT, reprehensive. 

Oh, Miss Amber ! 

BLANCHE. 

And also exemplary men ! 



ACT FIRST 225 

PITT BRUNT. 
You are paradoxical ! Let me give you a glass of wine ! 

BLANCHE. 

Thank you — iVe changed my mind. (Seeing that PAu^ after 

his accident with the wine-glass, has poured out a cup of tea.) But 1 11 

have a cup of tea. 

Paul, taking the invitation, darts to her with the cup. Enter at the same 
instant from the hall Captain Chanter. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Paul! 

PAUL, startled, jumping as before, and all but letting the cup drop. 

Mamma ? 

CHANTER, rushing forward and catching the cup. 

Saved ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, seated down on the left. 
Then bring it to me I (Chanter brings her the tea.) 

MR. BONSOR, mtroducing. 

Captain Chanter — Miss Amber ! 

BLANCHE, after nodding gaily at Chanter, who has bowed to her. 

I seem dangerous to the glass and china ! 

CHANTER, gallant, with his hand on his heart. 

Not only, I take it, to such fragile objects ! 

VOL. II Q 



226 THE REPROBATE 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Captain ! 

CuANTBK Teeis round and talks to her. Pitt Bkunt meantiine has gqoe back 
to the tea&gt;table and exchanged his decanter and glass for a cup of tea, with 
which he returns to Blanche. Mr. Bonsor, going up, has poured out a 
cup of tea and administered it, as it were, to Paul, who stands helpless 
and ruefuL 

PITT BRUNT, with the cup, to Blanche. 

Let pt€ serve you. 

BLANCHE. 

Don't think me very capricious if I change my mind 
again. (To Mr. Bonsor.) I think what I really and truly 
want is to go to my room. 

MR. BONSOR. 

Let me instantly conduct you. 

PITT BRUNT, to Blanche. 

Let m€ wait for you here. 

MR. BONSOR, to Pitt Brunt. 

You're to stay to dinner, you know. 

PITT BRUNT. 

I've brought my things. 

MR. BONSOR. 

Cubit will show you where to dress. 

PITT BRUNT, at the door to the hall to Blanche, whose back is turned. 

Auf Wiedersehen ! 

Exit Pitt Brunt. 



ACT FIRST 227 

MR. BONSOR, to Mrs. Doubleday. 

Shall I find you hexe in ten minutes ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. appealing to Captain Chantbs. 

In ten minutes ? 

CHANTER, looking at his watch and smiling ; to Mr. Bonsor. 

Say a quarter of an hour ! 

MR. BONSOR. 

A quarter of an hour. (He opens the lower door on the right for 
Blanche, who, during the appeal to Mrs. Doubleday, has passed round and 
paused an instant before Paul, whom she looks at sympathetically and a trifle 
strangely ; a movement, a passage between them, observed by Mrs. Doubleday.) 

BLANCHE, at the door, to Mrs. Doubleday, smiling. 

Excuse me ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 
Don't mention it ! (Exeunt Blanche and Mr. Bonsor.) Paul ! 

PAUL, who has his eyes fixed musingly on the door ; startled. 

Yes, Mamma ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Go to your room. 

PAUL. 

Mayn't I come down to dinner ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, after consideration. 

On the understanding that you sit by me, 

CHANTER, protesting tenderly. 

Then, dear lady, whom shall / sit by ? 



228 THE REPROBATE 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, privately, warning. 

Hush — before him ! (To Paul.) Go ! 

PAUL. 

Yes, mamma. 

Exit Paul, submissive, to the hall. 
MRS. DOUBLEDAY, looking on the table. 

Where in the world's my embroidery ? 

CHANTER, helping her to look. 

Your embroidery ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

It was here — it's gone. 

CHANTER, gallant. 

If I had seen it I should doubtless have purloined it — 
treasure-trove ! But I really haven't seen it 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. glancing about. 

I should prefer you to see it. 

CHANTER, pleading. 

Not just now, you know — I want aU your attention. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

You've had it these three hours. 

CHANTER. 

Three hours were not enough — for all I had to say ! 



ACT FIRST 229 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Yet you spoke with eloquence. 

CHANTER. 

Say indeed with passion — with all the ardour of a 
sentiment long repressed, bursting forth in a flood ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

And I followed you with natural embarrassment. 

CHANTER. 

With nothing more natural than embarrassment ? With 
no indulgence for my faults, with no encouragement for 
my hopes ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

I must consider — I must consult. 

CHANTER. 

Consult with me I It's just for that I offer myself! 
Didn't you tell me, moreover, that you would answer 
me in this place ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

IVe immense responsibilities. 

CHANTER. 

It's for the way you discharge them that I revere you. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

They've quite worn me out. What's left is — what you 
see. 



230 THE REPROBATE 

CHANTER. 
What I see is the most charming creature in England — 
a woman the picture of whose rich maturity is but the 
voluminous record of her extraordinary virtue. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

I believe I've done my duty — but the burden has been 
heavy indeed. 

CHANTER. 

Let me take it on my shoulders ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Wait till you know what it has been in the past, to 
judge what it may be in the future. 

CHANTER, smiling. 

In the future we shall be two. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Say, alas, we shall be three ! 

CHANTER. 

Oh, if you count that way we shall be four. We 
mustn't forget dear Bonsor. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Never — he has been everything to me. 

CHANTER, dubious. 

Everything ? 



ACT FIRST 231 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

In my interminable martyrdom. 

CHANTER. 

Hell always be at his post. There's no fear of his ever " 
marrying ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

There never was. He's impervious to female charms. 

CHANTER, smiling. 

That makes one more comfortable. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Oh, I haven't thought of conquest — I've thought only 
of my daily round. Mr. Bonsor will* accuse me of 
deserting him. 

CHANTER, argumentative, cogent. 

You reinforce him ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

I certainly shouldn't look at you unless I thought you 
were good. 

CHANTER, self-complacent. 

I do try to be good. The best of us can only try. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

And not all who try succeed. You do. 

CHANTER, simpering. 

Very kind of you to have noticed it. 



232 THE REPROBATE ; 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

That's why I shrink from telling you everything. 

CHANTER. 

To the pure all things are pure ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

So I've had often to say to myself — in the atmosphere 
of Paul's propensities. 

CHANTER. 

It has left you unspotted. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. anxious. 

Will it leave you so ? That's the question that haunts 
me now. 

CHANTER. 

Just try me and see ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

You know, then, in a general way, the task I accepted 
on the lamented death of Mr. Doubleday. 

CHANTER. 

To watch over the product of his earlier union. You 
may be said to have watched. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 
Night and day — it was a sacred trust. His earlier union 
had been a blunder. 



ACT FIRST 233 

CHANTER. 



He didn't know you. 



MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

He couldn't. I was scarcely born. 

CHANTER. 

If you had been you'd have been saved — 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

This crashing legacy? It's not improbable. But I 
came too late. 

CHANTER. 

Not too late to save Paul. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Have I saved him ? That remains to be seen ! His 
mother, alas, was — indelicate ! 

CHANTER. 

There are such women ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

She was a person of some appearance; but she was bold. 

CHANTER. 

Yet not unattractive 1 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

There were persons who thought so ; but don't ask for 
details. 



234 THE REPROBATE 

CHANTER. 
I know you well enough to know it would be useless. 
But even without them I can judge of the blood that 
flows in PauFs veins. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Heredity, heredity ! My husband's favourite expression. 
He saw it bear dreadful fruit. 

CHANTER. 

From the child's earliest years ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Almost in the cradle. * Fortunately he was on the look- 
out. 

CHANTER, impulsive. 

Poor old chap ! (Then prompt.) I mean Paul ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

It's indeed his misfortune even more than his fault. 
But it was to the advantage of every one when the fatal 
fountain of such dangers at last ceased to flow. My 
predecessor succumbed — to the last penalties of im- 
propriety; and Mr. Doubleday, after a considerable 
interval, did what he could to repair his original error. 

CHANTER. 

He married a faultless being. 



ACT FIRST 235 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

That's what he was so good as to pronounce me. Un- 
happily his compensation was not so complete as I could 
have wished. I presented him with a second son, who, 
alas, didn't live. . 

CHANTER. 

If he had, he too would have been faultless. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Heredity again ! It was then that we looked in the 
face — that we sadly but heroically accepted — our re- 
sponsibilities to our little incumbrance: not with the 
vain hope of making him what his brother would have 
been, but with that of repressing his inchnations. 

CHANTER. 

And in some degree you succeeded ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Till his twentieth year. Then they burst forth. 

CHANTER, pressing. 

What did he do ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, hesitating, scrupulous. 

Can I safely tell you ? 

CHANTER. 

To the pure all things are pure ! 



236 THE REPROBATE 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Suppose I should communicate a taint ? 

CHANTER. 

I must get accustomed to my danger. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

One does. Paul disappeared. 

CHANTER. 

How did he manage it ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

By the assistance of another person. 

CHANTER 

What description of person ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

The lowest description. A singer, from the "Waterloo." 

CHANTER. 

The Waterloo? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

The name of a popular music-hall. You don't know 
such things — but IVe had to learn them ! Ifer name 
was Nina. 

CHANTER, startled. 

Nina ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Did you ever see her ? 



ACT FIRST 237 

CHANTER. 
Dear me, no ! (To himself.) Nina ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

They went to Paris. 

CHANTER, impulsive, inadvertent. 

That's the best place ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, surprised. 

What do you know about it ? 

CHANTER, on his guard. 

One can't help hearing. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

/ can't, but you should ! We pursued him, we had a 
hunt! and, after unspeakable anxieties and incredible 
efforts, we finally ran him to earth. 

CHANTER with increasing interest. 

Where was he ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

In sumptuous apartments — steeped to the lips in vice. 
He had given the rein to his passions. 

CHANTER, breathless. 

All of them ? 



238 THE REPROBATE 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Without exception. He had changed his name, he had 
waxed his moustache, he had overdrawn his account. 

CHANTER. 

Then you arrived just in time. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

To take him home. We took him. 

CHANTER. 

Did he kick? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

He was prostrate, he couldn't deny it. 

CHANTER. 

No, poor fellow, he does own up ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Our only mercy. He sees himself as he is. Well he 
may, when he killed his father. 

CHANTER, startled. 

Do you really mean — ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

I mean that my husband died of the scandal. But in 
his last hours he cut me out my work. 

CHANTER. 

To keep hold of Paul ? 



ACT FIRST 239 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

To prevent a recurrence. 

CHANTER. 

And youVe prevented it ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

With the help of Mr. Bonsor, whom, as my husband's 
oldest and dearest friend, he appointed, as it were, my 
joint-supervisor. A childless widow with an ample pro- 
vision, I had command of my time, and an equally child- 
less bachelor with an equally adequate fortune, Mr. 
Bonsor had command of his. WeVe given it all to our 
work, we've had no other life. 

CHANTER. 

It's time to have another now. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Sometimes — when I falter — I think so. 

CHANTER. 

You've done so much. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

We've reduced it to a science. To act on the slightest 
symptom. 

CHANTER. 

To cry " Fire ! " on the first puff of smoke ! 



240 THE REPROBATE 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

If we SO much as sniff it, we turn on the hose. We 
flood the whole place. 

CHANTER. 

So that Paul lives, as it were, under water. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

It has taught him to swim, it has made him amphibious. 
We organise his hours; we regulate his thoughts; we 
control his imagination. We're intensely particular, for 
instance, about his reading. Nothing that treats of the 
passions. 

CHANTER. 

That cuts it down ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

We cut it down. We cut everything down. We allow 
him no pocket-money. 

CHANTER: 

None at all ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Sixpence a day. 

CHANTER. 

You can't be very bad on that ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

You can be very good ! He gives it to the poor. We 
allow him no tobacco, no wine, and no female ac- 
quaintance. 



ACT FIRST 241 

CHANTER. 
What then do you allow him ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Nothing. To such a nature everything's an opportunity. 
He reports himself at fixed hours, and, as you know, I 
rarely leave his side. 

CHANTER. 

Yes, I had a job to get you off. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

I locked him up. 

CHANTER. 

But he got out. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Mr. Bonsor must have taken the responsibility. Four 
times a year we spend a month here — for Mr. Bonsor to 
do his part 

CHANTER. 

He seems to do it very well. 

MRS. POUBLEDAY, dubious. 

Mr. Bonsor requires to be kept up. He shouldn't have 
invited that girl. 

CHANTER. 

Oh, 111 look after i^dr/ 

VOL. II R 



242 THE REPROBATE 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Don^t take the trouble, Fll look after her ! Now you 
see my life. 

CHANTER. 

To see it is to admire it ; but there's one thing I don't 
understand 1 Paul's healthy, hearty, independent — 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

He's still an infant. 

CHANTER. 
An infant of thirty ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

By the terms of his father's will. He doesn't come of 
age till he's forty ; unless before that, in the exercise of 
our discretion, if it seems to us finally safe, we anticipate 
a little, we put him in possession. 

CHANTER. 

He could break such a will in an hour ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

It would never occur to him — he takes our view. 

CHANTER. 
Very obliging of him ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

I do him justice — he repents. He's afraid of his 
passions. 



ACT FIRST 243 

CHANTER, as if with the deliberate resolve to face, courageously, consider- 
able exposure. 

Well, I ain't ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, anxious, ominous. 

Are you sure they're riot contagious ? 

CHANTER. 

I'll set him the example of mine. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 
Yours ? 

CHANTER. 

I've only one — it's for you ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

You're almost irresistible — but think it well over! 
(Seeing Mr. bonsor.) Here's Mr. Bonsor, for one of our 
regular councils, which we never postpone. (Re-enter Mr. 

Bonsor from the lower door on the right. Waving Captain Chanter toward 

the Ubrary.) Think it over and over ! 

CHANTER, at the door of the library. 

Coquette ! 

Exit Captain Chanter. 
MR. BONSOR. 

On what are you inviting him so peculiarly to brood ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

My peculiar position. 



244 THE REPROBATE 

MR. BONSOR. 
What has he got to do with it ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. modest. 

That he must confide to you himself. 

MR. BONSOR. 

Mrs. Doubleday, you've a bad conscience ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, with spirit. 

Not worse than you ought to have ! 

MR. BONSOR. 

I'm not straying into languid by-paths — I'm not thinking 
of a sacrifice to Hymen. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Of marriage ? You think of nothing else but that girl's ! 

MR. BONSOR. 

Well, if Tm a victim of duty, I'm also Blanche's uncle. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

And if rm a victim of duty, I'm also — (Checking herself 

as if from delicacy.) 

MR. BONSOR. 

Not the Captain's aunt — though you might be ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

There's something you might be, Mr. Bonsor: a little 
more correct in your figures ! 



ACT FIRST 245 

mr: BONSOR. 
This is not a time to recriminate — it's a time for har- 
monious action. (Taking the photograph fiom hb pocket) Look 

at that ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, with the photograph. 

Paul! 

MR. BONSOR. 

Dudley ! 

. MRS. DOUBLEDAY, looking at the back. 

Nina ! 

MR. BONSOR. 

She's here ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, horrified. 

Here? 

MR. BONSOR. 

Come back for him ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

After all these years ? 

MR. BONSOR. 

They've been wasted ! She was here an hour ago — she 
may return at any moment. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Prevent her — head her off! 

MR. BONSOR. 

Shall I see her alone ? 



246 THE REPROBATE 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. dabious. 

No, that won't do ! FU see her ! 

MR. BONSOR. 

Such a person ? It's indecorous. Fll see her ! 

Exit Bfr. BoMSOS rapidly to the hall. 
MRS. DOUBLEDAY, with the photograph in her hand. 

He's too proper by half; he needn't accuse me! 

CTceati the photograph on the table and goes qoiddy to the door of the library, 
where she calls.) Captain ! (Then as Chantkr reappears: re-enter 

Captain Chantsr.) She's come back ! 

CHANTER. 

Who's come back ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Nina! 

CHANTER, bounding in. 

Nina? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

We must double the guard ! 

CHANTER, to himself, excited, alarmed. 

Heavens ! if it's my Nina ? (To Mrs. doubleday.) Where 
is she ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Mr. Bonsor's gone to look. 

CHANTER, nervous, starting to go up. 

17/ go to look ! 



ACT FIRST 247 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, commanding. 
Captain ! (As Chanter comes down again.) You'll Stay here. 
(Indicating the table.) Thcrc's his photOgraph. 

CHANTER, taking the photograph. 
And where's hers ? (Tosses the photograph back.) 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, struck. 

Why should you want it ? 

CHANTER, rueful. 

True — when we have the reality ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

I'll turn the key in Paul's door ! 

CHANTER, looking at his watch. 

You must dress for dinner. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 
His room is next to mine. (Then with sudden seductiveness.) 

Now do you want me ? 

CHANTER, ardent. 

More than ever, beloved ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, giving himlier hand to kiss. 

Then take me ! 

Chanter seizes it and kisses it with an air of rapture, on which Mrs. Double- 
day, snatches it away and goes out hastily to the hall. Re-enter Cubit by 
the lower door on the right. 



248 THE REPROBATE 

CUBIT. 

I've put out the embroidered waistcoat, sir. 

CHANTER, to himseU; agitated. 

Embroidered by Nina's hand ! 

Exit Captain Chantxs by the lower door od the right. 
CUBIT, alone. 

Does he know she was here ? has he seen what she left ? 
Where is that elegant object ? (Seeing blanchx ambbk at the 

window.) Her^S an elegant object ! (Renter Blanche, dressed 

for dinner, from the lawn.) Quite comfortaUe in your room, 
Miss? 

BLANCHE. 

Perfectly, thank you ! 

CUBIT, looking at his watch. 

Dinner in ten minutes. 

BLANCHE. 

I'm quite ready. (Exit Cubit to the haiL) What sociable 
servants ! (At the table on the left.) But what dreary books ! 

(Taking up one.) The Experience of Life} (Turning it over.) 

Improving ! (Flinging it down.) I hate improvement ! The 

usual photographs ? (Takmg up the photograph of Paul.) Ah, 

no, not quite ! Poor Mr. Paul — in all his impropriety ! 

What a history ! He is handsome ! (Turning over the photo- 
graph.) But why "Dudley"? Some wild pet name! 
How romantic ! And who's " Nina " ? (Musing while she 
looks again at Paul's image.) Some great lady, perhaps, whose 
head he has turned — her pet name ! Is she handsome ? 



ACT FIRST 249 

(With h«r eyes for a moment on the picture.) I hopC DOt ! (Seeing 
Paul, who has appeared at the window, she is so startled that, as he comes in 
and down, she slips the photograph, to prevent his seeing it, precipitately, in- 
stinctively into her pocket. Enter Paul Doublbdav from the lawn ; shyly, 
hesitatingly, tentatively, as if his pretext has suddenly failed him. He is not 
dressed for dinner. He comes doMm, however, with a visible mixture of impetu- 
osity and caution, which gives him an odd air that makes Blanchb appear to 
wonder, with sudden amusement, what is the matter with him.) Ar6 yOU 

looking for anything ? 

PAUL, panting a little. 

No, thank you ! — I mean 1 am/ 

BLANCHE. 

Anything that was on that table ? 

, PAUL, looking vaguely and as if a little surprised. 
Nothing that was on that table. (Seeing Tke Experience of Life.) 

Not that book — I mayn't touch it 

BLANCHE. 

The Experience of Life ? Don't — it's dreadfully slow ! 

PAUL, surprised. 

It's too fast for me ! Have you any books ? 

BLANCHE, thinking. 

Any books ? 

PAUL. 

Any safe ones. They're all impossible here. 

BLANCHE. 

Impossibly dull ? 



2SO THE REPROBATE 

PAUL. 
Impossibly lively ! They excite a train of thought. 

BLANCHE. 

In this good house — ^my uncle's ? 

PAUL. 

I mean for me. But I'm not like others — I'm so easily 
upset ! 

BLANCHE, looking at him an instant with compassitMiate assent and interest. 

Ah, yes — I know ! 

PAUL, struck- 

You know already ? 

BLANCHE. 

My uncle has mentioned it. 

PAUL, with a sigh of resignation. 

Yes, he always mentions it ! 

BLANCHE. 

And Mr. Pitt Brunt had hinted — 

PAUL, with a flash of spirit. 

Mr. Pitt Brunt ? I'd thank him not to hint ! 

BLANCHE. 

He spoke of it kindly — he's sorry for you. IVe* a 
charming book upstairs — a railway novel. 



ACT FIRST 251 

PAUL, with a sigh of renunciation. 

Ah, railway novels won't do ! Quite forbidden ! 

BLANCHE, with the same compassion. 

They do keep you short ! 

PAUL, making every concession. 

They have to, you see. (After an instant.) My propensities, 
you know. 

BLANCHE, grave, impressed. 

Are they so awfully marked ? 

PAUL. 

With big black numbers— one, two, three ! 

BLANCHE, wondering 

Three ? 

PAUL. 

Oh, there are more than that! But don^t ask me to 
count. 

BLANCHE. 
Not for the world. (Then after an instant, smiling.) Fll COUUt ! 

PAUL. 

As you see them appear ? You'll get tired ! 

BLANCHE. 

They don't appear — it seems to me — in your appear- 
ance ! 



252 THE REPROBATE 

PAUL. 
Ah, the very worst of them is my duplicity ! But if you 
know I'm not naturally good, you must also know that I 
at least struggle to be. 

BLANCHE. 

Why, I do that myself! 

PAUL. 

Yes, but you don't fall. I invariably do. I did just 
now, at my window. 

BLANCHE, Uughiog. 

You don't mean you fell out of it ! 

PAUL. 

That would have hurt me less. No. I looked at you — 
I looked at you in the garden. 

BLANCHE. 
Oh yes, I went down there — I had finished dressing. 

PAUL. 

/hadn't — but I unblushingly gazed at you. 

BLANCHE 

I didn't see you — I was admiring the garden. It's very 
lovely. 

PAUL, explosive. 

Never so lovely as with you in it ! 



Oh, Mr. Doubleday 



ACT FIRST 253 

BLANCHE. 

! 



PAUL. 

See how bad I am ! After I had stared a few moments 
I came straight down — I followed you in here. 

BLANCHE. 

But how does that " hurt " you ? 

PAUL. 

It excites a train of thought. 

BLANCHE, laughing. 

Like the railway novels ? Thank you ! 

PAUL. 

Mr. Bonsor gave me a tremendous caution. 

BLANCHE. 

So he did me ! 

PAUL. 

And I gave him a tremendous pledge. 

BLANCHE. 

Well, I didn^t ! 

PAUL. 

Oh, you're free — because you're good ! 

BLANCHE. 

It's better to have passions and control them. 



254 THE REPROBATE 

PAUL. 
That's just what I didn't do — ^when I came down here ! 

BLANCHE, after an instant. 

Was it a passion that brought you ? 

PAUL. 

I don't know what to call it. Miss Amber. It was an 
emotion not to be controlled ! See, I'm getting worse ! 



BLANCHE. I 

You must pull up — you must recover yourself ! 

PAUL. 

I shall try to do so presently ; but, before I begin, let 
me say this one thing, which was really, I think, the 
idea that made me break my vow ! I want you to 
understand my reserve. 

BLANCHE, smiling. 

I don't see your reserve, Mr. Doubleday ! 

PAUL, quickly, reassuring. 

You will in a moment ! Then please remember this, 
that if I don't speak to you it's because I'm forbidden, 
and if I don't look at you, it's because I'm afraid. 

BLANCHE. 

What are you afraid of? 

PAUL. 

I'm afraid of myself 1 



ACT FIRST 255 

BLANCHE, impressed, taking it very seriously. 

You live, then, in such terror? 

PAUL. 

Not quite in terror, perhaps, but in very grave anxiety. 
I never know what I may do next ! 

BLANCHE, smiling. 

You frighten me a little ! 

PAUL. 

Oh, now that IVe explained, I shall again put on the 
mask ! 

BLANCHE, sighing. 

The tragic mask ! 

PAUL. 

Not even that : the expressionless ! 

BLANCHE. 

Well, if you mayn't express, / may ! 

PAUL, a little ironic. 

Mustn't you first ask Pitt Brunt ? 

BLANCHE. 

Never ! He has no passions. 

PAUL. 

Yes, he has an easy life of it. 



256 THE REPROBATE 

BLANCHE. 

He talked to me just now about the Bill of 'S6, I 
attach no importance to the Bill of '86 ! 

PAUL, vacue. 

You think it didn't go far enough ? 

BLANCHE. 

Mr. Brunt says it went too far ! 

PAUL. 

He always thinks everything Moes. That is doubtless 
the danger ! 

BLANCHE, sympathetic. 

It's the danger that makes the hero ! 

PAUL. 

Oh, rm not a hero ! I'm too often beaten ! 

BLANCHE, with pity and curiosity. 

The enemy's so strong ? 

PAUL 

Overwhelming, Miss Amber ! 

BLANCHE. 
It makes your problem wonderfully interesting — your 
situation intensely dramatic. I should like immensely 
to help you ! 

PAUL. 

How can you ? 



ACT FIRST 257 

BLANCHE. 
By fighting at your side. 

PAUL. 

In the thick of the fray ? You'd be scandalised ! 

BLANCHE. 

Ah, not so easily ! I can understand temptation — I 
can allow for it 1 

PAUL. 

What do you know about it ? 

BLANCHE, after an instant, quite exalted. 

IVe felt it ! 

PAUL. 

But always resisted ! 

BLANCHE, after another hesitation, in the same way. 

Not always ! 

PAUL, with vehemence. 

Ah, don't undermine me ! 

BLANCHE. 

Not for the world — ^but I must look the enemy in the 

face ! (Seeing Pitt Brunt.) SilcnCC ! 

Re-enter Pitt Brunt from the hall and stands looking an instant from 
Blanche to Paul. 

PITT BRUNT, to Paul. 

You're not dressed for dinner ? (As if with the habit of setting a 

superior example.^ I am ! 

VOL. 11 S 



25« THE REPROBATE 

PAUL. 
Oh, yoiire good ! But HI dress now. 

Exit Paui. to the haU. 
BLANCHE, with slight irony, to Pitt Bsumt. 

Yes — ^you're faultless ! 

PITT BRUNT, much gratified. 

Delighted to hear it from you^ Miss Amber ! 

BLANCHE. 

You wouldn't be if you knew (Pauses, as she turns away, with 

a vague shrug.) 

PITT BRUNT. 

If I knew what ? 

BLANCHE. 

That I can enter into — every aberration ! 

PITT BRUNT, shocked. 

Every one ? 

BLANCHE, reconsidering. 

Well, most ! (Pointing at the door on the left.) What's in there ? 

PITT BRUNT. 

The library. 

BLANCHE. 

I'll look at the books. 

PITT BRUNT. 

They're perfectly unobjectionable. 



ACT FIRST 259 

BLANCHE. 
So much the worse ! 

Exit Blanche to the library. 
PITT BRUNT. 

Awfully paradoxical, but awfully charming ! 

Re-enter, from the hall, Mrs. Frbshville accompanied by Cubit. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. to Cubit. 

Don't announce me go away ! (Cubit bows obsequiously and 

exit to the hall. To Brunt, familiarly.) Dinner-time, eh? 

PITT BRUNT, surprised. 

Do you dine with us ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

No, but I suppose fu does, doesn't he ? 

PITT BRUNT, freshly mystified. 

Again, madam, I'm in doubt — 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

No matter — / ain't ! 

PITT BRUNT. 

You're very mysterious, but it's attractive ! Whoever the 
gentleman is, he's dressing. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, looking about her for her reticule. 

ril dress him ! Where's my bag ? 



26o THE REPROBATE 

PITT BRUNT. 
Your bag ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

I forgot it here — it contains treasures. Please produce it. 

PITT BRUNT. 

Dear madam, how shall I produce it ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

By finding it. I must have it. Look for it. 

PITT BRUNT, glancing about. 

I am looking ; I don't see it ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Look more. Go and ask the butler. 

PITT BRUNT. 

I usually ring — for a servant. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

/ don't — I pounce. Try pouncing. 

PITT BRUNT, amused. 

I often try it in the House ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Then " go for him *' — there's a dear ! 

PITT BRUNT. 
Oh, if you put it fAaf way — ! 



ACT FIRST 261 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, smiling. 

I'll put it any way you like ! 

PITT BRUNT. 

You're more and more mysterious ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Not when you know me ! 

PITT BRUNT, after an instant. 

I should be glad to make time to know you. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, gay. 

Naughty man ! what would the young lady say ? (Then as 
he protests.) First see about my bag. 

PITT BRUNT, graUfied. 

I'll see about it. 

Exit Pitt Brunt to the hall. 
MRS. FRESHVILLE, alone. 

The member for Blackport ? There's more in him than 
meets the eye ! (Then in another tone.) They assemble here 
for dinner ? Then for my gentleman ! (As she sees Chanter.) 
As large as life — in my old waistcoat ! 



Re-enter Captain Chanter by the lower door on the right ; stopping short, 
transfixed, appalled. 



CHANTER. 
Nina ? Horrors ! (Then with a quaver of dismay as she simply stands 
before him unmistakable and imperturbable.) What doeS this mean ? 



262 THE REPROBATE 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Can't you imagine? 

CHANTER. 

Nothing so awful ! Go away ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Not without youy my duck. I've come for you ! 

CHANTER, more and more alarmed. 

You're mad — ^you're wicked — ^you're indecent ! They'll 
all be here ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Then you can present me ! That's what I've waited for. 

CHANTER. 

You've waited ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

All the afternoon. 

CHANTER. 

And who has seen you ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Only one or two, as yet; but the rest shall have the 
treat. 

CHANTER, scared, helpless, going up to look out and commg down. 

Nina, do you want to crush me ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Yes, to small pieces. And to pick them up and keep 
them. 



ACT FIRST 263 

CHANTER. 

Keep them in a mortuary urn — youVe killing me ! How 
did you get here ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

The same way as you, I suppose. By the aid of my wits. 

CHANTER. 

Your wits are remarkable, but theyVe sadly misled you. 
You've taken a fatal step ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 
Fatal, no doubt (whipping out the roU of tapestry she has appropriated in 

the first scene) to the perpetrator of this ! 

CHANTER. 

Vou took it ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

To convict you. The last link in the chain ! 
CHANTER. 

Give it back to me ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

To give back to /ter? Let her give you back first 

(Then tossing the tapestry away.) FaUgh ! 

CHANTER, distracted. 

They're coming ! Let me meet you somewhere else ! 



264 THE REPROBATE 



MRS. FRESHVILLE, ; 

At the altar, Captain Chanter — to-morrow ! 

CHANTER- 

Make an appointment with me — we'll talk it over ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

We'll talk it over now — it'll save time. 

CHANTER. 

I can't — I'm faint ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

I've no doubt you are ! 

CHANTER. 

For want of food ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Doesn't she give you enough — with the fortune you're 
hunting so hard ? Come with me and you shall have 
plenty ! 

CHANTER. 

There's no such person as you suppose ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Then why are you so afraid she'll see me ? 

CHANTER. 

There are ladies here, but they're innocent — ! 



ACT FIRST 265 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

I don't suspect them all — one will do ! 

CHANTER. 

Who poisoned your mind ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

You, and your flagrant bad faith; your unnatural ab- 
sences and your still more unnatural explanations. So 
I sent for the doctor. 

CHANTER. 

You do run up bills ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

I sent for two or three. They had a consultation and 
found out what was the matter. 

CHANTER. 

I could have told you for nothing ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

They put their finger on the place ! 

CHANTER, blank. 

What place ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

This place ! They followed you ; they tracked you. 

CHANTER. 

Detectives ? (Reproachful, bantering.) Oh, bad Nina ! • 



266 THE REPROBATE 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

They showed me the way ! I took it. 

CHANTER, with his hand ftimbling in his pocket, going up again and coming 
down, irresolute, desperate, on pins and needles. 

Then what'll you take now ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Nothing, thanks : I had something at the inn ! 

CHANTER. 

What can I do for you ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Redeem your solemn vow — make me your wedded wife ! 

CHANl ER, stands for an instant thinking, covering his face with his hands. 

Meet me then — ^to-morrow. Ill come up to town. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 
With the ring in your hand ? 

CHANTER. 

And bells on my toes — all the jewelry you want ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

My wants are limited to a plain gold circle. And you 
needn't come up to town — I shall be here. 

CHANTER. 

If you don't allow me my freedom of action, how can I 
square her? 



ACT FIRST 267 

MRS. FRESH VI LLE. 

Allow me mine. Fll square her ! 

CHANTER. 

Don't you see that if you make a scene — ? (Checks himself, 

listening.) 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Well, if I make a scene ? 

CHANTER. 

Why, I'm nowhere ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Well, / ain't — so it doesn't matter ! But I don't mind 
giving you an hour now — for I flatter myself I've got 
you ! 

CHANTER, frightened, as she is going up. 

Don't go that yf3iy — wait ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 
Wait here? 

CHANTER, still more alarmed. 
No, wait there I (Pushing her to the lower door on the right.) Don't 

come out till we've gone to dinner ! 

Exit Mrs. FRESHVILLE, hustled out ; on which Chanter turns, deeply agitated, 
to meet Mrs. Doubleday. Re-enter Mrs. Doubleday from the hall, dressed 
for dinner. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Where's Mr. Bonsor? 

CHANTER. 

I haven't seen him. 



268 THE REPROBATE 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Still looking for that woman ? 

CHANTER, vague, on his gnanL 

That woman ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Why, Paul's dreadful connection. 

CHANTER. 

Oh yes ! (To himseu:) I wish she u*cre Paul's ! (Thinks an 

instant.) Perhaps she is I (Then breathless with the happy thought.) 

That photograph ! — she must be ! (Exultant.) Saved ! 

Re-enter Mr. Bonsor from the hall, dressed for dinner. 
MRS. DOUBLEDAY, to Mr. Bonsor. 

Did you see her ? 

MR. BONSOR. 

No, I hunted — but I had to dress. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

She'll come back — we'll catch her ! 

CHANTER, nervous. 

Oh, let's have dinner first ! 

MR. BONSOR. 
Where are the young people ? 

CHANTER, impatient, seeing Blanchb. 

Here's one of them — that's enough ! 

Re-enter Blanche Amber from the library. 



ACT FIRST 269 

MR. BONSOR. 
And Where's Pitt Brunt ? 

BLANCHE. 
And Where's Mr. Paul ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, reminded, cUpping her hand to her pocket 

The key's in my other dress — I quietly locked him in. 

BLANCHE, smiling. 

He must have escaped — he was here ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, alarmed. 

Here? 

BLANCHE. 

Ten minutes ago. 

MR. BONSOR, to Mrs. Doubledav, severe. 

You quietly locked him out ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Mercy — where is he then ? 

Re-enter Cubit from the hall. 
CUBIT, to Mr. BoNSOR. 

Dinner, sir. 

CHANTER, pressing, catching Mrs. Doubledav by the arm and hurrying 
her up to the hall. 

It doesn't matter — come ! 

Exeunt Captain Chanter and Mrs. Doubledav, and, hurrying after them, Mr. 
BoNSOR and Blanche. As Cubit is about to follow, re-enter Pitt Brunt 
from the lawn. ' . . • 



270 THE REPROBATE 

CUBIT. . 
Dinner, sir. 

PITT BRUNT, resentful 

IVe looked for you everywhere. 

CUBIT. 

Doing my 'air, sir. 

PITT BRUNT 

Where's that lady ? 

CUBIT, blank, giving it up. 

Showed herself out I 

PITT BRUNT. 

But Where's her bag ? 

CUBIT. 

No connection with the luggage, sir. 

PITT BRUNT, mystified. 

I give it up ! 

Exit Pitt Brunt to the hall. 
CUBIT, alone, glancing about him. 

Where is the blessed bag ? A liberal reward — (Pauses 

as he sees Mrs. Fresh villb.) 

Re-enter Mrs. Frbshvillb by the lower door on the right. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, giving Cubit, in a business-like way, as soon as she 
sees him, another sovereign with which she has already provided herself. 

Add that ! 



ACT FIRST 271 

CUBIT, with the sovereign. 

Sixpence back, ma'am ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

No — ^keep it ! 

CUBIT. 

For silence, ma'am ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

For anything you like ! 

CUBIT, to himself. 

Thirty-nine and six ! 

Exit Cubit to the hall. Re-enter Paul Doubleday from the garden. 
MRS. FRESHVILLE, before seeing Paul. 

But my reticule — with the dear old photo ? (Then as Paul 
appears.) Gracious powers — the original ! 

PAUL, staring, amazed, coming down. 

Nina? 

. MRS. FRESHVILLE, with a shriek, throwing herself into his arms. 

Dudley ! 



ACT SECOND 

Mr. Bonsor's drawing-room. Mr. Bonsor, at the table] on the left, 
busily hunting for something, lifting up one object after the other. 
Enter Cubit from the halL 

CUBIT. 
Did you ring, sir ? 

MR. BONSOR. 

Yes, I want a photograph — a photograph of Mr. Paul. 

CUBIT. 

Delighted to have him took, sir. 

MR. BONSOR. 
He has been " took," unfortunately ; and the result, which 
was placed upon this table yesterday, by Mrs. Double- 
day, has been surreptitiously removed. 

CUBIT. 

Never put my hand to anything, sir. 

MR. BONSOR. 
I wish you'd put your head ! I want Captain Chanter. 



ACT SECOND 273 

CUBIT. 
His photograph, sir? 

MR. BONSOR. 

His presence. 

CUBIT. 

Here it is, sir. 

Enter Captain Chanter from the haU ; to which exit Cubit. 
MR. BONSOR, opening drawers, to Chanter. 

Did you appropriate that photograph — the one Mrs. 
Doubleday showed you ? 

CHANTER, embarrassed. 

Oh, the picture of Paul ? 

MR. BONSOR. 

The picture of Dudley ! It has irrecoverably vanished. 

CHANTER. 

I put it back on the table. (To himself.) Nina recovered 
it? 

MR. BONSOR. 
Then who can have taken it ? 

CHANTER, thinking. 

Dudley ! 

MR. BONSOR. 

The record of his shame ? 

VOL. II ' T 



274 THE REPROBATE 

CHANTER, prompt. 

To cancel his shame. 

MR. BONSOR, severe. 

There must be no cancelling ! 

CHANTER. 

To annihilate the proof. 

• MR. BONSOR. 

There must be no annihilation. We'll get it back. 

CHANTER. 

ril get it back ! Perhaps youVe already heard from 
Mrs. Doubleday that IVe accepted onerous functions. 

MR. BONSOR. 

It was precisely on the subject of those functions that I 
desired to converse with you. Mrs. Doubleday has 
imparted to me her project of a second union. 

CHANTER. 

I hope you don't regard it as a defection. It doubles 
the guard ! 

MR. BONSOR, with dignity. 

The guard has hitherto been adequate. 

CHANTER. 

How can you say so in the face of our present alarm ? 



ACT SECOND 275 

MR. BONSOR, still with dignity. 

It's very good of you to share it ! 

CHANTER. 

I feel strongly that you require relief. 

MR. BONSOR, virtuous. 

IVe never asked for it I 

CHANTER. 

You're a Stoic — you're a hero ! But remember that 
Mrs. Doubleday's essentially a woman. 

MR. BONSOR. 

It's just what I've endeavoured to forget ! 

CHANTER. 

Such endeavours are vain — I never make them. 
(Looking at his watch.) Mrs. Doubleday's late — I'm waiting. 

MR. BONSOR. 

What are you waiting for ? 

CHANTER. 

To take Paul over. 

MR. BONSOR, blank. 

Over where ? 

CHANTER. 

To receive him from her hands. She commits him to 
me — ceremonially. 



276 THE REPROBATE 

MR. BONSOR. 
They're preparing, then, for the ceremony. 

CHANTER, grave. 

I've been preparing too. 

MR. BONSOR. 

In what manner ? 

CHANTER. 

By meditation. We hope youll assist at it. 

MR. BONSOR 

I'll not refuse to show you that I appreciate your 
singular zeal. The more so that it's manifested in a 
critical hour. 

CHANTER. 

It was just the crisis that appealed to me ! 

MR. BONSOR. 

Are you ready to meet it ? 

CHANTER. 

With your inspiring confidence ! 

MR. BONSOR, after an instant. 
You have it ! (They shake hands solemnly ; then Mr. Bonsor looks at 

his watch.) She must be decking him for the solemn rite. 

CHANTER. 

With ribbons and garlands ? 



ACT SECOND 277 

MR. BONSOR. 
With sackcloth and ashes. 

CHANTER, impatient. 

I want to get at him ! 

MR. BONSOR. 

It's my individual conviction that he has been got at ! 

CHANTER. 

You allude to last evening ? 

MR. BONSOR. 

While we were at dinner. Just after the member for 
Blackport had taken his place among us, we were 
startled by the sound of a remarkable concussion. It 
seemed to proceed from the drawing-room. 

CHANTER. 

Which we all invaded — to find it didn't. 

MR. BONSOR. 

All except Blanche. One of the parties to the encounter 
had already vanished, but Paul was on the spot 

CHANTER. 

Declaring — ^when examined — that he hadn't laid eyes 
on any one. 

MR. BONSOR. 

It's the first time, remarkable to say, that he has ever 
told an untruth. 



278 THE REPROBATE 

CHANTER. 
Are you sure it ts an untruth ? 

MR. BONSOR. 

He was pale, agitated, unnatural. 

CHANTER. 

He didn't wish to compromise the lady ! 

MR. BONSOR. 

Hadn't she compromised him ? 

CHANTER. 

He has* no character to lose. But the question shall 
be probed to the bottom. 

MR BONSOR. 

Please probe it ! 

Re-enter Cubit from the hall. 
CUBIT, announcing. 

Mr. Pitt Brunt ! 

Enter Pitt Brunt from the hall. 
MR. BONSOR. 

Have you brought your luggage ? 

PITT BRUNT. 

It consists mainly of my quotations — twenty volumes 
of Hansard. 



ACT SECOND 279 

CHANTER. 

Your quotations must be singularly copious ! 

MR. BONSOR, to Chanter. 

He will contribute to those of posterity. (To Cubit.) 
Arrange the twenty volumes. 

PITT BRUNT, to Cubit. 

Chronologically ! 

Exit Cubit to the hall. 
MR. BONSOR, to Chanter. 

The member for Blackport is to meet his electors. 

PITT BRUNT. 

I'm writing my speech — and trying it on Mr. Bonsor. 
CHANTER. 

I hope itil be a comfortable fit. Ill not interfere with 
the process. 

Exit Captain Chanter by the lower door on the right. 
MR. BONSOR, to Brunt. 

It will save time to have you in the house. And then 
there's another reason. 

PITT BRUNT, as Blanche appears. 
Here's the other reason ! (Enter Blanche Amber from the hall 
with a railway novel in her hand.) Good moming. I've COme tO 

Stay ! 



28o THE REPROBATE 

BLANCHE. 
I'm very happy, this morning, to feel that that's just 
what I've done ! 

PITT BRUNT. 
Isn't it a remarkably interesting house ? 

BLANCHE. 

Fascinating ! (Mr. Bonsok and Pitt Bruht look at each other, and 
Rlanchs conadcn a moment the cover of her railway noveL Then she speaks 

ahmptiy.) Dear uncle ! (Holding out her hook.) Is that im- 
proper ? 

MR. BONSOR, with the hook, looking at the cover with his glasses. 

A lady and gentleman, engaged-^ 

BLANCHE. 

Oh, they're not engaged ! 

PITT BRUNT, interested. 

What are they doing ? 

MR. BONSOR. 

Embracing ! (DuWous, disapproving, while he still looks,) If they're 
not engaged — 

PITT BRUNT. 

They ought to be ! (To blanche.) Every one who isn't 
ought to be. 

BLANCHE. 

From a sense of duty ? Tm afraid I've no conscience. 
(To Mr. BoNsoR.) May I lend that book to Mr. Paul ? 



ACT SECOND 281 

MR. BONSOR, looking at her severely over his glasses. 

The question exemplifies your deficiency ! 

^ PITT BRUNT. 

You may lend it to me, 

BLANCHE, taking the book back. 

You wouldn't understand it ! 

MR. BONSOR. 

YouVe got your Hansard. 

Re-enter Cubit from the hall. 
CUBIT, to Brunt. 

I think IVe set them straight, sir. 

MR. BONSOR. 

Chronologically ? 

CUBIT, blank an instant. 

No, sir, on their sides. 

MR. BONSOR, to Brunt. 

Go and see. 

PITT BRUNT, smiling to Blanche. 

I must make them sit up ! 

Exit Pitt Brunt to the hall. Exit Cubit. 
MR. BONSOR. 

He makes the House ! 

BLANCHE, tossing down her book. 

Isn't he supposed to know anything f 



282 THE REPROBATE 

MR. BONSOR, who has taken up the book. 

The member for Blackport ? 

BLANCHE. 

The prisoner of Chillon ! 

MR. BONSOR. 

He's supposed to know too much ! The harm's done, 
but we endeavour to prevent its spreading. (He goes to the 

cabinet on the right, opens it and, seeing Mrs. Frbshvillb's reticule, which he 
has put away there, considers an instant, and then, as if with a hsq&gt;py thought, 
plumps the booklnto it. To himself.) JuSt do for her / 

BLANCHE, who has not seen this proceeding ; musing, objecting. 

He seems after all to do nothing ! 

MR. BONSOR. triumphant. 

What did he do last night ? 

BLANCHE. 
I haven't the least idea. (Then after an instant.) But I 

should like to help you ! 

MR. BONSOR, suspicious. 

Everyone would like to " help " me ! 

BLANCHE. 

You must double the guard ! 

MR. BONSOR. 
That's what they all say ! 



ACT SECOND 2S3 

BLANCHE. 
It shows there's something in it ! 

MR. BONSOR. 
There may be something in it, but it's not what I sent 
for you for. 

BLANCHE, turning away with a groan. 

Ah, dear uncle, I know what you sent for me for ! 

MR. BONSOR. 

The member for Blackport's the Idol of the North ! 

BLANCHE. 

The idol should remain in his temple. 

MR. BONSOR, indignant. 

What would the House do without him ? 

BLANCHE. 

Perhaps it would wake up ! 

\ 

MR. BONSOR. 

The House is his temple 1 He's the young man of the 
hour. 

BLANCHE. 

Do you mean of the dinner-hour ? 

MR. BONSOR. 

There's not a question of the day that he has not made 
his own. 



284 THE REPROBATE 

BLANCHE. 
Well, dear uncle, as Fm not the question of the day — 

MR. BONSOR. 

You would none the less have your appointed place. 
His private life would be worthy of his public 

BLANCHE. 

But should / be worthy of his private ? 

MR. BONSOR. 

Let him read you his momentous speech. 

BLANCHE. 

Is it very long? 

MR. BONSOR. 

Not yet ; but it will be. It's growing fast. 

BLANCHE, smiling. 

Then I'll take it when it's little, (in another tone.) But, all 
the same, I'm interested in Mr. Paui&gt; 

MR. BONSOR, disconcerted. 

"Interested"? 

BLANCHE. 

I regard him as an object of charity. 

MR. BONSOR. 

Why so ? His wants are provided for ! 



ACT SECOND 285 

BLANCHE. 
There are wants and wants. Why not let him have — 

MR. BONSOR, as she pauses, thinking. 

Let him have what ? 

BLANCHE. 

One's scraps of leisure — one's ideas of life. 

MR. BONSOR. 

He's not a person for you to meet on a social basis. 

BLANCHE. 

Oh, I want to approach him in a missionary spirit. 

MR. BONSOR. 
You won't convert him. 

BLANCHE. 

Perhaps not. (Smiling.) But I'll clothe him ! 

MR. BONSOR. 

That is the first proper step ; but have you the material ? 

BLANCHE, laughing. 

Yards and yards and yards ! 

Re-enter Captain Chanter from the lower door on the right. 
CHANTER. 

Have they come ? 



286 THE REPROBATE 

MR. BONSOR. 
They've come. 

Enter Mrs. Doubleday and Paul from the hall while Blanche and 
Chanter converse. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, perceiving this. 

Captain ! (Chanter instantly quits Blanche and comes to her, a move- 
ment which leaves Paul exposed. As Blanche moves a little nearer to Paul 
Mrs. Doubleday resumes.) Paul ! 

PAUL, startled, coming down to her. 

Mamma ? 

Re-enter from the hall Pitt Brunt, with several volumes of Hansard under 
one arm and a portfolio under the other. 

PITT BRUNT, to Mr. Bonsor. 

May I work in the library ? 

MR. BONSOR, assenting. 

My niece will assist you. 

PITT BRUNT. 

Oh, Miss Amber ! 

MR. BONSOR. 

She's eager to listen to your speech. 

PITT BRUNT. 
She shall t (Then looking round complacently at the company.) 

Perhaps you'd all like to listen. 



ACT SECOND 287 

PAUL, very prompt. 

Mamma, would it be safe for me f 

PITT BRUNT, smiling. 

It wouldn't if you had to reply to me ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

He's never allowed to reply ! 

CHANTER, to Brunt. 

An arrangement is pending by which I shall henceforth 
answer for him. But I'm afraid that, for the present, 
we must occupy ourselves exclusively with this arrange- 
ment. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Before we enter upon it, I beg Mr. Bonsor to mention — 

MR. BONSOR, blank, while she pauses as if from delicacy. 

To mention — ? 

CHANTER. 

The nature of the connection about to be formed. 

BLANCHE, eager. 

Matrimonial ? 

PAUL, struck, echoing. 

Matrimonial ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, with reprobation. 

Paul! 



288 THE REPROBATE 

BLANCHE, wondering. 

Is that not the nature of the connection ? 

MR. BONSOR. with reprobation. 

Blanche ! 

BLANCHE, to Paul, snuling. 

But it must be either one thing or the other, musn't it ? 

PAUL. 

Fm never allowed to reply. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

You will therefore receive without comment — 

MR. BONSOR, as she hesitates. 

As / have done — 

CHANTER. 

The news of your mother's intended marriage — 

BLANCHE, as he hesiutes. 

To Captain Chanter, Fm sure. 

PAUL, struck, precipitate. 

The Captain ? — By jingo ! 

MR. BONSOR, privately, to Mrs. Doublbday. 

He hadn^t taken it in ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

We never crossed the line. 



ACT SECOND 289 

MR. BONSOR. 
It excites a train of thought. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

That was just our scruple. 

MR. BONSOR. 

He thinks it reheves him. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, emphatic. 

It doesn't ! 

PITT BRUNT, gay, to Mrs. Doubledav. 
I'm sorry for Mr. Bonsor ! (To Mr. Bonsor, summarily prcsentbg 
the Hansards in a pile.) JuSt take theSC. 

MR. BONSOR, vague, but receiving the Hansards. 

What am I to do with them ? 

PITT BRUNT, prompt. 

Verify. 

MR. BONSOR. 

Csin*t you verify? 

PITT BRUNT. 

I must give my attention to Miss Amber.

YouVe been trying that all my life ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

This time I shall succeed. I deliver you to the 
Captain. 

CHANTER, passing between Mrs. Doubleoay and Paul. 

I beg to acknowledge receipt ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, to Paul. 

You're to look up to him as youVe looked up to me, 

CHANTER. 

I become, as it were, your second mother. 

MR. BONSOR. 

As IVe been, as it were, your second father ! 

PAUL,^ resigned, bewildered. 

I seem to have plenty of relations ! 



ACT SECOND 291 

BLANCHE. 
Shouldn't you like a sister thrown in? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

The fkmily is quite large enough ! (Privately to Chanter.) 
I wanted her to take it in ! 

CHANTER. 
She shall take it in ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, who has extracted a small coin from herportemonnaie. 

Let me hand you this. 

CHANTER, with the coin, vague. 

Sixpence ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

His allowance. 

CHANTER. 

It doesn't pass through his hands ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

We apply it to some benevolent object. 

CHANTER, pocketing the sixpence. 

It shall be devoted to a worthy one ! 

MR. BONSOR, to Chanter. 

You'll find your place no sinecure. 

CHANTER, virtuous. 

No — but Mrs. Doubleday will breathe !

The Idol of the North ! 

Exit Mr. Bonsor to the hall with the books. 
PITT BRUNT, gracious, opening the door of the library to Blanche. 

He's ready to mount his pedestal 



ACT SECOND 293 

BLANCHE. 

Do you want me to hold it while you get on ? 

PITT BRUNT, smiling. 

It won't run away ! 

BLANCHE. 

I wish you would ! 

PITT BRUNT, arch, at the door of the library. 

For you to run after me ? 

Exit Pitt Brunt. 

CHANTER, looking from Blanche to Paul a moment, then refleaing, 
deciding and taking two half-crowns out of his pocket. 

Let me hand you this ! 

PAUL, with the money, surprised. 

Five shillings ? 

CHANTER. 

Your allowance. 

PAUL. 

Four and sixpence too much ! 

CHANTER. 

I change the system — I increase the sum !

Mamma wouldn't have left me with you !

I wouldn't have asked him 1

Yes, isn't it awful ? 

BLANCHE. 
Ah, don't say that when I'm fighting at your side ! 

PAUL. 
Thanks — ^but you do undermine me ! 

BLANCHE. 
Why, if I asked him to go it was on purpose to prop 
you up. 

PAUL. 

It's just when you prop me, you know, that I seem 
most to come down 1 

BLANCHE. 

Don't think of me as a mere young lady ; think of me 
as an invalid's attendant — as a doctor — as a district 
nurse.

A sort of sister of charity, eh ? 

BLANCHE. 

Yes, but not in the least of a strict order. 

PAUL. 

Strict orders are issued to me daily ! 

BLANCHE. 
Oh, I shall be easy with you, for I know you're in trouble. 

PAUL, anxious, looking round. 

Indeed I am in trouble ! 

BLANCHE. 

Your wild past comes back to you. 

PAUL. 

It came back last night. But it only stayed a minute. 

BLANCHE. 

Such minutes must be wonderful ! 

PAUL. 

They do upset one !

They make you feel you live !

Yes, but in the tomb of my reputation.

Ah, you're not buried ; your tomb is open to the sky. 
You see the sun and the stars ; you feel the wind and

No hug for Nina ? 

PAUL, checking her with his finger to his lips. 

When we hug they hear it !

Distinctly. They rushed in. Fortunately you had

Yes, my boy, you did bundle me !

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

A pound a visit. 

PAUL. 

It comes pretty high. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

About the same as a high-class doctor. But, my dear 

child, I consider you worth it ! (Looking at him a moment.) 

You do look so fresh ! 

PAUL, uneasy, distressed. 

Nina, I beg you not to allude to my appearance !

It was over long ago !

But they ain't, eh ? 

PAUL. 

I hope not. I'm trying to be good. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

So am I ; but I'm not very sure it pays ! 

PAUL, struck, suppliant. 

Ah, Nina, don't say that 1 



302 THE REPROBATE 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Why not, if it's true? You live up to a standard 
because you think some others do; and after you've 
had all the worry — 

PAUL, as she pauses. 

Yes, Nina? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Why, you find they don't ! 

PAUL, wondering. 

Don't they really ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

See what an awful sell ! You go spinning along the 
path of virtue, and if at the end of the run you happen 
to look back, what do you see ? 

PAUL. 

I never look back ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

All of them sitting down ! 

PAUL. 

I never sit down ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Partaking freely of refreshment. 

PAUL. 

1 never partake ! 



ACT SECOND 303 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

No more do I ; but I feel the want of it ! 

PAUL. 

You have your equivalent : you've acquired the habit of 
virtue. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Yes, that's the worst of it : youVe got to go on. 

PAUL. 

Let me earnestly entreat you to do so I 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

I'm going on ; that's what has brought me here ! 

PAUL. 

Yes, on the railroad of virtue this is certainly a lively 
station ! But how did you find it out ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

By the aid of the police. 

PAUL, alarmed. 

The police ? Are they after me ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

You, my dear fellow ? I didn't come for you ! 

PAUL, blank. 

Who did you come for ? 



304 THE REPROBATE 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Ain't there another rascal on the premises ? 

PAUL, amazed. 

Mr. Bonsor? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 
Try again ! 

PAUL. 

Captain Chanter ? (Then perceiving her assent.) The police 
are after him i 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Not now — but / am ! It's better. 

PAUL. 

What do you want of him ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 
I want to marry him. 

PAUL. 

Marry him ? Why, he's engaged ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Right you are — to me, 

PAUL, stupefied. 

You and my mother ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Is she your mother ? 



ACT SECOND 305 

PAUL. 
My stepmother. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

That monster ? 

PAUL. 

Don't abuse her, Nina — she's my guardian ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Your guardian ? (Struck.) Are you the common object ? 

PAUL, blank. 

The common object ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

That I heard about yesterday — such a peculiar case. 

PAUL. 

1 am 3, peculiar case ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

You're vicious, eh ? 

PAUL. 

Fundamentally ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, dubious. 

So bad you require fufo of them ? 

PAUL. 

I require three — with the Captain. 

VOL. II X 



3o6 THE REPROBATE 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, amaied 

Is he one ? 

PAUL. 

He looks after my morals. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

And who looks after his ? 

PAUL, wondering, artless. 

Why, I thought they were perfect ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

So did I. But they ain't ! 

PAUL, thinking. 

That won't suit Mamma ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Then let her drop him ! 

PAUL. 

That won't suit him I 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

He's too particular. Leave him to me, 

PAUL, anxious. 

And what'U you do with him ? 



ACT SECOND 307 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 
Do with him ? (After an instant, considering.) ScC hc IctS 

you alone. 

PAUL, anxious. 

Then what'U become of me ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

I'll look after you myself! 

PAUL, astonished. 

After both of us ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 
It will be all one job ! (After looking at him a moment.) As 

for you — I don't believe it ! 

PAUL. 

Don't believe what ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Why, that you're a peculiar case. 

PAUL. 

Then look at the evidence ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Hang the evidence ! Try — and see. 

PAUL. 
Try? Try what? 



3o8 THE REPROBATE 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Try everything ! 

PAUL. 

Why, everything's wrong 1 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

You are, my dear, to begin with ! Everything's right ! 

PAUL, bewUdered. 

Everything's deuced awkward, at any rate ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLK 

Your dear old face, as you say that, comes back to me ! 

PAUL. 

Don't let it, Nina — ^for heaven's sake send it away ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

With that sweet little waxed moustache. What have 
you done with the ends ? 

PAUL. 

They've followed those of all the candles and cigars ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

The burnt-out fires? — the withered flowers? You 
always had a lovely buttonhole. 

PAUL. 

I've given up buttonholes — they look too dissolute. 



ACT SECOND 309 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Dissolute ? — the flowers of the field ? I never heard of 
such rot ! 

PAUL. 

Neither have I, Nina ! But they wouldn't like me to 
say so. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

" They " ? Mamma and the Captain ? 

PAUL. 

Perhaps the Captain wouldn't object — 

MRS.*FRESHVILLE. 

I should like to see him ! 

PAUL. 

But such an expression wouldn't go unrebuked by Mr. 
Bonsor. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

The old busybody who chased you to Paris ? 

PAUL, prompt. 

Oh, he was my father ! (Then struck.) Gracious, what 
have I said? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

The simple truth. They did make a rumpus about 
nothing ! 

PAUL. 

Not exactly nothing ! 



3IO THE REPROBATE 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Nothing worth speaking of ! 

PAUL. 

I don't speak of it ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

But they do still, eh ? 

PAUL. 

To every one they see ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

To the Captain, do you suppose ? 

PAUL. 

Oh, above all to the Captain ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, after consideration. 

Well, that's no matter. He doesn't know it was me. 

PAUL. 

He'll find it out. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

I don't care if he does ! 

PAUL. 

Not if he wants to marry you ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

He doesn't ! 



ACT SECOND 311 

PAUL, reasoning, perplexed. 

Still — if he*s engaged — ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

He's engaged to your mamma. If he can stand your 
mamma, he can stand me. 

PAUL. 
But how can he marry you both ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Trust him to manage it — if it's necessary ! But it ain't 
necessary. 

PAUL. 

I'm glad of that ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

He'll chuck your mamma. 

PAUL, rueful. 

So that I shall receive her on the rebound ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, struck, compassionate. 

No, that won't do, you poor dear, will it ? (After another 
instant, sociable.) We did hit it ofF, me and you, didn't we, 
Dud? 

PAUL. 

I confess I was rather afraid of you. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE 

You've got over that, I hope ! 



3ia THE REPROBATE 

PAUL. 

I think I'm gaining confidence. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

So am I, though you gave me, last night, a turn. 

PAUL. 

I didn't sleep a wink ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Nor me, fancy ! I thought of the old days — of the way 
I used to sing to you ! 

PAUL, beguiled. 

Do you remember your old songs ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, eager. 

Should you like to hear one ? 

PAUL, suddenly alarmed. 

Heavens, no ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, as he goes up, on his guard. 

They're out of fashion now ; they've got a new lot ! 

PAUL, coming down. 

Are you still at the Waterloo ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Dear, no ; bless the old shop ! 



ACT SECOND 3i3 

PAUL, after an instant, gentle. 

Your voice was very sweet, Nina. 

MRS. ^FRESHVILLE. 

So was yours, old chap. Do you still sing ? 

PAUL, aghast. 

Sing ? Why, I scarcely speak ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

I remember how little you thought of your own powers. 
You only wanted me to develop ! 

PAUL. 

I'm bound to say you did develop ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Through the course of instruction you so liberally pro- 
vided. It was for that we went to Paris. 

PAUL, recalling, recognising. 

Yes, it was simply for that ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Our musical studies. Where was the awful harm ? 

PAUL, thinking. 

After all, where was it ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

We simply went in for a thorough course. 



314 THE REPROBATE 

PAUL. 
We thought It our duty to hear what they were doing. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. reminiscent, wbtfuL 

Ah, they do such a lot ! What was that place ? The 
Alcazar! 

PAUL. 

And that other ? The Eldorado ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

And the Valentino ! 

PAUL. 

And the Solferino ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

That was where at last they collared us ! 

PAU L, starting, seeing Chanter. 

They've collared us again ! 

Re-enter Captain Chanter, with a yellow-covered French novel and a box of 
cigars, by the lower door on the right. 

CHANTER, bland. 

Good morning, Mrs. Freshville, 

PAUL, surprised. 

Is that your name now ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, ominous, looking at Chanter. 

Not the one he generally uses ! Didn't I mention that 
IVe been married ? 



ACT SECOND 315 

CHANTER, smiling. 

You must have had so much else to say ! (To Paul.) 
She belongs to the category of irresistible widows. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

But not to the most irresistible part of it. (With intensity, to 
Chanter.) Those with five thousand a year. 

PAUL, to Chanter ; still meek and respectful, but explanatory and ludd. 

I've had the pleasure of some previous acquaintance 
with Mrs. Freshville, 

CHANTER, genial. 

My dear fellow, I know all about it ! 

PAUL, to Mrs. Freshville, rueful. 

He knows all about it ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

I don't care a rap what he knows ! 

CHANTER, frank and gay. 
I shall make you care ! (To Paul, sociable, handing the cigar-box.) 

Have a Regalia ? 

PAUL, looking at the cigars hard an instant, then hard at Chanter, as if to 
fathom his tortuous ways. 

What will Mamma say ? 



3i6 THE REPROBATE 

CHANTER, smiling, tempting. 

I won't tell her ! (Paul, hesitating, takes a cigar out of the case, turns 
away with it and stands a moment looking at it. Chanter, meanwhile, selects 
one for himself. Paul, suddenly, with a nervous movement, jerks away his 
own cigar, tosses it on a table and goes up, uneasily, nervously. Chanter, 
lighting a cigar, continues to Mrs. Freshvillb.) Shall I offer yOU 

one? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, with her hand on her pocket. 

I've got my cigarettes ! (Feeling.) No, I haven't ; they're 

in my reticule. (Looking, with renewed despair, about her.) Where 

the dickens is it ? 

CHANTER, cool, without moving. 

Don't mind I'll find it ! (Then to Paul.) I say, here's a 
book for you. 

PAUL, eager, coming down. 

A book ? 

CHANTER, handing him his yellow-Covered volume. 

A little French novel ! 



Zola? 



Zola! 



PAUL, timid, taking the book. 



CHANTER, puffing his cigar. 



PAUL, gazing at the cover. 

What will Mamma say ? 



ACT SECOND 317 

CHANTER. 



I won't tell her ! 



Patil turns away slowly, with his novel, as he has done with his cigar, and 
looks in the same way at the cover without opening it. Then he tosses it 
down, as he has tossed his cigar, and goes up, with the same nervous move- 
ment, to stand an instant at the window and look out at the lawn. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, seated, to Chanter. 

Ain't you ashamed, you horrid thing ? 

CHANTER. 
Ain't you, you designing woman ? (Then as he draws a pack of 
cards from his pocket and holds it out to Paul.) I Say, choOSe a Card. 

PAUL, alert, coming down. 

A card? 

CHANTER. 

One of these, 

PAUL. 

What will Mamma say ? 

CHANTER 

I won't tell her ! 

PAUL, looking at the cards, fascinated but hesitating. 

What are you doing ? 

CHANTER. 

A little trick. Take any you like. (As Paul draws out a card.) 
What is it? 

PAUL. 

The Queen of Hearts ! 



'3i8 THE REPROBATE 

MR&amp; FRESHVILLE, seated. 

Graceful allusion to me / 

CHANTER. 

Please keep it till I tak^ it back. 

Paul turns away in the same manner as before, stops, looks irresolutely at the 
card, then gets rid of it as he has done of the cigar and the book. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, to Chanter, nodding at his pack. 

My old pack ? 

CHANTER, vague. 

Yours? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

The one we generally use. 

CHANTER. 
I just sent out to buy it. (Then after he has pbiced the cards well 
in evidence on the table.) Dudley ! 

PAUL, more dryly, coming down. 

Sir? 

CHANTER. 

Will you do me a favour ? You'll find on the table in 
my room — 

PAUL, anxious, as Chanter pauses. 

I shall find—? 

CHANTER. 

A flask of brandy. 



ACT SECOND 319 

PAUL, blank. 

What shall I do with it ? 

CHANTER. 

Anything you like ! 

PAUL, horrified. 

Captain, have mercy on me ! 

CHANTER. 
Then bring it here to me ! (As Paul looks at Wm in a silcm 
appeal, he adds.) Do get it, old fcUoW ! 

PAUL, divided, to Mrs. FrBShvillb. 

Shall I get it ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Oh, I don't care what mamma says ! 

PAUL, after another instant, snapping his fingers. 

No more then do I ! 

Exit Paul Doubleday to the hall. 
MRS. FRESHVILLE, rising, abrupt. 

Are the invitations out ? 

CHANTER. 

I haven't the faintest idea what you mean ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

For your marriage to that old dragon. 



320 THE REPROBATE 

CHANTER. 
I suppose I may keep a secret — after discovering that 
you've nurtured one for years. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

All the more that yours is so horrid I Dudley liked 
me, and I liked him, and I'm not ashamed of it I was 
grateful to him for his interest in my voice. 

CHANTER, sarcastic. 

Oh, your voice ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Don't sniff at it — you were glad enough to hear it ! 

CHANTER. 

And to which of us, this morning, have you come here 
to sing ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

You'll understand when I tell you that though last 
night I had engaged my room at the inn, I went back 
to town for my music. 

CHANTER. 

Your music ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Perhaps I ought to say yours ! Your notes of hand. 

CHANTER. 

The stuff I wrote you? (Thinking.) You can't make a 
scene with my letters now. 



ACT SECOND 321 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Why ain't it a happy moment ? 

CHANTER. 

Simply because you'll do for Dudley. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

I don't mind that — if I do for you ! 

CHANTER 

Where are the few lines I inadvertently traced ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

There are enough, of them to stuff out my pocket. 

(As he looks at her, up and down, askance.) YoU needn't CFOUCh 

for a spring — I'll fight for them ! 

CHANTER, nervous, throwing away his cigar. 

You're criminally vulgar ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 
I often think it's a comfort ! But I feel as if I had a 
small family in my pocket, and now I should like my 
reticule. 



Chanter goes to the cupboard on the right, in which Mr. Bonsor has placed 
the reticule, and takes it out. He brings it to her and she receives it and 
opens it. She pulls out Blanche's railway novel, which Mr. Bonsor has 
put into it, and looks at the book with surprise. Then she flings it down 
on the table. 

That book's not mine !

322 THE REPROBATE 

CHANTER, taking up the book. 
Who's is it? (Reading the name on the title page.) Blanche 

Amber? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, who has fumbled in the reticule, in dismay. 

And the photo's gone ! 

CHANTER. 
The photo ? 

I MRS. FRESHVILLE, looking about her, vexed. 

Dudley's ! 

CHANTER. 

Was it in there ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

I carry it about 

CHANTER. 

And what do you do with mine ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Lock it up at home ! Where is the confounded thing ? 

CHANTER, still with Blanche's book. 

Some one obviously sneaked it. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, vague. 

Who the mischief — ? 

CHANTER. 

The person who left this instead. 



ACT SECOND 323 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

That nasty book ? Who is the brute ? 

CHANTER. 

The brute is Miss Blanche Amber. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, recalling. 

The girl who arrived yesterday ? 

CHANTER. 

Just in time to grab it ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

The one who's engaged to the public man ? 

CHANTER. 

The member for Blackport ? They're not engaged 
quite yet. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

He's awfully spoony. 

CHANTER. 

Well, s/ie isn't ! (After a moment.) I'll get the photograph 
back from her. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Very good of you. Get it immediately. 

CHANTER. 

You must give me time — she'll cleave to it ! 



324 THE REPROBATE 

MRS. FRESHVILLK 

Cleave to my property — ^the horrid little thief? 

CHANTER. 

You must allow for her feelings ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. vague. 

What feelings, pray ? 

CHANTER. 

Why, she's in love with him I 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

With Dudley ? Since when ? 

CHANTER, with assurance. 

Since yesterday ! He makes them toe the mark ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Does he make them steal ? 

CHANTER 

He makes them do anything ! 

He goes up rapidly to the window as soon as he has spoken ; while Mrs. 
FRESHVILLE sinks slowly again into the chair from which she has risen, 
and, with her reticule open on her knees, transfers to it mechanically, with 
an air of intense preoccupation, one by one, a dozen loose letters that she 
has taken from her pocket. She takes them out successively, looking at 
the superscriptions. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, who has counted the letters and fastened her reticule. 

Thirteeft, and five telegrams ! 



ACT SECOND 325 

CHANTER, who has stood uneasily at the window, coming down, looking 
at his watch. 

Give me half an hour, and I'll bring you the photo at 
the inn ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, rising again, smiling, with the reticule on her arm. 

In exchange for your letters ? Too dear ! 

CHANTER. 

Oh, bother my letters — do what you like with them ! 
Make any row your bad taste may suggest, but for 
heaven's sake let it be a row that won't hurt Dudley ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 
Hurt him — how ? 

CHANTER. 
By showing that you and he are at it again ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

We ain't at it again ! 

CHANTER. 

You present an appearance of it that won't improve his 
situation. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

His situation's a farce I 

CHANTER. 

So it is, but you must sit the farce out. 



326 THE REPROBATE 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

And you ? Were you sitting it out just now ? 

CHANTER. 

Oh, Tm in the performance. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

As the leading villain ? You corrupt his innocence ? 

CHANTER. 

His innocence is a thin veneer. Scratch the Russian 
and you find the Tartar — scratch Paul and you find 
Dudley ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Well, if you scratch him again I'll scratch you^ I can 
promise you ! 

CHANTER. 

I'm weak with him — I humour him — I spoil him : all 
that I admit. But that's nothing compared to the 
mess that you'll make for him by compromising him. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, after a moment. 

You're a mass of deceit, but I don't see what you'll 
gain by not bringing me the photo. 

CHANTER, pressing, watchful. 

I swear to you I'll bung it in half an hour. I hear 
some one coming ! 



ACT SECOND 327 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, thinking. 

Poor dear old Dud ! (Then to Chanter.) It's a pity you're 
such a fiend ! 

CHANTER, pleading, feverish. 

Don\ you be one — don't sacrifice him ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, looking at her watch. 

In half an hour ? 

CHANTER. 

To the minute ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

You're unspeakable — but I've got you ^re / (She slaps her 

reticule triumphantly and goes up.) 

CHANTER, who is up before her, listening by the door of the hall and 
checking her. 

Wait! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, indicating the lower door on the right. 

I won't go in there again ! 

CHANTER, passing quickly to the window. 

This way ! It's an escape ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, as she goes; warning. 

Not (or you/ 

Exit Mrs. FRESHVILLE to the lawn. 
CHANTER, alone, exhausted but exultant. 

She has "got" me, eh? Not quite so tight as I've

To yield to Mamma ?

No, tMt was inevitable. 

PAUL. 

So I've always found it ! 

CHANTER. 

I succumbed — originally — to Nina.

It wasn't original ! Where did you meet her ? 

CHANTER, waving away inquiries. 

Oh, in society ! She has my written vows.

Oh, yours don't matter !

Don't they, though !

How on earth can I save you ? 

CHANTER. 

As I tell you, by squaring her. 

PAUL, vague. 

Squaring Mrs. Doubleday? 

CHANTER. 
Squaring Mrs. Freshville ! (More agiuted the more he thinks.) 

It's quite too awful ! 

PAUL, considering. 

How far have you gone with her ? 

CHANTER. 

With Mrs. Freshville ? Very far indeed. I once went 
to Brighton. 

PAUL. 

Oh, / went to Paris ! 

CHANTER. 

I know you did ; so you can feel for me ! (Going up.) 
Keep her quiet ! 

PAUL. 

Where are you going ?

CHANTER, with wUd gestures. 

Away — away ! 

PAUL. 
Who then will keep me quiet ? 

CHANTER. 

You mustn't be quiet ; you must act ! 

PAUL, staring, wondering. 

Act? 

CHANTER. 

Save me ! By-bye ! 

Exit Chanter rapidly to the hall. 
PAUL, alone, still blank. 

That's all very well ; but who'll save me ? (He moves about 

during the rest of his soliloquy, looking round him, wonderingly, interrogatively, 
as he sifts his situation in his mind, taking up successively and laying down 
again the different objects he mentions.) I'm In dreadful danger, I 

suppose ! I must be, for I'm face to face with every- 
thing that, for years, I've been taught to dread — Aave 
dreaded. Tobacco, cards, wine, (then taking up the French novel) 
women ! Here they are — all in a row ! (Looking round him.) 
The real thing — and I'm alone with them ! I'm therefore 
free, ain't I ? free as I haven't been since — Ah, when 
was it ? It seems only yesterday ; yet it seems another 

life ! (With the different objects again.) Womeu, wiuC, Cards, 
tobacco ! (As he tosses the cigar into the box again.) Temptation, 

ain't it ? Yes, it must be : what else can it be ? I'm 
tempted ! The danger's right here at last — the danger

of the happy chance ! Well, the happy chance is just 
what I can't resist. (After a moment.) Is it, indeed ? Pray, 

why can't I ? (Standing off with his hands in his pockets, looking at the 

different things.) Bccausc I'm the slavc of my passions, 
and ray passions, alas, are awful ! (Taking up the flask of Kquor.) 
This, for instance — this is one of my passions. (He has 

uncorked the flask ; he smells it) Do I ycam for it ? Somchow 

I don't feel as if I did ! Could I even raise it to my 
lips ? (After an instant) What's the matter with me that I 

can't? (Still with the flask in his hand.) Tm wickcd I'm 

weak — I can't be trusted ; and yet my funny fate takes 
it into her head to trust me ! She treats me all of a 
sudden with flattering confidence. (Thinking.) It may 
be a trap of my funny fate. But if it's a trap, I ain't 
caught ! I am resisting ; I have resisted. (Following up 
his induction.) I ain't SO bad, then, now ; I must be getting 

better ! (StiU standing with the uncorked flask in his hand, he sees Pitt 
Brunt. Re-enter Pitt Brunt from the library ; to whom, as the idea last 
uttered comes over him, he breaks out spontaneously, joyously, artlessly.) I 

say. Brunt, I'm getting better ! 



Pitt Brunt, with his pen stuck into his ear, surprised at the image Paul 
presents with his uncorked flask, approaches him as if supposing him intoxi- 
cated. He takes the flask from him and smells it ; then, in horror at its 
contents, replaces it in his hand, looking at him with high superiority. 



PITT BRUNT. 
On brandy ? (He crosses to the lower door on the right, where he pauses 
an instant and gives Paul another look of shocked reprobation.) Out of 

the very bottles ? 

Exit Pitt Brunt by the lower door on the right. 



ACT SECOND 333 

PAUL, alone, stares, reflects a moment, then corks and puts down hb flask 
with a sigh of resignation, taking up mechanically the French novel. 

No one will ever believe it ! 

Re-enter Blanche Amber from the library. 
BLANCHE, at the door. 

Are you still alone ? 

PAUL. 

More alone than ever. 

BLANCHE. 

Then I'll come in. 

PAUL. 

Do ; he won't mind ! 

BLANCHE. 

Do you mean the member for Blackport ? 

PAUL. 

Oh no, not your keeper. Mine ! 
BLANCHE. 

Mine has left me too ; gone to my uncle for an idea. 

PAUL. 

Couldn't you give him one ? 

BLANCHE. 

1 gave him twenty, but he was afraid of them all. 

PAUL, smiling. 

I fancy you've some terrible ideas ; eh. Miss Amber ? 



334 THE REPROBATE 

BLANCHE. 
Not SO bad as some of yours, Mr. Paul ! 

PAUL. 

Oh, you exaggerate mine ! 

BLANCHE. 

Scarcely, when you've confessed to so mapy ! 

PAUL, embarrassed. 

Yes, I've made a clean breast ! 

BLANCHE. 

Don't dissimulate, then : keep it up ! 

PAUL, vague. 

Keep it up ? 

BLANCHE. 

Your honourable frankness. Your desperate candour. 

PAUL. 

It does win me your sympathy ? 

BLANCHE. 

As nothing else could ! 

PAUL, after an instant, resolute. 

Then I will keep it up. 

BLANCHE. 

There's plenty of it, whenever you require it. 



ACT SECOND 335 

PAUL. 
I should like to take it all, and keep it for ever ! 

BLANCHE, smiling. 

Take it in instalments — a dose every day. 

PAUL. 

Then such a person as me isn't repulsive to you ? 

BLANCHE. 

Repulsive — in your lonely grandeur ? 

PAUL. 

Oh, Miss Amber, Vm lonely, but I'm not particularly 
grand ! I'm a kind of moral leper, with a warning cow- 
bell round my neck. It's the solitude of misfortune. 

BLANCHE. 

It's better than the rush and crush of vulgar happiness. 
Do you know what you remind me of? 

PAUL. 

Of any victim of fatality, I suppose — any freak of nature 
or melancholy monster : the pig-faced lady or the pie- 
bald man ! 

BLANCHE. 

You remind me of some great wide-winged, wounded 

bird! 

PAUL. 

Do you feel like the sportsman who has brought him 
down ? Do you want to keep me as a trophy ? 



336 THE REPROBATE 

BLANCHE. 

Stuffed — in a glass case? No, I want you living; I 
want you fluttering; I want you perched on your rock, 
at least, if you must be tied to it ! 

PAUL. 

Dear Miss Amber, I'll perch anywhere, if you'll perch 
near me ! I hope you've come here to stay. 

BLANCHE. 

I'll stay as long as you hold out. But I said to you a 
while ago that I would tell you what to do in case at 
last you can't. 

PAUL. 

I can scarcely hold out now. 

BLANCHE. 

Then give in ! 

PAUL, agitated. 

Give in ? 

BLANCHE. 
If you must slip up — 

PAUL, as she hesitates. 

If I must ? 

BLANCHE. 
Do it immensely! (Then as for the first time she' becomes conscious of 

the book in his hand.) But it seems to me you have slipped up ! 



ACT SECOND 337 

PAUL, who has put the book quickly behind him. 

Immensely ! 

BLANCHE. 

Zola?. 

PAUL, producing the book. 

Zola! 

BLANCHE, compassionate 

Your Mentor failed you — and you fell ? 

PAUL. 
To where you find me ! 

BLANCHE. 

In an hour ? 

PAUL. 

In a minute ! 

BLANCHE, who has taken the book from him an instant, giving it back. 

Even to that? 

PAUL, flinging it down. 

Even to that ! 

BLANCHE, looking round her and seeing the flask, which she takes up. 

And to this ? 

PAUL. 

To that too. 

BLANCHE, with the pack of cards. 

And to this ? 

VOL. U Z 



338" THE REPROBATE 

PAUL. 

Also to that ! 

BLANCHE, with a cigar. 

And to this ? 

PAUL. 

To everything ! 

BLANCHE, with exultation. 

There's something magnificent in it ! 

PAUL, seeing Mrs. Doubled ay, who has appeared at the entrance from the ball. 

If you could only make Mamma think so 1 

Re-enter Mrs. Doubleday with several sealed and directed letters. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, sniffing the air as she comes down. 
Tobacco ? (To Blanche, as she tosses down her cigar.) Are yOU 

smoking with him ? 

BLANCHE, deciding and indicating the flask after an instant during which 
Mrs. Doubleday peremptorily rings the bell. 

Yes and drinking ! (Then indicating each of the other objects.) 

And gambling ! And reading a dreadful book. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, seeing the name as Blanche waves the book. 

Zola? 

BLANCHE. 

Zola ! 

PAUL. 

Dear mamma — it's Miss Amber's German humour. 
She has but this moment come into the room ! 



ACT SECOND 339 

BLANCHE. 

To take the place of Captain Chanter. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, looking from one of them to the other. 

Where is Captain Chanter ? 

PAUL, privately to Blanche. 

Don't tell her ! 

BLANCHE. 

Then you tell her ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, to Paul ; formidable. 

Does he neglect you ? 

PAUL, alert. 

Dear no, I shouldn't call it neglect ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Then why isn't he here ? 

Re-enter Cubit from the hall. 
CUBIT. 

Did you ring, ma'am ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Stamp these letters. 

PAUL, privately to Blanche, while Cubit takes the letters from Mrs. 

DOUBLEDAV. 

She'll repudiate him ! 



340 THE REPROBATE 

BLANCHE. 

It will serve him right. 

PAUL. 

It will serve me wrong ! (To himself.) I'll save him 1 

(Then as Mrs. Doublkday turns to him again for an answer while Cubit 
stamps letters at one of the Ubles.) I tumed the Captain OUt ! 

BLANCHE, to hereelC . 

Vou darling ! ^ 

PAUL. 

I got so bad — he fled in horror ! 

MRS. 'DOUBLED AY. 

He couldn't stand you ? 

PAUL. 

He couldn't stand me ! 

Re-enter Mr. Bonsor by the lower door on the right, while Blanche goes 
up in agitation. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, dismayed, to Mr. Bonsor. 

He couldn't stand him ! 

MR. BONSOR, dismayed. 

The Captain ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

He fled in horror ! 

PAUL, ecstatic. 

And I've had at last an hour of freedom ! 



ACT SECOND 341 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, showing Mr. Bonsor all the dreadful signs. 

An hour of freedom ! 

BLANCHE, coming round and down on the right to Paul. 
You're simply sublime ! (She goes up again.) 

PAUL, to hixnself. 

I'm saving him ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, to Cubit. 

Have you seen Captain Chanter ? 

CUBIT, with his letters stamped. 

I think he left the house, ma'am. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, excited. 

Then pursue him. (imperious, as Cubit stands.) Look for him ! 

CUBIT, at a loss. * 

Where, ma'am, shall I look ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, frantic, hurrying up. 

rU look ! 

Exit Mrs. DoUBLEDAY to the hall. 
MR. BONSOR, to Cubit, who is going. 

Whose letters are those ? 

CUBIT. 

Mrs. Doubleday's, sir. 



3A2 THE REPROBATE 

MR. BONSOR, austere. 

Don't post them. They are to announce a marriage 
which will probably not take place. 

PAUL, at the left, privately, with decbion, to Blanche, who has come down 
again on his left. 

It shall take place ! (He surreptitiously catches her right hand with 
his left and gives it a shake which she surreptitiously returns — a movement 
perceived by Mr. Bonsor.) 

MR. BONSOR, going up. 

Blanche ! 

She quickly joins him, and, after a few words, when they have gone up, he 
appears to dismiss her disapprovingly. Exit Blanche to the hall. 

PAUL, while this takes place. 
Cubit ! (Then, as Cubit, with the letters, comes to him.) PoSt them ! 

CUBIT. 

But Mr. Bonsor — 

PAUL. 

Hang Mr. Bonsor ! 

CUBIT, astounded ; then, with a gesture, smiling and taking another line. 

What'U you give me ? 

PAUL. 
For hanging Mr. Bonsor ? (Taking from his waistcoat-pocket the 
money Chanter has given him.) This ! 

CUBIT, with the money. 

Five shillings ? (Delighted.) I'll post them ! 

Exit Cubit to the hall. 



ACT SECOND 343 

MR. BONSOR, stern, coming down to Paul. 

Are you intoxicated ? 

PAUL, with an exhilaration, a familiarity, wholly new to Mr. Bonsor. 

Dear Mr. Bonsor, I never was so lucid in all the whole 
course of my existence ! 

MR. BONSOR, struck, and with his suspicions confirmed by Paul's manner 

and tone, seeing Pitt Brunt : re-enter Pitt Brunt by lower door on 

the right. 

He's simply dead drunk ! 

PITT BRUNT 

I'm perfectly aware ! I rejoin Miss Amber. 

MR. BONSOR, indicating the hall. 

She's in the morning-room. 

PITT BRUNT. 

Shall I apprise her ? 

MR. BONSOR, complacent. 

She^s perfectly aware. 

Exit Pitt Brunt to the hall. Re-enter Capt^n Chanter from the lawn. 
MR. BONSOR, eager, to Chanter. 

Do you know he's dead drunk ? 

CHANTER, coming down with his hat on — a little on the back of his head. 

Intimately ! 



344 THE REPROBATE 

MR. BONSOR. 
You couldn't stand him ? 

PAUL, at whom Chanter has looked ; privately. 

I told them you couldn't ! 

CHANTER, with assurance 

I couldn't stand him ! 

MR. BONSOR, heroical. 

Well, /can! 

CHANTER. 

But I've pulled myself together again. I can now. 

MR. BONSOR. 

It's a very dreadful sight. 

CHANTER. 

To the pure all things are pure ! 

MR. BONSOR. 

Then they're pure to w* / I'll take him myself. 

CHANTER, uneasy, protesting. 

Ah no — I've my rules to enforce ! 

MR. BONSOR. 

You told me I must rest. Vou must. 

CHANTER. 

I have rested ! 



ACT SECOND 345 

MR. BONSOR, looking at Paul a moment, then reconsidering^ deciding. 

I'll take him when he has slept it off! 

Exit Mr. BoNSOR to the hall. 
CHANTER, eager, hopeful, to Paul. 

Arc you dead drunk ? 

PAUL. 

Yes — with the sense of freedom ! 

CHANTER. 

That'll do — if you'll save me ! 

PAUL. 
I am saving you ! 

CHANTER. 

Now's your time, then — she's coming back ! 

PAUL, visibly disconcerted. 

Nina? 

CHANTER 

I saw her on the bridge — she followed me. (Seeing Mr. 
freshvillb at the window.) Here she is ! 

Exit Chanter rapidly to the library. Re-enter Mrs. Freshvillb from 
the garden. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Was that the Captain who left you ? 

PAUL. 

Yes — do you want him ? 



346 THE REPROBATE 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. vithrcsolauoo. 

No ! (After an inataoL) That's what IVc comc back to 
tell you ! 

PAUL, dvil, bat vague. 

Very good of you to come back ! 

MRS. FRESH VI LLE. with sudden utensity. 

Dudley — my feelings dragged me! I don't want any 
one in the world if I can only get you ! 

PAUL, confused. 

Me, Nina? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

My earliest friend — my most generous — and my best ! 

PAUL, embarrassed. 

My dear Nina, do I understand that you desire to make 
me your husband ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

That's the description of you that I confess I should 
find it most convenient to be able to give. 

PAUL. 

But isn't your proposal rather rashly precipitate ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Precipitate — when for years I've loved you in silence ? 
That silence, when I see you, I naturally break ! 



ACT SECOND 347 

PAUL. 

But I thought the object of your affection was our 
whimsical friend the Captain. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

So did I, till I perceived that I was fundamentally mis- 
taken. The Captain, though whimsical, is attractive; 
but he has no heart. You have a heart, Dudley. 

PAUL. 

Ah, but it doesn't make me attractive ! Nothing can ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Your situation can — your situation does. You suffer. 

PAUL. 

Oh, I can bear it ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

I can't then — when you're a captive ! 

PAUL. 
Captivity has changed me — I'm not what I was ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Never mind what you were — you'll do very well. 
You're still young — you're still charming — you're still 
free. 

PAUL. 

Free ? Why, you recognise yourself that I'm bound ! 



348 THE REPROBATE 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, suspicious, seizing his arm. 

" Bound "—to whom ? 

PAUL, alter an instant. 

No one — in the way you mean ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Then come to Paris ! 

PAUL, moved. 

To Paris? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

To the Alcazar ! 

PAULp struck, thinking. 

The Eldorado? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

The Valentino ! 

PAUL. 

The Solferino ? (After a moment.) Too late ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, resentful. 

Too late ? It isn't too late for me to chivey your photo- 
graph about ! 

PAUL, vague. 

My photograph ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, indicating her reticule. 

In this thing — wherever I go! (Abrupt.) Dudley, who 
stole it ? 



ACT SECOND 349 

PAUL, blank. 

I haven't the least idea ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Then /have! 

PAUL. 

Who in the world ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, reconsidering. 

I'll tell you when we're married ! 

PAUL. 

Dear Nina, marriage is a serious step— a step to think 
well over. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

We'll think it well over — together ! 

PAUL. 

Give me more time, Nina ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

How much more do you want ? 

PAUL, after an instant. 

Why, say till to-morrow. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Then to-morrow I'll rush to you. 

PAUL. 

Thank you — I'll rush to you. 



350 THE REPROBATE 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

At the inn ? Will they let you ? 

PAUL, after reflection, with extreme resolution. 

I won't ask them ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, irrepressible, triumphant. 

Ah, I've got you ! 

PAUL, struck, wondering. 

Have you, Nina ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, with a laugh. 

Don't look at me as if I had said I'd got the measles ! 
Look at me as if you really remembered — 

PAUL, as she hesitates. 

Remembered, Nina? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

That I'm a dear good soul. 

PAUL. 

You are^ Nina. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

And that I give you a radical change. 

PAUL. 

You do, Nina. By-bye. 



ACT SECOND 351 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 
Sy-byC (She goes up and then comes down again, while he stands lost 
in thought.) JuSt look here, Dud (Then after an instant.) Why 

arrangements ? 

PAUL, vague. 

Arrangements ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

What you call preluninaries. Fly with me without 'em ! 
The preliminaries can follow. 

PAUL, vague. 

Do you allude to our luggage ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. laughing. 

You are a daisy ! Let me pluck you now ! 

PAUL, rueful, imrcady. , 

This moment ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

You shrink — ^you desire some regular form ? 

PAUL. 

I've been taught in all these years that some regular 
form is proper. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Then we'll have one — iox youl And we'll see about it 

to-morrow. (At the window, smiling, bantering.) Propriety ! 

Exit Mrs. FRESHVILLE to the lawn.

Poor old Nina ! 

Re-enter Captain Chanter from the library. 

CHANTERf who has looked in first cantiously and speaks in a load, 
eager whisper. 

Well? 

PAUL. 

She wants me to go to Paris ! 

CHANTER 

Then why the deuce don*^ you ? 

PAUL. 

Because I don't want to ! 

CHANTER, blank, vexed. 

Don't " want " to ? 

PAUL, excited. 

Not the least bit in the world ! 

CHANTER 

Then you ougAf to want to ! 

PAUL. 

Isn't that just my difficulty — that I don't do what I 
ought ? 

CHANTER 

I'm here to make you. You're free ! 



ACT SECOND 353 

PAUL, passing his hand over his head. 

That's just whercr it is ! — I'm free ! She wants me to 
fly with her. 

CHANTER. 

Don't stand pottering, then. Fly ! 

PAUL. 
I can't fly ! 

CHANTER, trying to push him off. 

You must ! 

PAUL, disengaging himself with a flare of passion, and coming round and down. 

I won't ! 

CHANTER. 

What the devil's the matter with you ? 

PAUL. 

I don't know, Captain ! I ain't so bad---I ain't tempted ! 

CHANTER, indignant.

goes up.) Nina's a revelation ! Try her ! 

Exit Captain Chanter to the hall. 
CUBIT, to Paul. 

Letters gone, sir ! 

PAUL, with rising spirit. 

Well, I ain't, old man, ami? 

CUBIT, surprised, gratified. 

No indeed, sir ; you seem quite on the spot ! 

Exit Cubit to the hall. 

PAUL, alone, echoing, with the sense of his victory growing stronger, over- 
whelming him at last. 

" Nina's a revelation"? There are other revelations than 
Nina ! *' Try her " ? I don't wanf to try her ! I don't 
want to try anybody ! (Looking about him.) I don't want to 

do anything ! (Drops into the chair on the right of the table.) What 

is the matter with me ? I am free and I ain't bad ! 

Upon my honour (rising slowly with the force of the revelation and 

the surprise) I bclieve that, after all — it's awfully queer

ACT THIRD 

Mr Bonsor's drawing-room. Blanche Amber comes in from the 
hall, meeting Pitt Brunt, dressed in the same manner as at the 
beginning of Act First, who comes in from the garden. 

PITT BRUNT. 

Dear Miss Amber, Tm delighted to put in a few minutes 
with you — my solitude, since luncheon, has been posi- 
tively uncanny. 

BLANCHE. 

Haven't you had my uncle to comfort you ? 

PITT BRUNT. 

There's no comfort in your uncle, now that Mr. 
Doubleday has disappeared ! 

BLANCHE. 

Isn't there any in Mrs. Doubleday — exhilarated by the 
triumph of her charms ? 

PITT BRUNT. 

She buries her charms at the railway-station — waiting 
for the fugitive to alight I 



356 THE REPROBATE 

BLANCHE, disappointed. 

You don't mean to say he returns so soon ! 

PITT BRUNT. 

I don't know, dear Miss Amber, what you call " soon." 
(Looking athb watch.) A dcbauch of twenty hours ! 

BLANCHE. 

Why, he went for at least sixty ! 

PITT BRUNT, surprised. 

Did he communicate to you his programme ? 

BLANCHE. 

It was impossible — yesterday afternoon — to remain 
.gnorant of his condition. 

PITT BRUNT. 

Indeed it was 1 

BLANCHE. 

When he was missed — I understood. I know that 
when such natures fall — 

PITT BRUNT. 

They fall to the very bottom ? Tve no doubt whatever 
that he's as far down as you can go. Fortunately 
Captain Chanter has been let down after him. 

BLANCHE. 

By a rope round the waist — to pull him out ? I per- 
fectly know for what purpose he followed Mr. Paul to 
London. 



ACT THIRD 357 

PITT BRUNT. 

The engagement he had conscientiously taken left him 
no alternative, and he surmounted the repugnance he 
naturally felt When he brings the culprit back we 
shall clear up the mystery of where the money came 
from — the money for Doubleday's fare. 

BLANCHE. 

By the train to town ? It was only two shillings. 

PITT BRUNT. 

He had no such amount in his possession. We are 
reluctantly driven to the belief that he stole the two 
shillings. 

BLANCHE, indignant. 

Your beliefs a false belief ! He didn't I 

PITT BRUNT. 

To say nothing of the money for the other excesses that 
were his objective. You admitted just now that such 
natures sink to the bottom. Well, the bottom is theft ! 

BLANCHE. 

Then he stopped half-way. He borrowed the money. 

PITT BRUNT. 

From whom, pray — since the very servants have been 
examined ? (Then as she remains silent.) Will you accompany 
me on the river ? I put in an hour each day, and my 
hour has come round. 



358 THE REPROBATE 

BLANCHE. 
Your hour may have come round, Mr. Brunt, but your 
humble servant hasn't. You don't take the right way to 
make her ! 

PITT BRUNT. 

I'll take it in the boat. (Confident, engaging.) You See if I 
don't ! 

BLANCHE, impatient. 

Ah, your boat's not my boat, and it's impossible for me 
to embark with you ! 

PITT BRUNT, more pressing. 

I want you to embark, you know, on the river of life ; 
to float with me down the crystal stream — 

BLANCHE. 

That flows into the Smutt at Blackport? I don't find 
that a tempting voyage ! 

PITT BRUNT, as Mr. Bonsor appears. 

Only give me a chance to point you out the beauties ! 

Enter Mr. Bonsor from the hall. 
MR. BONSOR, encouraging. 

Ah, you're pointing out to Miss Amber the beauties ? 

PITT BRUNT. 

Even as you have pointed them out to me I 



ACT THIRD 359 

BLANCHE, at the door of the library ; with a curtsey. 

I must leave you to discuss them together ! 

Exit Blanche Amber. 
PITT BRUNT. 

She won't come out with me in the boat. 

MR. BONSOR. 

The best place to command her attention, as I instructed 
you. 

PITT BRUNT. 

I seek in vain, Mr. Bonsor, to command her attention 
or to carry out your instructions. 

MR. BONSOR. 

They seem indeed, in the light of the present crisis, to 

have been singularly futile ! (Then seeing Cubit with a telegram.) 

I tremble at every telegram ! 

Enter Cubit from the hall. 
CUBIT, as Mr. Bonsor takes the telegram from his tray. 

The ninth, sir ! 

MR. BONSOR, opening the telegram. 

The Captain reports to us from hour to hour his alter- 
nations of confidence and despair.

I hope this time it's confidence.

MR. BONSOR. 
It may come to that ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, bjured. 

You might take a little less interest in Miss Amber's 
marriage — ! 

MR. BONSOR. 

And a little more interest in yours? I consider that 
you should make a condition. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, vague. 

For the retention of my hand ? 

MR. BONSOR, 

The success of the Captain's pursuit. He must bring 
Paul back. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

But if Paul has sunk lower than any sounding? 

MR. BONSOR. 

The Captain requires the equipment of a diver ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. decided. 

We'll have no more diving : he must come back without 
him ! Paul will have dropped to his natural level. 

MR. BONSOR. 

You allude to the supposed companion of his orgy? 
That she is his companion is after all but an hypothesis. 



362 THE REPROBATE 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

An hypothesis for which the evidence is crushing. It 
was the ground for the Captain's action — an action 
admirably prompt. 

MR. BONSOR. 

Oh yes, when the horse was stolen ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

If the horse is stolen, there are consolations. For 
really, to receive Paul — 

MR. BONSOR, as she felters. 

From the arms of such a creature ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Would cost me more than I can say ! 

MR. BONSOR. 

I would protect you by receiving him first — I would 
pump him dry. 

MRS DOUBLEDAY. 

I should feel as if he would never be dry ! 

MR. BONSOR. 

We should have doubtless more than ever, in our 
intercourse with him, to make use of the moral 
mackintosh. 

MRS. DOUDLEDAY. 

I impressed upon Captain Chanter from the first the 
necessity of such a garment. 



ACT THIRD 363 

MR. BONSOR. 
However, since he has muffed his catch — 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, with asperity. 

Why the dickens doesn't he come back? (Up at the long 
window.) I'll wire that question ! 

Exit Mrs. DoUBLEDAY. 

MR. BONSOR, alone, surprised. 
Not, I hope, in those words ! (Then as he sees Blanche : re-enter 
Blanche Amber from the library.) Mr. Brunt's gOUe withoUt yOU? 

BLANCHE. 

No, dear uncle ; he's in there. 

MR. BONSOR. 

And what's he doing ? 

BLANCHE. 

When I left him he was making a speech. 

MR. BONSOR, struck ; at the door of the library. 

On what subject ? 

BLANCHE. 

Try to make out ! 

MR. BONSOR, as he listens, with his eyes on Blanche and an admonitory 
motion. 

Hear, hear ! 

Exit rapidly Mr. Bonsor. 



364 THE REPROBATE 

BLANCHE, joyous, as she sees Paul. 

Ah, what a blessed change ! 

Enter Paul Doubleday from the hall ; with a complete ttansfonnatioa of 
appearance, expression, demeanour. He is bright, confident, assured, and 
dressed in the height of the fashion ; with flowers in his buttonhole, his 
moustache bravely curled, his high hat, of a striking diape, gallantly worn. 
He carries in his hand a magnificent bouquet, and is followed by Cubit, 
who bears an armful of parcels. 

PAUL, in high spirits. 

Dispose them on the table, Cubit, and treat them with 
respect — they're the spoils of a great campaign ! 

CUBIT. 

And what shall I give the cabman ? 

PAUL. 

Give him my blessing ! 

CUBIT. 

Tm afraid he won't go for that, sir. 

PAUL. 

If he won't go he can stay ! 

CUBIT, scandalised. 

At half-a-crown an hour ? 

PAUL. 

J stayed for less, Cubit — all those years. 

CUBIT, deprecating. 

Oh you, Mr. Paul — ! 



ACT THIRD 365 

PAUL. 
Well, I wasn't such a fool as we thought ! 

BLANCHE, who has produced her portemonnaie ; giving Cubit a coin. 

Dismiss the cab. 

CUBIT, with the money. 

And bring back the change ? 

BLANCHE. 

Keep the change. 

CUBIT, to himself. 

Seven-and-six ! 

Exit Cubit to the hall. 
PAUL, who has dashed at Blanche to kiss her hand. 

Has my absence excited remark ? 

BLANCHE. 

It has been the only subject of our conversation. 

PAUL. 

Have you mentioned, in the course of that conversation, 
the motive of my little break ? 

BLANCHE, smiling. 

How can I have mentioned it when I haven't known it ? 

PAUL, surprised. 

Didn't I make it clear — ? 



366 THE REPROBATE 

BLANCHE. 
When I rejoined you in the garden — after your fall ? 

PAUL, oblivious. 

My fall? 

BLANCHE 

Why, to the old wild life. 

PAUL, prompt, perfUnctory. 

Oh yes, the old wild life ! 

BLANCHE. 

I don't strike a man when he's down. 

PAUL. 
Certainly, I forgot I'm down ! (Offering his bouquet ; smiling.) 

And I gathered on my way down this handful of flowers. 

BLANCHE, with the bouquet. 

Flowers as wild as yourself? — flowers of folly, flowers 
of passion ? (inhaling their odour.) They're swect — but 
ought I to say so ? 

PAUL. 

Why not ? — I got them in Baker Street. (Then as Blanche 
looks disconcerted.) A jolly good shop — with an awfully 
pretty girl. 

BLANCHE, more reassured ; after an instant. 

Perhaps you had better not tell me about people of 
that sort. I don't wish to draw you out. 



ACT THIRD 367 

PAUL. 
I see. (Then after an instant.) But pcrhaps you think Tm 
worse than I am ! 

BLANCHE. 

Not worse than you were when you let everything go. 

PAUL. 

When — ^and where — did I let anything go ? 

BLANCHE. 

Why, yesterday afternoon, in the garden, as I say, when 
you finally told me you must get off by yourself. 

PAUL. 

For the first time for such an age ? 

BLANCHE. 

You declared you must go up to town. 

PAUL. 

Precisely, for a little change. 

. BLANCHE. 

You disguised your necessity under a singular expression. 

PAUL. 

I said I must take a look round ? — Well, I took a look. 

BLANCHE, prompt. 

Oh, you needn't tell me what you've seen ! 



368 THE REPROBATE 

PAUL, bringing a parcel from the table. 

I saw some bonbons in Bond Street — ^and brought you 
a btJ'x. 

BLANCHE, with the box. 

Was there a pretty girl in that shop too ? 

PAUL, laughing. 
Oh yes, two or three ! (Then showing a small parcel.) I got 

something else, you see — as a present to Mamma. 

BLANCHE. 

Well, youVe certainly made the money fly ! 

PAUL. 

All over the place ! Why shouldn't I — hang it ! — if I 
happen to feel flush ? 

BLANCHE, struck. 

Isn't that the old wild tone ? 

PAUL. 

I daresay it is, the devil take it ! 

BLANCHE, alert. 

There it is again ! 

PAUL. 

It seems as if it had come to stay, doesn't it ? 

BLANCHE. 

We mustn't let it stay any longer than it positively must. 
Remember that Tm fighting on your side. 



ACT THIRD 369 

PAUL, laughing. 

Dear Miss Amber, you're even more adorable, upon my 
word, than when you first took service under my flag ! 

BLANCHE. 

You mustn't say such things to me till youVe recovered. 

PAUL. 

That IVe recovered is precisely what's the matter with 
me ! 

BLANCHE, vague. 

Do you mean from the effects of yesterday ? 

PAUL. 

I mean from the effects of these ten years. (Reckless.) 
My dear girl, confound it, you know, I'm all right ! 

BLANCHE, disappointed. 

Already ? 

PAUL. 

Surely it has taken long enough. 

BLANCHE. 

Not long enough for me. (After an instant.) I don't care 
for saints ! There's one at me already. 

PAUL. 

The member for Blackport ? (Prompt.) Oh, I'm not so 
good as he 1 

BLANCHE. 

If you were you*d be too awful. 4 

VOL. 11 2 B 



370 THE REPROBATE 

PAUL. 
But I'm as good as — ^as good as — 

BLANCHE, challenging, while he considers 

As good as who ? 

PAUL. 

Well, as good as most men ! 

BLANCHE, disgusted. 

That's far too good 1 

PAUL, trying again. 

Then Fm as good as Captain Chanter. 

BLANCHE. 

I don't believe it! Captain Chanter's far too good. 

(Then after an instant.) If yOU'rC SO trcmcndoUSly virtUOUS, 

and you happen to feel flush, please repay me — 

PAUL. 

The money you so kindly lent me ? It was a return- 
ticket. I could neither have started nor come back 
without the pecuniary assistance you were so good as to 
render my distress; but I'm sorry to say that distress 
remains very much what it was. 

BLANCHE. 

Then how can you have felt flush ? 



ACT THIRD 371 

PAUL. 

By the purchase of hats and coats and trousers. Ready 
made — I told them to put them down. 

BLANCHE, vague. 

Down to me ? 

PAUL. 
Down to Mamma. (indicating the other objects.) Put doWH 

everythmg. 

BLANCHE, exultant. 

Then youVe gloriously in debt ! And your mother 
won't pay. 

PAUL, decided. 

Shell /uive to ! 

BLANCHE, decided. 

She shan't I 

PAUL, blank. 

Then who will ? 

BLANCHE, after an instant. 

What if /should? 

PAUL, gazing at her with surprise and emotion, then bounding to her, seizbg 
her hand, and raising it again to his lips. 

Angel ! 

Re-enter Mrs. Doublsday from the garden. 
MRS. DOUBLEDAY, arrested, amazed. 

Paul! 



372 THE REPROBATE 

PAUL, with oodistnrbed self-possesnon and good-humoar. 

I was saluting Miss Amber in the joy of my return. 
Permit me, under the influence of the same emotion, to 
extend to you^ dear Manuxia (approaching her with open annsx an 
embrace more comprehensive. 

Re-enter Mr. Bonsor fixmi the library. 

MR. BONSOR, arrested, amazed, while Mrs. Doublsday bewilderedly 
submits. 

Mrs. Doubleday ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, confounded, but bridling and indicating Blanche. 

I found him kissing her ! 

MR. BONSOR, aghast, as Pitt Brunt reappears. 

Her? 

Re-enter Pitt Brunt from the library. 
PITT BRUNT, echoing, indignant. 

Her? 

BLANCHE, exalted, audacious, passmg in front of Pitt Brunt on her 
way up left. 

Her whatl Her finger-tips ! 

PAUL, to Pitt Brunt, laughing. 

Aren't even the finger-tips more than ever you've got 
at? — How d*ye do, Mr. Bonsor? Noticed my little 
break ? — ^remarked my lucid interval ? (Then as the others 

exchange expressions of stupefaction.) Deplored it, then, bewailed 

it, felt it in the seat of sensibility ? Very charming of 
you all 1 



ACT THIRD 373 

MR. BONSOR. 
If you designate by those extraordinary terms your un- 
accountable absence, I have only to observe that, though 
it has been briefer than we apprehended, we've been 
amply occupied in considering the questions with which 
we should find ourselves confronted on its coming to an 
end. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

If it should come to an end ! 

PAUL, surprised, amtised. 

If it should? Why, what did you think I was in for? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

We didn't permit ourselves to name it ! 

[MR. BONSOR. 

You mean not to each other. 

PITT BRUNT. 

Only to hint it to a third person. 

BLANCHE, who has come down smiling, on the right. 

And yet draw the line at a fourth ! 

MR. BONSOR. 
That line, Blanche, is not yet effaced. 

PAUL, to Mrs. DOUBLEDAY. 

Did you miss the usual forms of separation ? You see 

I had to pop off. (Then* as they are again visibly startled.) To 



374 THE REPROBATE 

catch the 4.40 — ^the particular train I wanted! I re- 
quired those hours in town, don't you know? — ^there 
were things I had imperatively to do. But I put on a 
spurt — I managed to rush them through ! 

MR. BONSOR. 

You speak as if they had been odious necessities ! 

PAUL. 

There's no doubt, Mr. Bonsor, they were necessities, 
and distinctly urgent ones ; but, urgent as they were, it 
would indeed be wide of the mark to call them in the 
least odious. In fact the whole thing was a treat ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Paul! 

MR. BONSOR. 

Blanche! Please leave the room. (To Pitt Brunt.) He 
has really reached a point — 

PITT BRUNT. 
That embarrasses even me. (Opening the lower door on the right 

for Blanche.) Your retreat. 

PAUL, opening for her with a laugh the door of the library. 

Spare my blushes ! 

BLANCHE, between the doors a moment, then at Paul's, giving him a brush 
in the face with her bouquet. 

Reprobate I 

Exit Blanche Amber to the library. 



ACT THIRD 375 

PAUL. 
You see it was the first time for years, and there wasn't 
a single moment of it that hadn't its appreciable 

quality ! (Then while Mrs. 'Doubled ay and Mr. Bonsor indulge in mani- 
festations of increasing dismay.) Whatever delights the future 
may hold for me, I feel I never shall forget the rapture 
of those hours. Everything, in such a case, conspires 
to intensify the bliss : it's the sort of thing that, as I 
may say, don't you know ? one makes for ever one's own ! 

MR. BONSOR. 

Mrs. Doubleday, shall I face it alone? 

PITT BRUNT, springing to the lower door on the right, which he holds 
open for her. 

While you step in here ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

I think I shall suffer less if you step in there. (To Mr. 
Bonsor.) Tell him to leave us. 

PITT BRUNT, disconcerted. 

Then I'll mingle my innocence with Miss Amber's. 

PAUL, checking him with a gesture as he crosses to the library. 

My dear fellow, I wish to mingle mine 1 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

After this extraordinary exhibition of your having none ? 



376 THE REPROBATE 

PAUL, arrested, chagrined. 

Ah yes — for her! (To Pitt Brunt.) What I mean is, don't 
you know ? that I aspire to her myself. 

PITT BRUNT, to Mr. Bonsor. 

I believe he's still drunk ! 

PAUL, at the lower door on the right, which he holds open for Pitt Brunt. 

In vino Veritas — when I'm drunk I'm pressing ! 

PITT BRUNT, crossing at last to the door, where he stands again an 
instant with his eyes on Paul. 

Reprobate I 

Exit Pitt Brunt. 
PAUL. 

And where, all this while, is the dear old Captain ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, with high significance. 

That's what I should like particularly to know ! 

MR. BONSOR. 

He has not returned from London. 

PAUL, surprised. 

What's he doing in London ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

I wish you would find out ! 

MR. BONSOR. 

He went up to track you. 



ACT THIRD 377 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

But he has given you up. 

MR. BONSOR. 

Prematurely, we can't but think. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

He reports that youVe disappeared. 

MR. BONSOR. 

For ever — ^with a female. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

The same female. 

PAUL. 

The old female — Nina ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, alert. 

Is she old, Dudley ? 

PAUL. 

Dear me, yes — about your age. And she's here. 

MR. BONSOR. 

You brought her back ? 

PAUL. 

I didn't take her ! 

MR. BONSOR. 

And she didn't take you ? 



378 THE REPROBATE 

PAUL, with a gesture of repodiatuMi ; almost wounded. 

How could she ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, with deepening uneasiness. 

Then what's she here for ? 

PAUL, bethinldng himself. 

Perhaps after all she has gone. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Perhaps after all she hasn't ! You'll be so good as to 
find out 

MR BONSOR, astonished. 

You wish to throw them together ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

I wish to keep them apart ! 

PAUL, vague. 

Of whom, Mamma, do you speak ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

I speak of Captain Chanter ! 

PAUL, after an instant ; diplomatic 

There's plenty of time. — He reports that I've vanished? 

MR. BONSOR. 

He wires that you're practically extinct. 



ACT THIRD 379 

PAUL. 

Does he take me for a species — or for a volcano ? In 
the latter case I'm in lively eruption ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, suspicious. 

Why hasn't he mentioned the position of the second 
crater ? 

PAUL. 

The lady to whom we just alluded ? — ^The second crater's 

temporarily quiet. (At the table on which he caused his parcels to be 

deposited.) Such a pity the Captain's away — I've brought 
him a charming present : a couple of French novels — 
the last things out. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

And pray where have you picked up such insidious 
productions ? 

PAUL. 

In Leicester Square — such a funny little shop. 

MR. BONSOR. 

The contents of which you also appropriated — 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, as he hesitates. 

When the proprietor didn't happen to be looking ! 

PAUL, staring ; then laughing. 
You mean I bagged them ? (With two other mementoes from the 

table.) Yes, and I prigged something for each oiyou / 



38o THE REPROBATE 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, with her present, opening a small case. 

A massive bracelet ? 

MR. BONSOR, domg the same. 

And an expensive pin ? 

PAUL. 

So glad you like them ! I had them booked. 

MR. BONSOR. 

And how will you pay for them ? 

- PAUL. 
Why, as one always pays— out of income. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, triumphant. 

You haven't got any income ! 

PAUU 
I shall have a very good one when we settle. 

MR BONSOR. 

That will be ten years hence. We don't settle till 
you're forty. 

PAUL. 

My dear Mr. Bonsor, I am forty. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Since when ? You were thirty last week. 



ACT THIRD 381 

PAUL. 
So I was. But IVe grown. 

MR. BONSOR. 

Ten years — in a week ? 

PAUL. 

Ten years in an hour ! I'm of age. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, aghast 

To cease to be looked after ? 

PAUL. 

To begin to look after you, I am beginning — I have 
begun. So you'll pay me up. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

The wages of sin ? 

PAUL. 

I really think the Only sin is the sin of impertinence ! 
Don't you so much as thank me for the reward of yours ? 

MR. BONSOR 

Your mother will hardly go through such a form for an 
ornament she is incapable of retaining. She will take 
it back — 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, who has slipped the bracelet over her arm, where 

she has complacently regarded it ; after a little renunciatory wriggle 

at the clasp. 

As soon as I succeed in removing it. And Mr. Bonsor 
will only keep his pin — 



382 THE REPROBATE 

PAUL. 
To Stick into me when he*s vicious ? I warn him that 

IVe ceased to be a pin-cushion! (Withanmustrated"society-

PAUL. 
Don't do that: it's too awfully like ! (Taking from his pocket 

asmaUpaper.) That's the figure of what I've spent 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, with the paper, in dismay, to Mr. Bonsor. I 

Seventy pounds ! I 

PAUL. 

Nine and sevenpence. I'll trouble you for a cheque.

Never ! 

Exit Mr. BoNSOR. Enter Captain Chanter from the hall. 
PAUL. 

Hang it then, will you ? 

CHANTER, aghast. 

You're not off with her, as I instructed you ? 

PAUL. 

I'm no more off than she is. I'm to call on her. 

CHANTER, frantic. 

Then by all that's desperate, call 1 

PAUL. 

There's no hurry, my dear fellow. Nina won't go ! 

CHANTER. 

She'll go if you*// go. You told me so yourself! 

PAUL. 

Yes, but I won't — that's what I've an appointment to 

make her understand. (Then on a wild motion of despair of 

Chanter's.) If you thought we Aad bolted, why did you 
give chase ? 

CHANTER. 

To speed you on your way — to smother your remorse. 
You promised to save me, and I've been living in the 
blind confidence that I was saved I 



384 THE REPROBATE 

PAUL. 
You shall be if you keep your head — if you'll do exactly 
what I tell you. In the first place, you must assist me 
with Miss Amber. You must not let her find out that 
I ain't what I thought 

CHANTER. 

Nor what I thought, either ! I thought I could trust 
you! 

PAUL. 

You thought I had every vice. So did I, till I was put 
to the test. You put me to it yourself — you proved me 
utterly wanting. But it's the fond belief that I'm a 
splendid Satan that's the singular source of her interest. 

CHANTER. 

That interest is quenched, then, from the moment you 
moon about here. The way to impress her is obviously 
to do something Satanic 

PAUL. 

A good way to begin, then, will be to keep a devil of an 
eye on you. You're indispensable to my plan. 

CHANTER. 

I operate as a diversion to Mrs. Doubleday ! 

PAUL. 

If you'll direct her activity into a different channel — 



ACT THIRD 385 

CHANTER. 

You'll also find a different one for Nina's? What 
channel is there — 

PAUL. 

But the one from Dover to Calais? VWfindone^ if I 
have to dig it ! Leave me to do so. 

CHANTER, uneasy. 

With Nina all over the place ?

Chanter still stands reluctant ; authoritative.) Go tO yOUr rOOm J

by the lower door on the right.) Have you Come to tell me you 
will write the cheque ? 

MR. BONSOR. 

For half the amount — on a condition. That of your 
withdrawing your opposition — 

PAUL. 

To the Idol of the North as an active rival ? (Thinking, 
amused.) For thirty-fivc pounds ? 

MR. BONSOR. 

Four and ninepence ha'penny. Permit him regular

BLANCHE, with her bouquet. 

I must delay no longer to put my flowers into water. 

MR. BONSOR. 

I beg you to come back then as soon as you've supplied 
them with a sustenance of which I decline to regard 
them as deserving. The member for Blackport —

What on earth does he want now ? 

MR. BONSOR. 

What youVe never yet frankly given him — the chance 
to catch your eye. 

BLANCHE. 

Dear uncle, I'm not the Speaker ! 

MR. BONSOR. 

He'll make you feel like the House itself. And when 
the House divides —

It wil! be impossible henceforth to calculate with any 
exactness. Hitherto weVe done it to a second. 

PITT BRUNT, aggrieved. 

You should really have taken him in hand ! 

MR. BONSOR. 

The way to begin was by taking that woman. 

PITT BRUNT, after a moment. 

That may possibly be the way to end ! 

MR. BONSOR, struck. 

It might be — all the more that she's somewhere about. 
(After an instant.) I suppose her attractions are pronounced. 

PITT BRUNT, prompt. 

Very easily, with a little practice ! 

MR. BONSOR, surprised. 

Then youVe seen her? 

PITT BRUNT, on his guard. 

Not to know it was she ! But if she's somewhere about, 
her confederate must also be.

I've come to put in mine — I'm tired of messing about 

PITT BRUNT. 

I heard just now you were messing —

Oh no, he doesn't mention it — but the whole thing's

Then how does the woman take it ? 

PITT BRUNT, deprecating. 

She's scarcely a woman — ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, impatient. 

I know — she's a monster ! What does she make of it ? 

PITT BRUNT. 

You're severe ! But she doesn't make quite so much of 
it as you might expect. She takes it rather easy. In 
fact you might suppose she almost likes it ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, astounded. 

Likes his goings on with me ? 

PITT BRUNT. 

Then they've been as bad as we all suppose ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

They've been beyond everything that ever was ! (With 
renewed stupefaction.) She Hkes his being engaged to another 
woman ? 

PITT BRUNT, surprised. 

Do you mean to say he's literally engaged? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

As much as a man ever was in the world. Engaged up 
to his eyes— engaged down to his boots !

PITT BRUNT. 
Happily I don't think she knows that ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Then I shall have the pleasure of telling her !

I daresay it will produce some effect. She doesn't mind 
anything except that 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Except marriage — or the next thing to it? And she 
calls herself a respectable woman ? 

PITT BRUNT, wincing ; after an instant. 

I'm bound to say she's very hard to shock, 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Put it Stronger. She's a monster of what-do-you-call-it ! 

PITT BRUNT, at a loss. 

Do you call it paradox ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

I call it immorality ! But wasn't I jolly right to come ! 

PITT BRUNT. 

Do you argue that he'll see you ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Not if he can help it ! But I argue that I'm perfectly 
visible. Where do you suppose he is ?

PITT BRUNT, looking at his watch ; melancholy. 

I'm afraid he's somewhere with her, 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Don't take it harder than / do I (After an instant.) Could 
you bring us together ? 

PITT BRUNT, vague. 

You and him ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Me and her. 

PITT BRUNT, disconcerted. 

Dear no — not that ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Well, you needn't scratch my eyes out ! (Holding up several 
of Chanter's letters.) It wiU do quite as Well to hand her 
these. His letters — nine of 'em — breathing every vow. 

PITT BRUNT, with the letters; alert. 

Vows of passion — vows of marriage ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Vows of everything on earth — and every vow a lie. 
Poke 'em in her face. 

PITT BRUNT, intensely eager. 

I'll poke 'em ! But how can I ever thank you ? 



39a THE REPROBATE 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Thank me for nothing ! I didn't do it for you I (Then as 

Cubit reappears : re-enter Cubit from the hall.) That Way ? 
PITT BRUNT, surprised. 

You're going off? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Tm going on. (Up at the door to the hall.) Work her up ! 

Exeunt Mrs. Freshvillb and Cubit to the hall. 
PITT BRUNT, as Blanche reappears. 

I'll work her up ! 

Re-enter Blanche Amber by the lower door on the right 
BLANCHE. 

My uncle has just told me you wish to catch my eye. 

PITT BRUNT. 

In order to direct it, Miss Amber, to unprecedented 
documents. 

BLANCHE, smiling. 

Parliamentary papers ? 

PITT BRUNT. 
Not exactly Blue Books ! (Giving her Mrs. Freshville's letters.) 

I place them in your hands. 

BLANCHE, with the letters, vague. 

You mean I'm to look them through? But they're 

letters they're private. (Then after hastily glancing at a word here 

and there.) They're all about love ! 



ACT THIRD 393 

PITT BRUNT. 
The/re all about marriage — you'll easily see ! 

BLANCHE. 

I don't want to see — especially if they're yours ? 

PITT BRUNT. 

How can you think they're mine when you know my 
hand ? 

BLANCHE, with a look at the letters again. 

Yes — ^it's a better hand than yours ! (Then suddenly tossing 
them down.) But I ncvcr read such stuff ! 

PITT BRUNT. 

They may well bring the blush. to your cheek, but I 
regret to be obliged to deepen it! — You haven't seen 
that writing? 

BLANCHE, with a letter that is out of its envelope, trying ineffectually to 
remember, then suddenly catching sight of something. 

Oh yes, I recall a name ! 

PITT BRUNT, exultant. 

May I inquire what name ? 

BLANCHE. 

The name that was on his photograph. 

PITT BRUNT, struck. 

He has given you his photograph ? 



394 THE REPROBATE 

BLANCHE. 
Oh yes. That is he hasn't ! 

PITT BRUNT. 

But you recognbe the writer ? 



Mr. Paul? 
Mr. Paul ! 
" Dudley " ! 
Dudley? 



BLANCHE, troubled, uncertain. 

PITT BRUNT, triumphant. 

BLANCHE, with emotion, thinking. 

PITT BRUNT, vague. 



BLANCHE, after another glance at the open letters. 

It's the pet name. " To his Nina " ! 

PITT BRUNT, at the door of the library; impressive. 

Say, Madam, to his miserable victim ! 

Exit Pitt Brunt. 
BLANCHE, alone, agitated. 

He makes victims — and makes them miserable ? (Hastily 

gathering the letters together.) . Who should knOW it better 

than I? — But what has Mr. Brunt to do with these 
things — how did he ever get them ? He gave them to 
me as a warning ? (After an instant.) Miserable as I am, I 
reject the warning ! I'll give them back to the writer ! 

(Then as she sees Paul and instinctively puts the letters behind her.) Oh, 

Mr. Paul, you're just the man — ! 



ACT THIRD 395 

Re-enter Paul Doubleday from the hall, in an elaborate change of costume. 
PAUL, anxious, flurried. 

YouVe just the woman, Miss Amber, but I^m trying to 
track the Captain. IVe something special to say to him. 

Re-enter Captain Chanter from the hall. 
CHANTER, to Paul. 

IVe just seen Cubit — he tells me you want me. 

BLANCHE, at the lower door on the right, to Paul, smiling. 

Then you don't want me I 

Exit Blanche Amber with the letters. 
PAUL, breathless. 

Mamma knows all — she has your letters ! 

CHANTER, appalled. 

Nina has been here ? 

PAUL. 

She is here — in my retreat. 

CHANTER, astonished. 

YouVe got one ? 

PAUL. 

The Chinese room — IVe taken it. She arrived — fear- 
fully out of patience — as I was on the very point of 
going to her, and I thought it best to have her right in. 
But she had already passed in the letters. She proclaims 
her vengeance on you as successfully accomplished, and 



396 THE REPROBATE 

I left her there gloating over it to come and warn you. 
The faf s on the fire — but I told her I can't oblige her. 

CHANTER, rueful, resentftil. 

You can't oblige anybody ! So what the mischief is she 

waiting for ? 

PAUL. 

For her photograph — I mean for mine. You broke 
your promise to carry it to her, and she declines to leave 
the house without it 

CHANTER. 

How could I carry it to her when I couldn't find it ? 

PAUL, looking blankly about. 

I'm in exactly the same predicament ! 

CHANTER, helpless, hopeless. 

So she's here for the rest of our lives ? 

PAUL, as Mrs. Doubleday reappears. 

I'm terribly afraid not ! 

Re-enter Mrs. Doubleday from the garden. Instantly astonished by the 
presence of Chanter, she hurries down toward him ; then, between the two 
men,'stopping short, looks with sudden wonderment and suspicion from one 
of them to the other. 

CHANTER, embarrassed, confused, but trying to meet her. 

Dearest friend ! 



MRS. DOUBLEDAY, retaining, with resentment and severity, possession 
of the hand he tries to kiss. 

Your dearest friend has come to get you ! (Then as Chanter 



ACT THIRD 397 

exchanges with Paul a look of confirmed dismay.) YoU grOSSly dCSCrt 

your dearest friend ! 

CHANTER, collapsing, pleading. 

I know that my conduct has been dreadful — ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 
I must clear it up with you. (indicating the garden.) I'vC 

been perched there on the lookout. 

PAUL. 

His arrival happened to escape your notice — it has just 
taken place. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Long enough ago for me to remark that his first impulse 
has not been the impulse to fly to me. 

PAUL. 

He was in the very act of spreading his wings ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

It has come home to me since your own return that he 

spread them very wide in town. (Then to Chanter, while he 
exchanges with Paul another woeful regard.) YoU SCC the Condition 

in which your pupil has reappeared? Your responsi- 
bilities sit very light ! 

PAUL. 

He has just been explaining to me that he has every 
intention to meet them. 



398 THE REPROBATE 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

They have increased tremendously this morning, and he 
shall presently hear from me on the subject. In the 
meantime he'll go to my room and ask my maid for a 
precious packet, conspicuous on the mantel-piece, sealed 
with large red seals and containing papers of grave 

importance. (To Chanter, who stands bewildered while Paul goes up 

in agitation.) You'll take them straight to my boudoir, and 
we'll go through them together. (With high resolution.) We'll 
have it right over 1 

CHANTER, Ungering, paralysed. 

I see what you mean ! 

PAUL, coming down again, with irrepressible authority. 

Then march ! 

Exit Chanter, startled, with a rush of desperation, to the hall. 
MR&amp; DOUBLEDAY, who has massively seated herself. 

What did you remark to him ? 

PAUL, familiar, gay. 

I remarked, my dear lady, that there's no resisting you ; 
and there evidently isn't, unless a fellow's like me. But, 
you know, I'm adamant, whereas the Captain's all fiddle- 
strings and moonbeams. (Then as she stares, astounded at his new 

tone.) There's one thing, however, you know — you 
mustn't, as I may say, presume^ you mustn't stake every- 
thing, on the force — or, as you would perhaps yourself 
prefer to call it, the charm — of your certainly remarkable 
personality. You'll tell me it has seen you through often 



ACT THIRD 399 

enough to show you how far you can go; and I fully 
recognise that time has given it those comfortable curves, 
those generous gradients over which the railroad of social 
intercourse may be laid at an expense not incompatible 
with the hope that it will pay. You can go a certain 
length, Mamma, you can achieve certain runs — but you 
can't make the time you did ! A road may be well kept 
up, but if you go in for heavy traffic you must lay your 
iccount with a smash. Don't therefore, as I say, don't 
magnify small accidents. Don't cry out about a collision 
when there has only been a casual bump! (Laughing, 
flattering.) Your casual bumps, Mamma, certainly oughtn't 
to bruise ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, rising in stupefaction. 

You take advantage, sir, of the absence of the few pro- 
tectors I possess — ! 

PAUL, good-humoured, imperturbable. 

Only to enjoin upon you not to make too much of such 
things. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, after an instant. 

Of what things, I beg to know, are you indecent enough 
to speak ? 

PAUL. 

Why, for instance, of those trashy papers. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Pray, do you take into account their authorship ? 



400 THE REPROBATE 

PAUL. 
It's just their authorship that makes them mere hyper- 
bole! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, after another moment. 

Will you be so good as to tell me what you're talking 
about ? 

PAUL, surprised. 

The letters you sent the Captain for. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

What's your reason for calling them letters ? 

PAUL, checked, embarrassed. 

I don't insist on the name. Outbursts of momentary 
ardour. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, very alert. 

Then / insist on the name! — What abyss have you 
unguardedly opened ? 

PAUL, after an instant. 

What are the papers you are to go over with the Captain ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Instructions from the late Mr. Doubleday — drawn up in 
view of the contingency which has now presented itself. 

PAUL. 

That of your chucking up his son ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

That of your " chucking up " his widow ! 



ACT THIRD 401 

PAUL, amused. 

Something seems to tell me the instructions are 
voluminous ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

I've every confidence. But it's a mystery I've always 
respected. The large red seals are intact. 

PAUL. 

And you propose to delegate to the Captain the office 
of breaking them ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

After first assuring myself that he is really worthy of it. 

(Then after an instant, abrupt, distressfully appealing, with a complete change 

oftonc and manner.) Paul — ts he really worthy ? 

PAUL, laughing. 

Doesn't it strike you I'm an extraordinary person to ask ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

You're the person who knows most about such things. 

PAUL. 

Let me inquire in turn what things you're talking about. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

The horrible things men do. You've betrayed him — 
and he has betrayed himself. 

PAUL. 

I've never betrayed anybody, and I can promise you I 
never will ! We'll respect the mystery of the late Mr. 

VOL. II 2D 



402 THE REPROBATE 

Doubleday's instructions — we'll keep our hands from 
the large red seals. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY.- 

You practically proclaim, then, that the Captain's are 

impure ? (With another outburst of entreaty.) Paul, who tS the 

woman to whom he has been writing ? (Then as Paul throws 

up his arms in embarrassed repudiation.) 1*11 draW yOU a chcqUC 

for half the amount of your bills. 

PAUL. 

Thirty-five pounds ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

Four and ninepence ha'penny — if you'll tell me the truth. 

PAUL, thinking. 

The real truth ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, ardent. 

The whole truth ! 

PAUL, after another moment. 

Not for the money ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, indignant, flouncing off. 

I'll get it from him ! 

Exit Mrs. DOUBLEDAY to the hall. 

PAUL, alone, disconcerted. 
She'll break with him ! (Then, alarmed, as Mr. Bonsor reappears : 
re-enter Mr. Bonsor by the lower door on the right.) Mr. BonSOr, wUl 

she break with him ? 



ACT THIRD 403 

MR. BONSOR. 

My ungovernable niece ? I^m sorry to have to recognise 
that she has already practically done so. She has 
levelled against my young friend an accusation under 
the effect of which I have fairly staggered from her 
presence — an accusation of conduct — 

PAUL, as he can't bring it out. 

Unparliamentary ? What has he done ? 

MR. BONSOR. 
I am just looking for him to inquire. (Then as he sees 

Chanter : re-enter Captain Chanter from the garden.) Have yOU Secn 

the member for Blackport ? 

CHANTER. 
He's in the garden. (Agitated, blanched, to Paul as Mr. Bonsor 

goes up.) I can't do it ! 

PAUL. 

She hasn't got them ! 

Re-enter Mrs. Doubleday from the hall. 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, with a large sealed packet and with energy, as 
Chanter moves quickly away from Paul and she sees Mr. Bonsor going. 

Mr. Bonsor ! (Then as he obediently comes down with her.) Be 

present ! That's more, apparently, than Captain 
Chanter had courage to be ! 

PAUL. 

Dear Mamma, he has come back for you. 



404 THE REPROBATE 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 
I've come back for him I (Then having looked hard from one of 
them to the other ; holding out her packet to Chanter.) Break thoSC 

seals ! (To Mr. BoNsoR.) The instructions. 

MR. BONSOR. 

A new lot ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

For the new crisis. The supreme measures. 

MR. BONSOR, complacent. 

Our second line of defence ! 

PAUL. 

Abandon, Captain, your second line. We'll dispense 

with the supreme measures. (Then as Chanter stares.) 

Touch the seals at your peril. Give me the packet 

CHANTER, with his packet ; tormented, perplexed, to Mrs. Doubleday. 

What will be the penalty, love, of my surrendering my 
precious charge ? 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

The inevitable inference that you have reasons for 

grovelling before your pupil. (After an instant ; formidable.) 

He has seen the fatal letters. 

MR. BONSOR, blank but prompt. 

Where are they to be seen ? 



ACT THIRD 40s 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY. 

That's exactly what I want to know ! Paul doesn't 
deny the impeachment. 

CHANTER, scandalised, tossing his packet to a table. 

Then I call upon him instantly to do so. (To Paul.) 
What letters does your mother mean ? 

PAUL, after a moment. 
I let the cat out of the bag ! (Then as Pitt Brunt reappears.) 

The fatal letters exist ! 

Re-enter Pitt Brunt from the garden. 
PITT BRUNT, struck, coming quickly down as Blanche reappears. 

The fatal letters exist ! 

Re-enter Blanche Amber by the lower door on the right. 
CHANTER, amazed, to Pitt Brunt. 

How the devil, sir, do you know ? 

PITT BRUNT, arrested, conciliatory. 

I hasten to explain, sir, that I don't attribute them to 
you ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, astonished. 

Then to whom in the world do you attribute them ? 

BLANCHE, precipitate, very loud. 

Ahem ! 



406 THE REPROBATE 

PAUL, while the others stare in surprise at her ambiguous ejaculation. 

I'll save Mr. firunt the trouble of saying. (After a moment.) 
The fatal letters are mine ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, blank. 

Then who in the world has them ? 

BLANCHE, passing close to Pitt Brunt ; privately, with ferocity. 

Say at your peril I 

PAUL, to Mrs. DoUBLEDAY. 

I thought they had come into your hands. (Then indicating 
Chanter.) Take him away to beg his pardon. 

CHANTER, to Mrs. Doubled ay, smiling. 

Naughty doubting dear ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, breathing again, but severe. 

Naughty frightening man ! 

PAUL, impatient ; motioning them off. 

Oh, make it up somewhere else ! 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, startled, giving ground, but hesitating. 

Without the instructions ? 

PAUL. 

You evidently require no teaching ! (Then highly authoritative.) 
Go! 



ACT THIRD 407 

MRS. DOUBLEDAY, who has hurried up ; to Chanter, at the door 
to the hall. 

Come ! 

Exit Mrs. DOUBLEDAY. 

CHANTER, uneasy ; privately to Paul. 

But the letters ? 

PAUL. 

I'll find them ! 

CHANTER, up at the door to the hall ; aloud. 

Reprobate ! 

Exit Captain Chanter. 

PAUL, at the left ; peremptory, to Mr. Bonsor and Pitt Brunt, who have 
been conversing down at the right. 

Leave me alone with Miss Amber ! 

BLANCHE. 

I require to be alone with Mr. Paul. 

MR. BONSOR. 

You will neither of you have forgotten that / wish to be 
alone — 

PAUL. 

With the member for Blackport ? So do // But I'll 
take him later. 

PITT BRUNT. 

I shall suffer nothing to blind me to the fact that I have 
still my hour to put in. 



4o8 THE REPROBATE 

MR. BONSOR. 
On the water? You can take .me out — I'll join you 

directly in the garden. (Then to Paul, while Pitt Brunt, intensely 
preoccupied, approaches Blanche.) Reprobate ! 

Exit Mr. BoMSOR to the hall. 

PITT BRUNT, to Blanche. 

You accept the shocking evidence ? 

BLANCHE. . . 

Of an existing connection ? — I accept everything ! 

PITT BRUNT, up at the window, scandalised. 

I call it immorality ! 

Exit Pitt Brunt to the garden. 
BLANCHE, to Paul. 

I daresay it is ; but I forgive you. 

PAUL, vague. 

For saying such a thing ? 

BLANCHE. 

For doing it ! / have the letters ! 

PAUL, amazed. 

How in the world — ? 

BLANCHE. 

In my room — from Mr. Brunt. 



ACT THIRD 409 

PAUL, bewildered. 

How did Mr. Brunt get them ? 

BLANCHE. 

I give it up ! But I'm keeping them for you. 

PAUL, anxious. 

Don't " keep " them — bring them to me ! (Then checking her 
as she is going.) But there's Something you can keep for me. 

(Placing in her hands the sealed packet.) Keep this ! 

BLANCHE, with the packet, exalted, at the lower door on the right. 

To the death ! 

Exit Blanche Amber. Re-enter Mrs. Freshville from the hajl. 
PAUL, nervous, curt. 

I've been too busy to come back to you — and I'm too 
busy to converse with you now ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

You're a very superior person, Dud; but you can be 
awfully nasty when you like. You know I've declined 
to leave the house without that memento — doubly dear 
to me now — of our brighter and happier hours. Your 
precious photo has been appropriated, and after very 
patiently and very vainly waiting there for you to recover 
it for me, I demand here the production of my property. 

PAUL. 

Accept as a substitute, my dear Nina, the assurance 
that I'll be taken again ! 



410 THE REPROBATE 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

What I desire, Dudley, is the representation of your 
more juvenile and — since you force me to say so — your 
more attractive personality. 

PAUL, alanned, as Pitt Brunt reappears. 

Don't bring it up — there's some one there ! 

Re-enter Pitt Brunt from the garden. 
MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

You gave her the letters ? 

PITT BRUNT, embarrassed. 

She has them in her hands. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

And what does she say about the shocking evidence — 

PITT BRUNT. 

Of an existing connection ? She accepts it. She accepts 
everything ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, stupefied. 

Everything ? Then she's a cat ! 

PITT BRUNT, emphatic. 

She's a cat ! 

PAUL, smiling. 

No — she's only a woman in love ! (To PittBrunt, who stands 
blank.) Have you come back for something ? 



ACT THIRD 4" 

PITT BRUNT. 
For Mr. Bonsor — to put in my hour. 

PAUL. 
I daresay he's dressing. (Then with a happy thought ; inspired.) 

Put it in with Mrs. Freshville ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, struck. 

On the river — the dear old river ? 

PITT BRUNT, struck. 

I put in an hour each day. (After an instant, engaging.) Could 
you give me as much as that ? 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, looking from Pitt Brunt to Paul. 

By-bye? 

PAUL. 

By-bye ! 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, giving her reticule to Pitt Brunt. 

Stick it in the boat. 

PITT BRUNT, alert, with the reticule ; up at the window, to Paul. 

Patch it up with Mr. Bonsor ! 

Exit Pitt Brunt to the garden. 
MRS. FRESHVILLE, after a moment ; thoughtful. 

Not engaged ? 

PAUL. 

I can answer for that ! 



412 THE REPROBATE 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

Much of a swell ? 

PAUL, handmg her from the table the copy of the " society-paper." 

The papers are full of him. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, with the cartoon.

PAUL. 

The young man of the hour. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE. 

More than ever you were ! By-bye.

By-bye. 

MRS. FRESHVILLE, with the copy of the paper under her arm ; up 
at the window, contemptuous, sarcastic. 

Perfection ! 

Exit Mrs. FRESHVILLE to the garden 
Re-enter Captain Chanter from the hall. 
CHANTER, anxious. 

Has she gone ? 

PAUL, coming down from the window, indicating the garden, while Chanter, 
interrogative, goes up, and Blanche and Mr. Bonsor reappear. 



She has found an opening ! 



ACT THIRD 413 

Re-enter Blanche Amber by the lower door on the right. Re-enter Mr. 
BoNSOR, in boating costume, from the hall. 

BLANCHE, with Mrs. Freshville's letters, eager, to Paul. 

Here are the letters ! 

CHANTER, struck, turning, bounding down to grab them. 

Mine ! 

PAUL, smiling, having seized them first. 

Mine ! 

CHANTER, to Blanche, resentful. 

You should have given them to me ! 

BLANCHE. 

They belong to the writer. 

CHANTER. 

He's not the writer ! 

BLANCHE, aghast, to Paul. 

You're not the writer? 

PAUL. 

I blush to confess it — Pm so much less bad than you 
want me ! 

CHANTER. 

He took them on himself to save his friend. 

BLANCHE, struck, eager. 

He told a glorious lie ? 

PAUL, laughing, while he tosses Chanter the packet of letters. 

Don't mention it ! 



414 THE REPROBATE 

BLANCHE, overjoyed. 

But I don't want you any worse than that! 

MR. BONSOR, to Chanter. 

Are you very sure his friend is saved ? 

PAUL. 

Not if you basely blab, Mr. Bonsor. 

CHANTER, confident, complacent. 

Oh, he may basely blab ! (After an instant.) Fm sure ! 

MR. BONSOR, to Blanche. 

But where did you get them ? 

BLANCHE. 

From the member for Blackport. 

MR. BONSOR, blank. 

And where did he get them ? 

PAUL. 

From the lady to whom they were addressed. 

MR. BONSOR, startled. 

Nina — the unspeakable Nina? (indignant.) He never 
went near her ! 

PAUL. 

He's remarkably near her now — he's out on the river 
with her ! 



ACT THIRD 415 

MR. BONSOR, stupefied. 

Then it was for him the woman came ? 

PAUL. 

She came for a certain photograph ! 

MR. BONSOR, struck. 

I remember ! (Looking ineflfectuaiiy round.) What on earth 
became of it ? 

BLANCHE, producing it from her pocket. 

Here it is ! 

MR. BONSOR, to the others, amazed. 

She had it all the while ? 

BLANCHE, embarrassed, hesitating. 

I took it because — because — 

PAUL, radiant. 

You must keep the reason for me t 

BLANCHE. 
May I tell him, uncle ? 

MR. BONSOR. 

Tell him what you like ! (Then looking at her a moment in be- 
wildered abstraction, raising and dropping his arms at his sides in helpless and 
humiliated renunciation and going up.) The Idol of the Nofth ! 

PAUL, ardent, triumphant, with his two hands out. 

Blanche !

BLANCHE, meeting him in happy freedom while he takes both her hands and 
respectfully kisses them.

Re-enter Mrs. Doublbday from the hall. 
MRS. DOUBLEDAY, startled, instinctive, loud, as before. 

Paul ! 

CHANTER, eager, as the others, absorbed, pay no attention. 
It's all right ! (Then, irresistible, as Mrs. Doubleday surrenders herself 
to his endearment.) Beloved ! 

PAUL, suddenly observing, good-naturedly but loudly and ominously warning, 
while Mrs. Doubleday gives a violent start. 

Mamma ! 



THE END
