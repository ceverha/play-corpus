NISHIKIGI


A PLAY IN TWO ACTS BY MOTOKIYO.


PERSONS OF THE PLAY


THE WAKI                A priest

THE SHITE, OR HERO      Ghost of the lover

TSURE                   Ghost of the woman; they have both been long
dead, and have not yet been united.

CHORUS

The 'Nishikigi' are wands used as a love charm.

'Hosonuno' is the name of a local cloth which the
woman weaves.



NISHIKIGI


First Part

WAKI
There never was anybody heard of Mount Shinobu but had a kindly feeling
for it; so I, like any other priest that might want to know a little bit
about each one of the provinces, may as well be walking up here along the
much travelled road.

I have not yet been about the east country, but now I have set my mind to
go as far as the earth goes; and why shouldn't I, after all? seeing that
I go about with my heart set upon no particular place whatsoever, and
with no other man's flag in my hand, no more than a cloud has. It is a
flag of the night I see coming down upon me. I wonder now, would the sea
be that way, or the little place Kefu that they say is stuck down against
it?

SHITE (to Tsure)
Times out of mind am I here setting up this bright branch, this silky
wood with the charms painted in it as fine as the web you'd get in the
grass-cloth of Shinobu, that they'd be still selling you in this
mountain.

SHITE AND TSURE
Tangled, we are entangled. Whose fault was it, dear? tangled up as the
grass patterns are tangled up in this coarse cloth, or as the little
Mushi that lives on and chirrups in dried sea-weed. We do not know where
are to-day our tears in the undergrowth of this eternal wilderness. We
neither wake nor sleep, and passing our nights in a sorrow which is in
the end a vision, what are these scenes of spring to us? This thinking in
sleep of someone who has no thought of you, is it more than a dream? and
yet surely it is the natural way of love. In our hearts there is much and
in our bodies nothing, and we do nothing at all, and only the waters of
the river of tears flow quickly.

CHORUS
Narrow is the cloth of Kefu, but wild is that river, that torrent of the
hills, between the beloved and the bride.

The cloth she had woven is faded, the thousand one hundred nights were
night-trysts watched out in vain.

WAKI (not recognizing the nature of the speakers)

  Strange indeed, seeing these town-people here.
  They seem like man and wife,
  And the lady seems to be holding something
  Like a cloth woven of feathers,
  While he has a staff or a wooden sceptre
  Beautifully ornate.
  Both of these things are strange;
  In any case, I wonder what they call them.

TSURE

  This is a narrow cloth called 'Hosonuno,'
  It is just the breadth of the loom.

SHITE

  And this is merely wood painted,
  And yet the place is famous because of these things.
  Would you care to buy them from us?

WAKI
Yes, I know that the cloth of this place and the lacquers are famous
things. I have already heard of their glory, and yet I still wonder why
they have such great reputation.

TSURE
Ah well now, that's a disappointment. Here they call the wood Nishikigi,'
and the woven stuff 'Hosonuno,' and yet you come saying that you have
never heard why, and never heard the story. Is it reasonable?

SHITE
No, no, that is reasonable enough. What can people be expected to know of
these affairs when it is more than they can do to keep abreast of their
own?

BOTH (to the Priest)
Ah well, you look like a person who has abandoned the world; it is
reasonable enough that you should not know the worth of wands and cloths
with love's signs painted upon them, with love's marks painted and dyed.

WAKI
That is a fine answer. And you would tell me then that Nishikigi and
Hosonuno are names bound over with love?

SHITE
They are names in love's list surely. Every day for a year, for three
years come to their full, the wands Nishikigi were set up, until there
were a thousand in all. And they are in song in your time, and will be.
'Chidzuka' they call them.

TSURE

  These names are surely a by-word.
  As the cloth Hosonuno is narrow of weft,
  More narrow than the breast,
  We call by this name any woman
  Whose breasts are hard to come nigh to.
  It is a name in books of love.

SHITE
'Tis a sad name to look back on.

TSURE

  A thousand wands were in vain.
  A sad name, set in a story.

SHITE

  A seed-pod void of the seed,
  We had no meeting together.

TSURE
Let him read out the story.

CHORUS

I
  At last they forget, they forget.
  The wands are no longer offered,
  The custom is faded away.
  The narrow cloth of Kefu
  Will not meet over the breast.
  'Tis the story of Hosonuno,
  This is the tale:
  These bodies, having no weft,
  Even now are not come together.
  Truly a shameful story,
  A tale to bring shame on the gods.

II
  Names of love,
  Now for a little spell,
  For a faint charm only,
  For a charm as slight as the binding together
  Of pine-flakes in Iwashiro,
  And for saying a wish over them about sunset,
  We return, and return to our lodging.
  The evening sun leaves a shadow.

WAKI
Go on, tell out all the story.

SHITE
There is an old custom of this country. We make wands of meditation, and
deck them with symbols, and set them before a gate, when we are suitors.

TSURE
And we women take up a wand of the man we would meet with, and let the
others lie, although a man might come for a hundred nights, it may be, or
for a thousand nights in three years, till there were a thousand wands
here in the shade of this mountain. We know the funeral cave of such a
man, one who had watched out the thousand nights; a bright cave, for they
buried him with all his wands. They have named it the 'Cave of the many
charms.'

WAKI

  I will go to that love-cave,
  It will be a tale to take back to my village.
  Will you show me my way there?

SHITE
So be it, I will teach you the path.

TSURE
Tell him to come over this way.

BOTH

  Here are the pair of them
  Going along before the traveller.

CHORUS

  We have spent the whole day until dusk
  Pushing aside the grass
  From the over-grown way at Kefu,
  And we are not yet come to the cave.
  O you there, cutting grass on the hill,
  Please set your mind on this matter.
  'You'd be asking where the dew is
  'While the frost's lying here on the road.
  'Who'd tell you that now?'
  Very well then don't tell us,
  But be sure we will come to the cave.

SHITE

  There's a cold feel in the autumn.
  Night comes....

CHORUS

  And storms; trees giving up their leaf,
  Spotted with sudden showers.
  Autumn! our feet are clogged
  In the dew-drenched, entangled leaves.
  The perpetual shadow is lonely,
  The mountain shadow is lying alone.
  The owl cries out from the ivies
  That drag their weight on the pine.
  Among the orchids and chrysanthemum flowers
  The hiding fox is now lord of that love-cave,
  Nishidzuka,
  That is dyed like the maple's leaf.
  They have left us this thing for a saying.
  That pair have gone into the cave.
(sign for the exit of Shite and Tsure)


Second Part

(The Waki has taken the posture of sleep. His respectful visit to the
cave is beginning to have its effect.)

WAKI (restless)

  It seems that I cannot sleep
  For the length of a pricket's horn.
  Under October wind, under pines, under night!
  I will do service to Butsu.
(he performs the gestures of a ritual)

TSURE

  Aie! honoured priest!
  You do not dip twice in the river
  Beneath the same tree's shadow
  Without bonds in some other life.
  Hear sooth-say,
  Now is there meeting between us,
  Between us who were until now
  In life and in after-life kept apart.
  A dream-bridge over wild grass,
  Over the grass I dwell in.
  O honoured! do not awake me by force.
  I see that the law is perfect.

SHITE (supposedly invisible)

  It is a good service you have done, sir,
  A service that spreads in two worlds,
  And binds up an ancient love
  That was stretched out between them.
  I had watched for a thousand days.
  Take my thanks,
  For this meeting is under a difficult law.
  And now I will show myself in the form of Nishikigi.
  I will come out now for the first time in colour.

(The characters announce or explain their acts, as these are mostly
symbolical. Thus here the Shite, or Sh'te, announces his change of
costume, and later the dance.)

CHORUS

  The three years are over and past:
  All that is but an old story.

SHITE

  To dream under dream we return.
  Three years.... And the meeting comes now!
  This night has happened over and over,
  And only now comes the tryst.

CHORUS

  Look there to the cave
  Beneath the stems of the Suzuki.
  From under the shadows of the love-grass,
  See, see how they come forth and appear
  For an instant.... Illusion!

SHITE

  There is at the root of hell
  No distinction between princes and commons;
  Wretched for me! 'tis the saying.

WAKI

  Strange, what seemed so very old a cave
  Is all glittering-bright within,
  Like the flicker of fire.
  It is like the inside of a house.
  They are setting up a loom,
  And heaping up charm-sticks. No,
  The hangings are out of old time.
  Is it illusion, illusion?

TSURE

  Our hearts have been in the dark of the falling snow,
  We have been astray in the flurry.
  You should tell better than we
  How much is illusion;
  You who are in the world.
  We have been in the whirl of those who are fading.

SHITE

  Indeed in old times Narihira said,
  --and he has vanished with the years--
  'Let a man who is in the world tell the fact.'
  It is for you, traveller,
  To say how much is illusion.

WAKI

  Let it be a dream, or a vision,
  Or what you will, I care not.
  Only show me the old times over-past and snowed under--
  Now, soon, while the night lasts.

SHITE

  Look then, the old times are shown,
  Faint as the shadow-flower shows in the grass that bears it;
  And you've but a moon for lanthorn.

TSURE

  The woman has gone into the cave.
  She sets up her loom there
  For the weaving of Hosonuno,
  Thin as the heart of Autumn.

SHITE

  The suitor for his part, holding his charm-sticks,
  Knocks on a gate which was barred.

TSURE

  In old time he got back no answer,
  No secret sound at all
  Save....

SHITE
The sound of the loom.

TSURE

  It was a sweet sound like katydids and crickets,
  A thin sound like the Autumn.

SHITE
It was what you would hear any night.

TSURE

  Kiri.

SHITE

    Hatari.

TSURE

      Cho.

SHITE

        Cho.

CHORUS (mimicking the sound of crickets)

  Kiri, hatari, cho, cho,
  Kiri, hatari, cho, cho.
  The cricket sews on at his old rags,
  With all the new grass in the field; sho,
  Churr, isho, like the whir of a loom: churr.

CHORUS (antistrophe)

  Let be, they make grass-cloth in Kefu,
  Kefu, the land's end, matchless in the world.

SHITE

  That is an old custom, truly,
  But this priest would look on the past.

CHORUS

  The good priest himself would say:
  Even if we weave the cloth, Hosonuno,
  And set up the charm-sticks
  For a thousand, a hundred nights,
  Even then our beautiful desire will not pass,
  Nor fade nor die out.

SHITE

  Even to-day the difficulty of our meeting is remembered,
  And is remembered in song.

CHORUS

  That we may acquire power,
  Even in our faint substance,
  We will show forth even now,
  And though it be but in a dream,
  Our form of repentance.
(explaining the movement of the Shite and Tsure)
  There he is carrying wands,
  And she has no need to be asked.
  See her within the cave,
  With a cricket-like noise of weaving.
  The grass-gates and the hedge are between them;
  That is a symbol.
  Night has already come on.
(now explaining the thoughts of the man's spirit)
  Love's thoughts are heaped high within him,
  As high as the charm-sticks,
  As high as the charm-sticks, once coloured,
  Now fading, lie heaped in this cave.
  And he knows of their fading. He says:
  I lie a body, unknown to any other man,
  Like old wood buried in moss.
  It were a fit thing
  That I should stop thinking the love-thoughts.
  The charm-sticks fade and decay,
  And yet,
  The rumour of our love
  Takes foot and moves through the world.
  We had no meeting
  But tears have, it seems, brought out a bright blossom
  Upon the dyed tree of love.

SHITE

  Tell me, could I have foreseen
  Or known what a heap of my writings
  Should lie at the end of her shaft-bench?

CHORUS

  A hundred nights and more
  Of twisting, encumbered sleep,
  And now they make it a ballad,
  Not for one year or for two only
  But until the days lie deep
  As the sand's depth at Kefu,
  Until the year's end is red with Autumn,
  Red like these love-wands,
  A thousand nights are in vain.
  And I stand at this gate-side.
  You grant no admission, you do not show yourself
  Until I and my sleeves are faded.
  By the dew-like gemming of tears upon my sleeve,
  Why will you grant no admission?
  And we all are doomed to pass,
  You, and my sleeves and my tears.
  And you did not even know when three years had come to an end.
  Cruel, ah cruel!
  The charm-sticks....

SHITE

  Were set up a thousand times;
  Then, now, and for always.

CHORUS
Shall I ever at last see into that room of hers, which no other sight has
traversed?

SHITE

  Happy at last and well-starred,
  Now comes the eve of betrothal:
  We meet for the wine-cup.

CHORUS

  How glorious the sleeves of the dance,
  That are like snow-whirls!

SHITE
Tread out the dance.

CHORUS

  Tread out the dance and bring music.
  This dance is for Nishikigi.

SHITE
 This dance is for the evening plays,
 And for the weaving.

CHORUS

  For the tokens between lover and lover:
  It is a reflecting in the wine-cup.

CHORUS

  Ari-aki,
  The dawn!
  Come, we are out of place;
  Let us go ere the light comes.
(to the Waki)
  We ask you, do not awake,
  We all will wither away,
  The wands and this cloth of a dream.
  Now you will come out of sleep,
  You tread the border and nothing
  Awaits you: no, all this will wither away.
  There is nothing here but this cave in the field's midst.
  To-day's wind moves in the pines;
  A wild place, unlit, and unfilled.
﻿HAGOROMO



HAGOROMO, A PLAY IN ONE ACT.


PERSONS OF THE PLAY


THE PRIEST             Hakuryo

A FISHERMAN

A TENNIN

CHORUS



HAGOROMO

The plot of the play 'Hagoromo, the Feather-mantle' is as follows. The
priest finds the Hagoromo, the magical feather-mantle of a Tennin, an
aerial spirit or celestial dancer, hanging upon a bough. She demands
its return. He argues with her, and finally promises to return it, if she
will teach him her dance or part of it. She accepts the offer. The Chorus
explains the dance as symbolical of the daily changes of the moon. The
words about 'three, five and fifteen' refer to the number of nights in
the moon's changes. In the finale, the Tennin is supposed to disappear
like a mountain slowly hidden in mist. The play shows the relation of the
early Noh to the God-dance.


PRIEST

  Windy road of the waves by Miwo,
  Swift with ships, loud over steersmen's voices.
  Hakuryo, taker of fish, head of his house,
  Dwells upon the barren pine-waste of Miwo.

A FISHERMAN
Upon a thousand heights had gathered the inexplicable cloud, swept by the
rain. The moon is just come to light the low house. A clean and pleasant
time surely. There comes the breath-colour of spring; the waves rise in a
line below the early mist; the moon is still delaying above, though we've
no skill to grasp it. Here is a beauty to set the mind above itself.

CHORUS

  I shall not be out of memory
  Of the mountain road by Kiyomi,
  Nor of the parted grass by that bay,
  Nor of the far-seen pine-waste
  Of Miwo of wheat stalks.

Let us go according to custom. Take hands against the wind here, for it
presses the clouds and the sea. Those men who were going to fish are
about to return without launching. Wait a little, is it not spring? will
not the wind be quiet? this wind is only the voice of the lasting
pine-trees, ready for stillness. See how the air is soundless, or would be,
were it not for the waves. There now, the fishermen are putting out with
even the smallest boats.

PRIEST
Now I am come to shore at Miwo-no; I disembark in Subara; I see all that
they speak of on the shore. An empty sky with music, a rain of flowers,
strange fragrance on every side; all these are no common things, nor is
this cloak that hangs upon the pine-tree. As I approach to inhale its
colour I am aware of mystery. Its colour-smell is mysterious. I see that
it is surely no common dress. I will take it now and return and make it a
treasure in my house, to show to the aged.

TENNIN
That cloak belongs to someone on this side. What are you proposing to do
with it?

PRIEST
This? this is a cloak picked up. I am taking it home, I tell you.

TENNIN

  That is a feather-mantle not fit for a mortal to bear,
  Not easily wrested from the sky-traversing spirit,
  Not easily taken or given.
  I ask you to leave it where you found it.

PRIEST
How, is the owner of this cloak a Tennin? so be it. In this downcast age
I should keep it, a rare thing, and make it a treasure in the country, a
thing respected. Then I should not return it.

TENNIN
Pitiful, there is no flying without the cloak of feathers, no return
through the ether. I pray you return me the mantle.

PRIEST
Just from hearing these high words, I, Hakuryo have gathered more and yet
more force. You think, because I was too stupid to recognise it, that I
shall be unable to take and keep hid the feather-robe, that I shall give
it back for merely being told to stand and withdraw?

TENNIN

  A Tennin without her robe,
  A bird without wings,
  How shall she climb the air?

PRIEST
And this world would be a sorry place for her to dwell in?

TENNIN
I am caught, I struggle, how shall I?...

PRIEST
No, Hakuryo is not one to give back the robe.

TENNIN
Power does not attain....

PRIEST
To get back the robe.

CHORUS
Her coronet [1] jewelled as with the dew of tears, even the flowers that
decorated her hair drooping, and fading, the whole chain of weaknesses
[2] of the dying Tennin can be seen actually before the eyes. Sorrow!

[Footnote 1: Vide examples of state head-dress of kingfisher feathers, in
the South Kensington Museum.]

[Footnote 2: The chain of weaknesses, or the five ills, diseases of the
Tennin: namely, the hanakadzusa withers; the Hagoromo is stained; sweat
comes from the body; both eyes wink frequently; she feels very weary of
her palace in heaven.]

TENNIN
I look into the flat of heaven, peering; the cloud-road is all hidden and
uncertain; we are lost in the rising mist; I have lost the knowledge of
the road. Strange, a strange sorrow!

CHORUS
Enviable colour of breath, wonder of clouds that fade along the sky that
was our accustomed dwelling; hearing the sky-bird, accustomed and well
accustomed, hearing the voices grow fewer, the wild geese fewer and fewer
along the highways of air, how deep her longing to return. Plover and
seagull are on the waves in the offing. Do they go, or do they return?
She reaches out for the very blowing of the spring wind against heaven.

PRIEST (to the Tennin)
What do you say? now that I can see you in your sorrow, gracious, of
heaven, I bend and would return you your mantle.

TENNIN
It grows clearer. No, give it this side.

PRIEST
First tell me your nature, who are you, Tennin? give payment with the
dance of the Tennin, and I will return you your mantle.

TENNIN
Readily and gladly, and then I return into heaven. You shall have what
pleasure you will, and I will leave a dance here, a joy to be new among
men and to be memorial dancing. Learn then this dance that can turn the
palace of the moon. No, come here to learn it. For the sorrows of the
world I will leave this new dancing with you for sorrowful people. But
give me my mantle, I cannot do the dance rightly without it.

PRIEST
Not yet, for if you should get it, how do I know you'll not be off to
your palace without even beginning your dance, not even a measure?

TENNIN
Doubt is fitting for mortals; with us there is no deceit.

PRIEST
I am again ashamed. I give you your mantle.

CHORUS
The young maid now is arrayed; she assumes the curious mantle; watch how
she moves in the dance of the rainbow-feathered garment.

PRIEST
The heavenly feather-robe moves in accord with the wind.

TENNIN
The sleeves of flowers are being wet with the rain.

PRIEST
The wind and the sleeve move together.

CHORUS

  It seems that she dances.
  Thus was the dance of pleasure,
  Suruga dancing, brought to the sacred east.
  Thus was it when the lords of the everlasting
  Trod the world,
  They being of old our friends.
  Upon ten sides their sky is without limit,
  They have named it on this account, 'the enduring.'

TENNIN
The jewelled axe takes up the eternal renewing, the palace of the
moon-god is being renewed with the jewelled axe, and this is always
recurring.

CHORUS (commenting on the dance)
  The white kiromo, the black kiromo,
  Three, five into fifteen,
  The figure that the Tennin is dividing.
  There are heavenly nymphs, Amaotome, [3]
  One for each night of the month,
  And each with her deed assigned.

[Footnote 3: Cf. 'Paradiso,' xxiii, 25. 'Quale nei plenilunii sereni
Trivia ride tra le ninfe eterne.']

TENNIN
I also am heaven-born and a maid, Amaotome. Of them there are many. This
is the dividing of my body, that is fruit of the moon's tree, Katsuma.
[4] This is one part of our dance that I leave to you here in your world.

[Footnote 4: A tree something like the laurel.]

CHORUS
The spring mist is widespread abroad; so perhaps the wild olive's flower
will blossom in the infinitely unreachable moon. Her flowery
head-ornament is putting on colour; this truly is sign of the spring. Not
sky is here, but the beauty; and even here comes the heavenly, wonderful
wind. O blow, shut the accustomed path of the clouds. O, you in the form
of a maid, grant us the favour of your delaying. The pine-waste of Miwo
puts on the colour of spring. The bay of Kiyomi lies clear before the
snow upon Fuji. Are not all these presages of the spring? There are but
few ripples beneath the piny wind. It is quiet along the shore. There is
naught but a fence of jewels between the earth and the sky, and the gods
within and without, [5] beyond and beneath the stars, and the moon
unclouded by her lord, and we who are born of the sun. This alone
intervenes, here where the moon is unshadowed, here in Nippon, the sun's
field.

[Footnote 5: 'Within and without,' gei, gu, two parts of the temple]

TENNIN
The plumage of heaven drops neither feather nor flame to its own
diminution.

CHORUS
Nor is this rock of earth over-much worn by the brushing of that
feather-mantle, the feathery skirt of the stars: rarely, how rarely.
There is a magic song from the east, the voices of many and many: and
flute and shae, filling the space beyond the cloud's edge,
seven-stringed; dance filling and filling. The red sun blots on the sky
the line of the colour-drenched mountains. The flowers rain in a gust;
it is no racking storm that comes over this green moor, which is afloat,
as it would seem, in these waves. Wonderful is the sleeve of the white
cloud, whirling such snow here.

TENNIN
Plain of life, field of the sun, true foundation, great power!

CHORUS
Hence and for ever this dancing shall be called, 'a revel in the east.'
Many are the robes thou hast, now of the sky's colour itself, and now a
green garment.

SEMI-CHORUS
And now the robe of mist, presaging spring, a colour-smell as this
wonderful maiden's skirt--left, right, left! The rustling of flowers, the
putting-on of the feathery sleeve; they bend in air with the dancing.

SEMI-CHORUS
Many are the joys in the east. She who is the colour-person of the moon
takes her middle-night in the sky. She marks her three fives with this
dancing, as a shadow of all fulfilments. The circled vows are at full.
Give the seven jewels of rain and all of the treasure, you who go from
us. After a little time, only a little time, can the mantle be upon the
wind that was spread over Matsubara or over Ashilaka the mountain,
though the clouds lie in its heaven like a plain awash with sea. Fuji is
gone; the great peak of Fuji is blotted out little by little. It melts
into the upper mist. In this way she (the Tennin) is lost to sight.




KUMASAKA


A PLAY IN TWO ACTS BY UJINOBU, ADOPTED SON OF MOTOKIJO.


PERSONS OF THE PLAY


A PRIEST

FIRST SHITE, OR HERO    The apparition of Kumasaka in the form of an old
                        priest

SECOND SHITE            The apparition of Kumasaka in his true form.

CHORUS      This chorus sometimes speaks what the chief
characters are thinking, sometimes it describes

who killed him in single combat.



KUMASAKA


First Part

PRIEST
Where shall I rest, wandering, weary of the world? I am a city-bred
priest, I have not seen the east counties, and I've a mind to go there.
Crossing the hills, I look on the lake of Omi, on the woods of Awatsu.
Going over the long bridge at Seta, I rested a night at Noje, and another
at Shinohara, and at the dawn I came to the green field, Awono in Miwo. I
now pass Akasaka at sunset.

SHITE (In the form of an old priest)
I could tell that priest a thing or two.

PRIEST
Do you mean me, what is it?

SHITE
A certain man died on this day. I ask you to pray for him.

PRIEST
All right, but for whom shall I pray?

SHITE
I will not tell you his name, but his grave lies in the green field
beyond that tall pine tree. He cannot enter to the gates of Paradise, and
so I ask you to pray.

PRIEST
But I do not think it is proper to pray unless you tell me his name.

SHITE
No, no; you can pray the prayer, Ho kai shijo biodo riaku; that would do.

PRIEST (praying)
Unto all mortals let there be equal grace, to pass from this life of
agony by the gates of death into law, into the peaceful kingdom.

SHITE (saying first a word or two)
If you pray for him,--

CHORUS (continuing the sentence)
If you pray with the prayer of 'Exeat' he will be thankful, and you need
not be aware of his name. They say that prayer can be heard for even the
grass and the plants, for even the sand and the soil here; and they will
surely hear it, if you pray for an unknown man.

SHITE
Will you enter? This is my cottage.

PRIEST
This is your house? Very well, I will hold the service in your house; but
I see no picture of Buddha nor any wooden image in this cottage, nothing
but a long spear on one wall and an iron stick in place of a priest's
wand, and many arrows. What are these for?

SHITE (thinking)
Yes, this priest is still in the first stage of faith. (aloud) As you
see, there are many villages here: Zorii, Awohaka, and Akasaka. But the
tall grass of Awo-no-ga-kara grows round the roads between them, and the
forest is thick at Koyasu and Awohaka, and many robbers come out under
the rains. They attack the baggage on horseback, and take the clothing of
maids and servants who pass here. So I go out with this spear.

PRIEST
That's very fine, isn't it?

CHORUS
You will think it very strange for a priest to do this; but even Buddha
has the sharp sword of Mida, and Aijen Miowo has arrows, and Tamon,
taking his long spear, throws down the evil spirits.

SHITE
The deep love.

CHORUS
--is excellent. Good feeling and keeping order are much more excellent
than the love of Bosatsu. 'I think of these matters and know little of
anything else. It is from my own heart that I am lost, wandering. But if
I begin talking I shall keep on talking until dawn. Go to bed, good
father; I will sleep too.' He seemed to be going to his bedroom, but
suddenly his figure disappeared, and the cottage became a field of grass.
The priest passes the night under the pine trees.

PRIEST
I cannot sleep out the night. Perhaps if I held my service during the
night under this pine tree....

(He begins his service for the dead man.)

Second Part

SECOND SHITE
There are winds in the east and south; the clouds are not calm in the
west; and in the north the wind of the dark evening blusters; and under
the shade of the mountain--

CHORUS
There is a rustling of boughs and leaves.

SECOND SHITE
Perhaps there will be moon-shine to-night, but the clouds veil the sky;
the moon will not break up their shadow. 'Have at them!' 'Ho there!'
'Dash in!' That is the way I would shout, calling and ordering my men
before and behind, my bowmen and horsemen. I plundered men of their
treasure, that was my work in the world, and now I must go on; it is
sorry work for a spirit.

PRIEST
Are you Kumasaka Chohan? Tell me the tale of your years.

SECOND SHITE (now known as Kumasaka)
There were great merchants in Sanjo, Yoshitsugu, and Nobutaka; they
collected treasure each year; they sent rich goods up to Oku. It was then
I assailed their trains. Would you know what men were with me?

PRIEST
Tell me the chief men, were they from many a province?

KUMASAKA
There was Kakusho of Kawachi, there were the two brothers Suriharitaro;
they have no rivals in fencing. (omotenchi, face to face attack)

PRIEST
What chiefs came to you from the city?

KUMASAKA
Emoi of Sanjo, Kozari of Mibu.

PRIEST
In the fighting with torches and in mêlée--

KUMASAKA
They had no equals.

PRIEST
In northern Hakoku?

KUMASAKA
Were Aso no Matsuwaka and Mikune no Kure.

PRIEST
In Kaga?

KUMASAKA
No, Chohan was the head there. There were seventy comrades who were very
strong and skilful.

CHORUS
While Yoshitsugu was going along in the fields and on the mountains we
set many spies to take him.

KUMASAKA
Let us say that he is come to the village of Ubasike. This is the best
place to attack him. There are many ways to escape if we are defeated,
and he has invited many guests and has had a great feast at the inn.

PRIEST
When the night was advanced the brothers Yoshitsugu and Nobutaka fell
asleep.

KUMASAKA
But there was a small boy with keen eyes, about sixteen or seventeen
years old, and he was looking through a little hole in the partition,
alert to the slightest noise.

PRIEST
He did not sleep even a wink.

KUMASAKA
We did not know it was Ushiwaka.

PRIEST
It was fate.

KUMASAKA
The hour had come.

PRIEST
Be quick!

KUMASAKA
Have at them!

CHORUS (describing the original combat, now symbolized in the dance)
At this word they rushed in, one after another. They seized the torches;
it seemed as if gods could not face them. Ushiwaka stood unafraid; he
seized a small sword and fought like a lion in earnest, like a tiger
rushing, like a bird swooping. He fought so cleverly that he felled the
thirteen who opposed him; many were wounded besides. They fled without
swords or arrows. Then Kumasaka said, 'Are you the devil? Is it a god who
has struck down these men with such ease? Perhaps you are not a man.
However, dead men take no plunder, and I'd rather leave this truck of
Yoshitsugu's than my corpse.' So he took his long spear and was about to
make off.

KUMASAKA
--But Kumasaka thought--

CHORUS (taking it up)
What can he do, that young chap, if I ply my secret arts freely? Be he
god or devil, I will grasp him and grind him. I will offer his body as
sacrifice to those whom he has slain. So he drew back, and holding
his long spear against his side he hid himself behind the door and stared
at the young lad. Ushiwaka beheld him, and holding his sword at his side
he crouched at a little distance. Kumasaka waited likewise. They both
waited, alertly; then Kumasaka stepped forth swiftly with his left foot,
and struck out with the long spear. It would have run through an iron
wall. Ushiwaka parried it lightly, swept it away, left volted. Kumasaka
followed and again lunged out with the spear, and Ushiwaka parried
the spear-blade quite lightly. Then Kumasaka turned the edge of his
spear-blade towards Ushiwaka and slashed at him, and Ushiwaka leaped to
the right. Kumasaka lifted his spear and the two weapons were twisted
together. Ushiwaka drew back his blade. Kumasaka swung with his spear.
Ushiwaka led up and stepped into shadow.

Kumasaka tried  to find him, and Ushiwaka slit through the back-chink of
his armour; this seemed the end of his course, and he was wroth to be
slain by such a young boy.

KUMASAKA
Slowly the wound--

CHORUS
--seemed to pierce; his heart failed; weakness o'ercame him.

KUMASAKA
At the foot of this pine tree--

CHORUS
He vanished like a dew.

And so saying, he disappeared among the shades of the pine tree at
Akasaka, and night fell.

TSURE                         Hime his daughter, called also Hitomaru

TOMO                          Her attendant

WAKI                          A villager

CHORUS

The scene is in Hinga.



KAGEKIYO



HIME AND TOMO (chanting)
What should it be; the body of dew, wholly at the mercy of wind?

HIME

  I am a girl named Hitomaru from Kamega-engayatsu,
  My father, Akushichi-bioye Kagekiyo,
  Fought by the side of Heike,
  And is therefore hated by Genji.
  He was banished to Miyazaki in Hinga,
  To waste out the end of his life.
  Though I am unaccustomed to travel,
  I will try to go to my father.

HIME AND TOMO (describing the journey as they walk across the bridge and
the stage)
  Sleeping with the grass for our pillow,
  The dew has covered our sleeves.
(singing)
  Of whom shall I ask my way
  As I go out from Tagami province?
  Of whom in Totomi?
  I crossed the bay in a small hired boat
  And came to Yatsuhashi in Mikawa:
  Ah when shall I see the City-on-the-cloud?

TOMO
As we have come so fast, we are now in Miyazaki of Hinga.

It is here you should ask for your father.

KAGEKIYO (in another corner of the stage)
Sitting at the gate of the pine wood, I wear out the end of my years. I
cannot see the clear light, I know not how the time passes. I sit here in
this dark hovel, with one coat for the warm and the cold, and my body is
but a frame-work of bones.

CHORUS
May as well be a priest with black sleeves. Now having left the world in
sorrow, I look upon my withered shape. There is no one to pity me now.

HIME
Surely no one can live in that ruin, and yet a voice sounds from it. A
beggar perhaps, let us take a few steps and see.

KAGEKIYO
My eyes will not show it me, yet the autumn wind is upon us.

HIME
The wind blows from an unknown past, and spreads our doubts through the
world. The wind blows, and I have no rest, nor any place to find quiet.

KAGEKIYO
Neither in the world of passion, nor in the world of colour, nor in the
world of non-colour, is there any such place of rest; beneath the one sky
are they all. Whom shall I ask, and how answer?

TOMO
Shall I ask the old man by the thatch?

KAGEKIYO
Who are you?

TOMO
Where does the exile live?

KAGEKIYO
What exile?

TOMO
One who is called Akushichi-bioye Kagekiyo, a noble who fought under
Heike.

KAGEKIYO
Indeed? I have heard of him, but I am blind, I have not looked in his
face. I have heard of his wretched condition and pity him. You had better
ask for him at the next place.

TOMO (to Hime)
It seems that he is not here, shall we ask further?
(they pass on)

KAGEKIYO
Strange, I feel that woman who has just passed is the child of that blind
man. Long ago I loved a courtezan in Atsuta, one time when I was in that
place. But I thought our girl-child would be no use to us, and I left her
with the head man in the valley of Kamega-engayatsu; and now she has gone
by me and spoken, although she does not know who I am.

CHORUS

  Although I have heard her voice,
  The pity is that I cannot see her.
  And I have let her go by
  Without divulging my name.
  This is the true love of a father.

TOMO (at further side of the stage)
Is there any native about?

VILLAGER
What do you want with me?

TOMO
Do you know where the exile lives?

VILLAGER
What exile is it you want?

TOMO
Akushichi-bioye  Kagekiyo, a noble  of Heike's party.

VILLAGER
Did you not pass an old man under the edge of the mountain, as you were
coming that way?

TOMO
A blind beggar in a thatched cottage.

VILLAGER
That fellow was Kagekiyo. What ails the lady? she shivers.

TOMO
A question you might well ask. She is the exile's daughter. She wanted to
see her father once more, and so came hither to seek him. Will you take
us to Kagekiyo?

VILLAGER
Bless my soul! Kagekiyo's daughter. Come, come, never mind, young miss.
Now I will tell you, Kagekiyo went blind in both eyes, and so he shaved
his crown and called himself 'The Blind man of Hinga.' He begs a bit from
the passers, and the likes of us keep him; he'd be ashamed to tell you
his name. However, I'll come along with you, and then I'll call out,
'Kagekiyo;' and if he comes, you can see him and have a word with him.
Let us along, (they cross the stage, and the villager calls) Kagekiyo, Oh
there, Kagekiyo!

KAGEKIYO
Noise, noise! Someone came from my home to call me, but I sent them on. I
couldn't be seen like this. Tears like the thousand lines in a rain
storm, bitter tears soften my sleeve. Ten thousand things rise in a
dream, and I wake in this hovel, wretched, just a nothing in the wide
world. How can I answer when they call me by my right name?

CHORUS
Do not call out the name he had in his glory. You will move the bad blood
in his heart, (then taking up Kagekiyo's thought) I am angry.

KAGEKIYO
Living here....

CHORUS (going on with Kagekiyo's thought)
I go on living here, hated by the people in power. A blind man without
his staff, I am deformed, and therefore speak evil; excuse me.

KAGEKIYO
My eyes are darkened.

CHORUS
Though my eyes are dark I understand the thoughts of another. I
understand at a word. The wind comes down from the pine trees on the
mountain, and snow comes down after the wind. The dream tells of my
glory, I am loth to wake from the dream. I hear the waves running in the
evening tide, as when I was with Heike. Shall I act out the old ballad?

KAGEKIYO (to the villager)
I had a weight on my mind, I spoke to you very harshly, excuse me.

VILLAGER
You're always like that, never mind it. Has anyone been here to see you?

KAGEKIYO
No one but you.

VILLAGER
Go on, that is not true. Your daughter was here. Why couldn't you tell
her the truth, she being so sad and so eager. I have brought her back
now. Come now, speak with your father. Come along.

HIME
O, O, I came such a long journey, under rain, under wind, wet with dew,
over the frost; you do not see into my heart. It seems that a father's
love goes when the child is not worth it.

KAGEKIYO
I meant to keep it concealed, but now they have found it all out. I shall
drench you with the dew of my shame, you who are young as a flower. I
tell you my name, and that we are father and child; yet I thought this
would put dishonour upon you, and therefore I let you pass. Do not hold
it against me.

CHORUS
At first I was angry that my friends would no longer come near me. But
now I have come to a time when I could not believe that even a child of
my own would seek me out.

 (singing)
  Upon all the boats of the men of Heike's faction
  Kagekiyo was the fighter most in call,
  Brave were his men, cunning sailors,
  And now even the leader
  Is worn out and dull as a horse.

VILLAGER (to Kagekiyo)
Many a fine thing is gone, sir; your daughter would like to ask you....

KAGEKIYO
What is it?

VILLAGER
She has heard of your old fame in Uashima. Would you tell her the ballad?

KAGEKIYO
Towards the end of the third month it was, in the third year of Juei. We
men of Heike were in ships, the men of Genji were on land. Their
war-tents stretched on the shore. We awaited decision. And Noto-no-Kami
Noritsune said: 'Last year in the hills of Harima, & in Midzushima, and
in Hiyodorigoye of Bitchiu, we were defeated time and again, for
Yoshitsine is tactful and cunning.' 'Is there any way we can beat them?'
(Kagekiyo thought in his mind) 'This Hangan Yoshitsine is neither god nor
a devil, at the risk of my life I might do it.' So he took leave of
Noritsune and led a party against the shore, and all the men of Genji
rushed on them.

CHORUS
Kagekiyo cried, 'You are haughty.' His armour caught every turn of the
sun. He drove them four ways before them.

KAGEKIYO (excited and crying out)
Samoshiya! Run, cowards!

CHORUS
He thought, how easy this killing. He rushed with his spear-haft gripped
under his arm. He cried out, 'I am Kagekiyo of the Heike.' He rushed on
to take them. He pierced through the helmet vizards of Miyonoya. Miyonoya
fled twice, and again; and Kagekiyo cried, 'You shall not escape me!' He
leaped and wrenched off his helmet. 'Eya!' The vizard broke and remained
in his hand and Miyonoya still fled afar, and afar, and he looked back
crying in terror, 'How terrible, how heavy your arm!' And Kagekiyo called
at him, 'How tough the shaft of your neck is!' And they both laughed out
over the battle, and went off each his own way.

CHORUS
These were the deeds of old, but oh, to tell them! To be telling them
over now in his wretched condition. His life in the world is weary, he is
near the end of his course. 'Go back,' he would say to his daughter.
'Pray for me when I am gone from the world, for I shall then count upon
you as we count on a lamp in the darkness ... we who are blind.' 'I will
stay,' she said. Then she obeyed him, and only one voice is left.

We tell this for the remembrance. Thus were the parent and child.
