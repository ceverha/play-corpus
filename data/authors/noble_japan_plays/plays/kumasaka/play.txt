KUMASAKA


A PLAY IN TWO ACTS BY UJINOBU, ADOPTED SON OF MOTOKIJO.


PERSONS OF THE PLAY


A PRIEST

FIRST SHITE, OR HERO    The apparition of Kumasaka in the form of an old
                        priest

SECOND SHITE            The apparition of Kumasaka in his true form.

CHORUS      This chorus sometimes speaks what the chief
characters are thinking, sometimes it describes
or interprets the meaning of their movements.
Plot: the ghost of Kumasaka makes reparation for
his brigandage by protecting the country. He
comes back to praise the bravery of the young man
who killed him in single combat.



KUMASAKA


First Part

PRIEST
Where shall I rest, wandering, weary of the world? I am a city-bred
priest, I have not seen the east counties, and I've a mind to go there.
Crossing the hills, I look on the lake of Omi, on the woods of Awatsu.
Going over the long bridge at Seta, I rested a night at Noje, and another
at Shinohara, and at the dawn I came to the green field, Awono in Miwo. I
now pass Akasaka at sunset.

SHITE (In the form of an old priest)
I could tell that priest a thing or two.

PRIEST
Do you mean me, what is it?

SHITE
A certain man died on this day. I ask you to pray for him.

PRIEST
All right, but for whom shall I pray?

SHITE
I will not tell you his name, but his grave lies in the green field
beyond that tall pine tree. He cannot enter to the gates of Paradise, and
so I ask you to pray.

PRIEST
But I do not think it is proper to pray unless you tell me his name.

SHITE
No, no; you can pray the prayer, Ho kai shijo biodo riaku; that would do.

PRIEST (praying)
Unto all mortals let there be equal grace, to pass from this life of
agony by the gates of death into law, into the peaceful kingdom.

SHITE (saying first a word or two)
If you pray for him,--

CHORUS (continuing the sentence)
If you pray with the prayer of 'Exeat' he will be thankful, and you need
not be aware of his name. They say that prayer can be heard for even the
grass and the plants, for even the sand and the soil here; and they will
surely hear it, if you pray for an unknown man.

SHITE
Will you enter? This is my cottage.

PRIEST
This is your house? Very well, I will hold the service in your house; but
I see no picture of Buddha nor any wooden image in this cottage, nothing
but a long spear on one wall and an iron stick in place of a priest's
wand, and many arrows. What are these for?

SHITE (thinking)
Yes, this priest is still in the first stage of faith. (aloud) As you
see, there are many villages here: Zorii, Awohaka, and Akasaka. But the
tall grass of Awo-no-ga-kara grows round the roads between them, and the
forest is thick at Koyasu and Awohaka, and many robbers come out under
the rains. They attack the baggage on horseback, and take the clothing of
maids and servants who pass here. So I go out with this spear.

PRIEST
That's very fine, isn't it?

CHORUS
You will think it very strange for a priest to do this; but even Buddha
has the sharp sword of Mida, and Aijen Miowo has arrows, and Tamon,
taking his long spear, throws down the evil spirits.

SHITE
The deep love.

CHORUS
--is excellent. Good feeling and keeping order are much more excellent
than the love of Bosatsu. 'I think of these matters and know little of
anything else. It is from my own heart that I am lost, wandering. But if
I begin talking I shall keep on talking until dawn. Go to bed, good
father; I will sleep too.' He seemed to be going to his bedroom, but
suddenly his figure disappeared, and the cottage became a field of grass.
The priest passes the night under the pine trees.

PRIEST
I cannot sleep out the night. Perhaps if I held my service during the
night under this pine tree....

(He begins his service for the dead man.)

Second Part

SECOND SHITE
There are winds in the east and south; the clouds are not calm in the
west; and in the north the wind of the dark evening blusters; and under
the shade of the mountain--

CHORUS
There is a rustling of boughs and leaves.

SECOND SHITE
Perhaps there will be moon-shine to-night, but the clouds veil the sky;
the moon will not break up their shadow. 'Have at them!' 'Ho there!'
'Dash in!' That is the way I would shout, calling and ordering my men
before and behind, my bowmen and horsemen. I plundered men of their
treasure, that was my work in the world, and now I must go on; it is
sorry work for a spirit.

PRIEST
Are you Kumasaka Chohan? Tell me the tale of your years.

SECOND SHITE (now known as Kumasaka)
There were great merchants in Sanjo, Yoshitsugu, and Nobutaka; they
collected treasure each year; they sent rich goods up to Oku. It was then
I assailed their trains. Would you know what men were with me?

PRIEST
Tell me the chief men, were they from many a province?

KUMASAKA
There was Kakusho of Kawachi, there were the two brothers Suriharitaro;
they have no rivals in fencing. (omotenchi, face to face attack)

PRIEST
What chiefs came to you from the city?

KUMASAKA
Emoi of Sanjo, Kozari of Mibu.

PRIEST
In the fighting with torches and in mêlée--

KUMASAKA
They had no equals.

PRIEST
In northern Hakoku?

KUMASAKA
Were Aso no Matsuwaka and Mikune no Kure.

PRIEST
In Kaga?

KUMASAKA
No, Chohan was the head there. There were seventy comrades who were very
strong and skilful.

CHORUS
While Yoshitsugu was going along in the fields and on the mountains we
set many spies to take him.

KUMASAKA
Let us say that he is come to the village of Ubasike. This is the best
place to attack him. There are many ways to escape if we are defeated,
and he has invited many guests and has had a great feast at the inn.

PRIEST
When the night was advanced the brothers Yoshitsugu and Nobutaka fell
asleep.

KUMASAKA
But there was a small boy with keen eyes, about sixteen or seventeen
years old, and he was looking through a little hole in the partition,
alert to the slightest noise.

PRIEST
He did not sleep even a wink.

KUMASAKA
We did not know it was Ushiwaka.

PRIEST
It was fate.

KUMASAKA
The hour had come.

PRIEST
Be quick!

KUMASAKA
Have at them!

CHORUS (describing the original combat, now symbolized in the dance)
At this word they rushed in, one after another. They seized the torches;
it seemed as if gods could not face them. Ushiwaka stood unafraid; he
seized a small sword and fought like a lion in earnest, like a tiger
rushing, like a bird swooping. He fought so cleverly that he felled the
thirteen who opposed him; many were wounded besides. They fled without
swords or arrows. Then Kumasaka said, 'Are you the devil? Is it a god who
has struck down these men with such ease? Perhaps you are not a man.
However, dead men take no plunder, and I'd rather leave this truck of
Yoshitsugu's than my corpse.' So he took his long spear and was about to
make off.

KUMASAKA
--But Kumasaka thought--

CHORUS (taking it up)
What can he do, that young chap, if I ply my secret arts freely? Be he
god or devil, I will grasp him and grind him. I will offer his body as
sacrifice to those whom he has slain. So he drew back, and holding
his long spear against his side he hid himself behind the door and stared
at the young lad. Ushiwaka beheld him, and holding his sword at his side
he crouched at a little distance. Kumasaka waited likewise. They both
waited, alertly; then Kumasaka stepped forth swiftly with his left foot,
and struck out with the long spear. It would have run through an iron
wall. Ushiwaka parried it lightly, swept it away, left volted. Kumasaka
followed and again lunged out with the spear, and Ushiwaka parried
the spear-blade quite lightly. Then Kumasaka turned the edge of his
spear-blade towards Ushiwaka and slashed at him, and Ushiwaka leaped to
the right. Kumasaka lifted his spear and the two weapons were twisted
together. Ushiwaka drew back his blade. Kumasaka swung with his spear.
Ushiwaka led up and stepped into shadow.

Kumasaka tried  to find him, and Ushiwaka slit through the back-chink of
his armour; this seemed the end of his course, and he was wroth to be
slain by such a young boy.

KUMASAKA
Slowly the wound--

CHORUS
--seemed to pierce; his heart failed; weakness o'ercame him.

KUMASAKA
At the foot of this pine tree--

CHORUS
He vanished like a dew.

And so saying, he disappeared among the shades of the pine tree at
Akasaka, and night fell.
