NISHIKIGI


A PLAY IN TWO ACTS BY MOTOKIYO.


PERSONS OF THE PLAY


THE WAKI                A priest

THE SHITE, OR HERO      Ghost of the lover

TSURE                   Ghost of the woman; they have both been long
dead, and have not yet been united.

CHORUS

The 'Nishikigi' are wands used as a love charm.

'Hosonuno' is the name of a local cloth which the
woman weaves.



NISHIKIGI


First Part

WAKI
There never was anybody heard of Mount Shinobu but had a kindly feeling
for it; so I, like any other priest that might want to know a little bit
about each one of the provinces, may as well be walking up here along the
much travelled road.

I have not yet been about the east country, but now I have set my mind to
go as far as the earth goes; and why shouldn't I, after all? seeing that
I go about with my heart set upon no particular place whatsoever, and
with no other man's flag in my hand, no more than a cloud has. It is a
flag of the night I see coming down upon me. I wonder now, would the sea
be that way, or the little place Kefu that they say is stuck down against
it?

SHITE (to Tsure)
Times out of mind am I here setting up this bright branch, this silky
wood with the charms painted in it as fine as the web you'd get in the
grass-cloth of Shinobu, that they'd be still selling you in this
mountain.

SHITE AND TSURE
Tangled, we are entangled. Whose fault was it, dear? tangled up as the
grass patterns are tangled up in this coarse cloth, or as the little
Mushi that lives on and chirrups in dried sea-weed. We do not know where
are to-day our tears in the undergrowth of this eternal wilderness. We
neither wake nor sleep, and passing our nights in a sorrow which is in
the end a vision, what are these scenes of spring to us? This thinking in
sleep of someone who has no thought of you, is it more than a dream? and
yet surely it is the natural way of love. In our hearts there is much and
in our bodies nothing, and we do nothing at all, and only the waters of
the river of tears flow quickly.

CHORUS
Narrow is the cloth of Kefu, but wild is that river, that torrent of the
hills, between the beloved and the bride.

The cloth she had woven is faded, the thousand one hundred nights were
night-trysts watched out in vain.

WAKI (not recognizing the nature of the speakers)

  Strange indeed, seeing these town-people here.
  They seem like man and wife,
  And the lady seems to be holding something
  Like a cloth woven of feathers,
  While he has a staff or a wooden sceptre
  Beautifully ornate.
  Both of these things are strange;
  In any case, I wonder what they call them.

TSURE

  This is a narrow cloth called 'Hosonuno,'
  It is just the breadth of the loom.

SHITE

  And this is merely wood painted,
  And yet the place is famous because of these things.
  Would you care to buy them from us?

WAKI
Yes, I know that the cloth of this place and the lacquers are famous
things. I have already heard of their glory, and yet I still wonder why
they have such great reputation.

TSURE
Ah well now, that's a disappointment. Here they call the wood Nishikigi,'
and the woven stuff 'Hosonuno,' and yet you come saying that you have
never heard why, and never heard the story. Is it reasonable?

SHITE
No, no, that is reasonable enough. What can people be expected to know of
these affairs when it is more than they can do to keep abreast of their
own?

BOTH (to the Priest)
Ah well, you look like a person who has abandoned the world; it is
reasonable enough that you should not know the worth of wands and cloths
with love's signs painted upon them, with love's marks painted and dyed.

WAKI
That is a fine answer. And you would tell me then that Nishikigi and
Hosonuno are names bound over with love?

SHITE
They are names in love's list surely. Every day for a year, for three
years come to their full, the wands Nishikigi were set up, until there
were a thousand in all. And they are in song in your time, and will be.
'Chidzuka' they call them.

TSURE

  These names are surely a by-word.
  As the cloth Hosonuno is narrow of weft,
  More narrow than the breast,
  We call by this name any woman
  Whose breasts are hard to come nigh to.
  It is a name in books of love.

SHITE
'Tis a sad name to look back on.

TSURE

  A thousand wands were in vain.
  A sad name, set in a story.

SHITE

  A seed-pod void of the seed,
  We had no meeting together.

TSURE
Let him read out the story.

CHORUS

I
  At last they forget, they forget.
  The wands are no longer offered,
  The custom is faded away.
  The narrow cloth of Kefu
  Will not meet over the breast.
  'Tis the story of Hosonuno,
  This is the tale:
  These bodies, having no weft,
  Even now are not come together.
  Truly a shameful story,
  A tale to bring shame on the gods.

II
  Names of love,
  Now for a little spell,
  For a faint charm only,
  For a charm as slight as the binding together
  Of pine-flakes in Iwashiro,
  And for saying a wish over them about sunset,
  We return, and return to our lodging.
  The evening sun leaves a shadow.

WAKI
Go on, tell out all the story.

SHITE
There is an old custom of this country. We make wands of meditation, and
deck them with symbols, and set them before a gate, when we are suitors.

TSURE
And we women take up a wand of the man we would meet with, and let the
others lie, although a man might come for a hundred nights, it may be, or
for a thousand nights in three years, till there were a thousand wands
here in the shade of this mountain. We know the funeral cave of such a
man, one who had watched out the thousand nights; a bright cave, for they
buried him with all his wands. They have named it the 'Cave of the many
charms.'

WAKI

  I will go to that love-cave,
  It will be a tale to take back to my village.
  Will you show me my way there?

SHITE
So be it, I will teach you the path.

TSURE
Tell him to come over this way.

BOTH

  Here are the pair of them
  Going along before the traveller.

CHORUS

  We have spent the whole day until dusk
  Pushing aside the grass
  From the over-grown way at Kefu,
  And we are not yet come to the cave.
  O you there, cutting grass on the hill,
  Please set your mind on this matter.
  'You'd be asking where the dew is
  'While the frost's lying here on the road.
  'Who'd tell you that now?'
  Very well then don't tell us,
  But be sure we will come to the cave.

SHITE

  There's a cold feel in the autumn.
  Night comes....

CHORUS

  And storms; trees giving up their leaf,
  Spotted with sudden showers.
  Autumn! our feet are clogged
  In the dew-drenched, entangled leaves.
  The perpetual shadow is lonely,
  The mountain shadow is lying alone.
  The owl cries out from the ivies
  That drag their weight on the pine.
  Among the orchids and chrysanthemum flowers
  The hiding fox is now lord of that love-cave,
  Nishidzuka,
  That is dyed like the maple's leaf.
  They have left us this thing for a saying.
  That pair have gone into the cave.
(sign for the exit of Shite and Tsure)


Second Part

(The Waki has taken the posture of sleep. His respectful visit to the
cave is beginning to have its effect.)

WAKI (restless)

  It seems that I cannot sleep
  For the length of a pricket's horn.
  Under October wind, under pines, under night!
  I will do service to Butsu.
(he performs the gestures of a ritual)

TSURE

  Aie! honoured priest!
  You do not dip twice in the river
  Beneath the same tree's shadow
  Without bonds in some other life.
  Hear sooth-say,
  Now is there meeting between us,
  Between us who were until now
  In life and in after-life kept apart.
  A dream-bridge over wild grass,
  Over the grass I dwell in.
  O honoured! do not awake me by force.
  I see that the law is perfect.

SHITE (supposedly invisible)

  It is a good service you have done, sir,
  A service that spreads in two worlds,
  And binds up an ancient love
  That was stretched out between them.
  I had watched for a thousand days.
  Take my thanks,
  For this meeting is under a difficult law.
  And now I will show myself in the form of Nishikigi.
  I will come out now for the first time in colour.

(The characters announce or explain their acts, as these are mostly
symbolical. Thus here the Shite, or Sh'te, announces his change of
costume, and later the dance.)

CHORUS

  The three years are over and past:
  All that is but an old story.

SHITE

  To dream under dream we return.
  Three years.... And the meeting comes now!
  This night has happened over and over,
  And only now comes the tryst.

CHORUS

  Look there to the cave
  Beneath the stems of the Suzuki.
  From under the shadows of the love-grass,
  See, see how they come forth and appear
  For an instant.... Illusion!

SHITE

  There is at the root of hell
  No distinction between princes and commons;
  Wretched for me! 'tis the saying.

WAKI

  Strange, what seemed so very old a cave
  Is all glittering-bright within,
  Like the flicker of fire.
  It is like the inside of a house.
  They are setting up a loom,
  And heaping up charm-sticks. No,
  The hangings are out of old time.
  Is it illusion, illusion?

TSURE

  Our hearts have been in the dark of the falling snow,
  We have been astray in the flurry.
  You should tell better than we
  How much is illusion;
  You who are in the world.
  We have been in the whirl of those who are fading.

SHITE

  Indeed in old times Narihira said,
  --and he has vanished with the years--
  'Let a man who is in the world tell the fact.'
  It is for you, traveller,
  To say how much is illusion.

WAKI

  Let it be a dream, or a vision,
  Or what you will, I care not.
  Only show me the old times over-past and snowed under--
  Now, soon, while the night lasts.

SHITE

  Look then, the old times are shown,
  Faint as the shadow-flower shows in the grass that bears it;
  And you've but a moon for lanthorn.

TSURE

  The woman has gone into the cave.
  She sets up her loom there
  For the weaving of Hosonuno,
  Thin as the heart of Autumn.

SHITE

  The suitor for his part, holding his charm-sticks,
  Knocks on a gate which was barred.

TSURE

  In old time he got back no answer,
  No secret sound at all
  Save....

SHITE
The sound of the loom.

TSURE

  It was a sweet sound like katydids and crickets,
  A thin sound like the Autumn.

SHITE
It was what you would hear any night.

TSURE

  Kiri.

SHITE

    Hatari.

TSURE

      Cho.

SHITE

        Cho.

CHORUS (mimicking the sound of crickets)

  Kiri, hatari, cho, cho,
  Kiri, hatari, cho, cho.
  The cricket sews on at his old rags,
  With all the new grass in the field; sho,
  Churr, isho, like the whir of a loom: churr.

CHORUS (antistrophe)

  Let be, they make grass-cloth in Kefu,
  Kefu, the land's end, matchless in the world.

SHITE

  That is an old custom, truly,
  But this priest would look on the past.

CHORUS

  The good priest himself would say:
  Even if we weave the cloth, Hosonuno,
  And set up the charm-sticks
  For a thousand, a hundred nights,
  Even then our beautiful desire will not pass,
  Nor fade nor die out.

SHITE

  Even to-day the difficulty of our meeting is remembered,
  And is remembered in song.

CHORUS

  That we may acquire power,
  Even in our faint substance,
  We will show forth even now,
  And though it be but in a dream,
  Our form of repentance.
(explaining the movement of the Shite and Tsure)
  There he is carrying wands,
  And she has no need to be asked.
  See her within the cave,
  With a cricket-like noise of weaving.
  The grass-gates and the hedge are between them;
  That is a symbol.
  Night has already come on.
(now explaining the thoughts of the man's spirit)
  Love's thoughts are heaped high within him,
  As high as the charm-sticks,
  As high as the charm-sticks, once coloured,
  Now fading, lie heaped in this cave.
  And he knows of their fading. He says:
  I lie a body, unknown to any other man,
  Like old wood buried in moss.
  It were a fit thing
  That I should stop thinking the love-thoughts.
  The charm-sticks fade and decay,
  And yet,
  The rumour of our love
  Takes foot and moves through the world.
  We had no meeting
  But tears have, it seems, brought out a bright blossom
  Upon the dyed tree of love.

SHITE

  Tell me, could I have foreseen
  Or known what a heap of my writings
  Should lie at the end of her shaft-bench?

CHORUS

  A hundred nights and more
  Of twisting, encumbered sleep,
  And now they make it a ballad,
  Not for one year or for two only
  But until the days lie deep
  As the sand's depth at Kefu,
  Until the year's end is red with Autumn,
  Red like these love-wands,
  A thousand nights are in vain.
  And I stand at this gate-side.
  You grant no admission, you do not show yourself
  Until I and my sleeves are faded.
  By the dew-like gemming of tears upon my sleeve,
  Why will you grant no admission?
  And we all are doomed to pass,
  You, and my sleeves and my tears.
  And you did not even know when three years had come to an end.
  Cruel, ah cruel!
  The charm-sticks....

SHITE

  Were set up a thousand times;
  Then, now, and for always.

CHORUS
Shall I ever at last see into that room of hers, which no other sight has
traversed?

SHITE

  Happy at last and well-starred,
  Now comes the eve of betrothal:
  We meet for the wine-cup.

CHORUS

  How glorious the sleeves of the dance,
  That are like snow-whirls!

SHITE
Tread out the dance.

CHORUS

  Tread out the dance and bring music.
  This dance is for Nishikigi.

SHITE
 This dance is for the evening plays,
 And for the weaving.

CHORUS

  For the tokens between lover and lover:
  It is a reflecting in the wine-cup.

CHORUS

  Ari-aki,
  The dawn!
  Come, we are out of place;
  Let us go ere the light comes.
(to the Waki)
  We ask you, do not awake,
  We all will wither away,
  The wands and this cloth of a dream.
  Now you will come out of sleep,
  You tread the border and nothing
  Awaits you: no, all this will wither away.
  There is nothing here but this cave in the field's midst.
  To-day's wind moves in the pines;
  A wild place, unlit, and unfilled.
