                     THE WIDOWING OF MRS. HOLROYD


                            THE FIRST ACT

                               SCENE I

_The kitchen of a miner's small cottage. On the left is the fireplace,
with a deep, full red fire. At the back is a white-curtained window,
and beside it the outer door of the room. On the right, two white
wooden stairs intrude into the kitchen below the closed stair foot
door. On the left, another door._

_The room is furnished with a chintz-backed sofa under the window, a
glass-knobbed painted dresser on the right, and in the centre, toward
the fire, a table with a red and blue check tablecloth. On one side
of the hearth is a wooden rocking-chair, on the other an armchair of
round staves. An unlighted copper-shaded lamp hangs from the raftered
ceiling. It is dark twilight, with the room full of warm fireglow. A
woman enters from the outer door. As she leaves the door open behind
her, the colliery rail can be seen not far from the threshold, and,
away back, the headstocks of a pit._

_The woman is tall and voluptuously built. She carries a basket heaped
full of washing, which she has just taken from the clotheslines
outside. Setting down the basket heavily, she feels among the
clothes. She lifts out a white heap of sheets and other linen,
setting it on the table; then she takes a woollen shirt in her hand._

MRS. HOLROYD (_aloud, to herself_)

You know they're not dry even now, though it's been as fine as it has.
(_She spreads the shirt on the back of her rocking-chair, which she
turns to the fire_)

VOICE (_calling from outside_)

Well, have you got them dry?

[_Mrs. Holroyd starts up, turns and flings her hand in the direction
of the open door, where appears a man in blue overalls, swarfed and
greased. He carries a dinner-basket._

MRS. HOLROYD

You--you--I don't know what to call you! The idea of shouting at me
like that--like the Evil One out of the darkness!

BLACKMORE

I ought to have remembered your tender nerves. Shall I come in?

MRS. HOLROYD

No--not for your impudence. But you're late, aren't you?

BLACKMORE

It's only just gone six. We electricians, you know, we're the
gentlemen on a mine: ours is gentlemen's work. But I'll bet Charles
Holroyd was home before four.

MRS. HOLROYD (_bitterly_)

Ay, and gone again before five.

BLACKMORE

But mine's a lad's job, and I do nothing!--Where's he gone?

MRS. HOLROYD (_contemptuously_)

Dunno! He'd got a game on somewhere--toffed himself up to the nines,
and skedaddled off as brisk as a turkey-cock. (_She smirks in front
of the mirror hanging on the chimney-piece, in imitation of a man
brushing his hair and moustache and admiring himself_)

BLACKMORE

Though turkey-cocks aren't brisk as a rule. Children playing?

MRS. HOLROYD (_recovering herself, coldly_)

Yes. And they ought to be in. (_She continues placing the flannel
garments before the fire, on the fender and on chair-backs, till the
stove is hedged in with a steaming fence; then she takes a sheet in a
bundle from the table, and going up to Blackmore, who stands watching
her, says_) Here, take hold, and help me fold it.

BLACKMORE

I shall swarf it up.

MRS. HOLROYD (_snatching back the sheet_)

Oh, you're as tiresome as everybody else.

BLACKMORE (_putting down his basket and moving to door on
right_)

Well, I can soon wash my hands.

MRS. HOLROYD (_ceasing to flap and fold pillowcases_)

That roller-towel's ever so dirty. I'll get you another. (_She goes to
a drawer in the dresser, and then back toward the scullery, where is a
sound of water_)

BLACKMORE

Why, bless my life, I'm a lot dirtier than the towel. I don't want
another.

MRS. HOLROYD (_going into the scullery_)

Here you are.

BLACKMORE (_softly, now she is near him_)

Why did you trouble now? Pride, you know, pride, nothing else.

MRS. HOLROYD (_also playful_)

It's nothing but decency.

BLACKMORE (_softly_)

Pride, pride, pride!

[_A child of eight suddenly appears in the doorway._

JACK

Oo, how dark!

MRS. HOLROYD (_hurrying agitated into the kitchen_)

Why, where have you been--what have you been doing now?

JACK (SURPRISED)

Why--I've only been out to play.

MRS. HOLROYD (_still sharply_)

And where's Minnie?

[_A little girl of six appears by the door._

MINNIE

I'm here, mam, and what do you think--?

MRS. HOLROYD (_softening, as she recovers equanimity_)

Well, and what should I think?

JACK

Oh, yes, mam--you know my father--?

MRS. HOLROYD (_ironically_)

I should hope so.

MINNIE

We saw him dancing, mam, with a paper bonnet.

MRS. HOLROYD

What--?

JACK

There's some women at "New Inn," what's come from Nottingham--

MINNIE

An' he's dancin' with the pink one.

JACK

Shut up our Minnie. An' they've got paper bonnets on--

MINNIE

All colors, mam!

JACK (_getting angry_)

Shut up our Minnie! An' my dad's dancing with her.

MINNIE

With the pink-bonnet one, mam.

JACK

Up in the club-room over the bar.

MINNIE

An' she's a lot littler than him, mam.

JACK (_piteously_)

Shut up our Minnie--An' you can see 'em go past the window, 'cause
there isn't no curtains up, an' my father's got the pink bonnet one--

MINNIE

An' there's a piano, mam--

JACK

An' lots of folks outside watchin', lookin' at my dad! He can dance,
can't he, mam?

MRS. HOLROYD (_she has been lighting the lamp, and holds the
lamp-glass_)

And who else is there?

MINNIE

Some more men--an' _all_ the women with paper bonnets on.

JACK

There's about ten, I should think, an' they say they came in a brake
from Nottingham.

[_Mrs. Holroyd, trying to replace the lamp-glass over the flame, lets
it drop on the floor with a smash._

JACK

There, now--now we 'll have to have a candle.

BLACKMORE (_appearing in the scullery doorway with the
towel_) What's that--the lamp-glass?

JACK

I never knowed Mr. Blackmore was here.

BLACKMORE (_to Mrs. Holroyd_)

Have you got another?

MRS. HOLROYD

No. (_There is silence for a moment_) We can manage with a candle for
to-night.

BLACKMORE (_stepping forward and blowing out the smoky
flame_) I'll see if I can't get you one from the pit. I shan't be a
minute.

MRS. HOLROYD

Don't--don't bother--I don't want you to.

[_He, however, unscrews the burner and goes._

MINNIE

Did Mr. Blackmore come for tea, mam?

MRS. HOLROYD

No; he's had no tea.

JACK

I bet he's hungry. Can I have some bread?

MRS. HOLROYD (_she stands a lighted candle on the table_)
Yes, and you can get your boots off to go to bed.

JACK

It's not seven o'clock yet.

MRS. HOLROYD

It doesn't matter.

MINNIE

What do they wear paper bonnets for, mam?

MRS. HOLROYD

Because they're brazen hussies.

JACK

I saw them having a glass of beer.

MRS. HOLROYD

A nice crew!

JACK

They say they are old pals of Mrs. Meakins. You could hear her
screaming o' laughin', an' my dad says: "He-ah, missis--here--a
dog's-nose for the Dachess--hopin' it'll smell samthing"--What's a
dog's-nose?

MRS. HOLROYD (_giving him a piece of bread and butter_)

Don't ask me, child. How should I know?

MINNIE

Would she eat it, mam?

MRS. HOLROYD

Eat what?

MINNIE

Her in the pink bonnet--eat the dog's nose?

MRS. HOLROYD

No, of course not. How should I know what a dog's-nose is?

JACK

I bet he'll never go to work to-morrow, mother--will he?

MRS. HOLROYD

Goodness knows. I'm sick of it--disgracing me. There'll be the whole
place cackling _this_ now. They've no sooner finished about him
getting taken up for fighting than they begin on this. But I'll put
a stop to it some road or other. It's not going on, if I know it: it
isn't.

[_She stops, hearing footsteps, and Blackmore enters._

BLACKMORE

Here we are then--got one all right.

MINNIE

Did they give it you, Mr. Blackmore?

BLACKMORE

No, I took it.

[_He screws on the burner and proceeds to light the lamp. He is a
tall, slender, mobile man of twenty-seven, brown-haired, dressed in
blue overalls. Jack Holroyd is a big, dark, ruddy, lusty lad. Minnie
is also big, but fair._

MINNIE

What do you wear blue trousers for, Mr. Blackmore?

BLACKMORE

They're to keep my other trousers from getting greasy.

MINNIE

Why don't you wear pit-breeches, like dad's?

JACK

'Cause he's a 'lectrician. Could you make me a little injun what would
make electric light?

BLACKMORE

I will, some day.

JACK

When?

MINNIE

Why don't you come an' live here?

BLACKMORE (_looking swiftly at Mrs. Holroyd_)

Nay, you've got your own dad to live here.

MINNIE (_plaintively_)

Well, you could come as well. Dad shouts when we've gone to bed, an'
thumps the table. He wouldn't if you was here.

JACK

He dursn't--

MRS. HOLROYD

Be quiet now, be quiet. Here, Mr. Blackmore. (_She again gives him the
sheet to fold_)

BLACKMORE

Your hands _are_ cold.

MRS. HOLROYD

Are they?--I didn't know.

[_Blackmore puts his hand on hers._

MRS. HOLROYD (_confusedly, looking aside_)

You must want your tea.

BLACKMORE

I'm in no hurry.

MRS. HOLROYD

Selvidge to selvidge. You'll be quite a domestic man, if you go on.

BLACKMORE

Ay.

[_They fold the two sheets._

BLACKMORE

They are white, your sheets!

MRS. HOLROYD

But look at the smuts on them--look! This vile hole! I'd never have
come to live here, in all the thick of the pit-grime, and lonely, if
it hadn't been for him, so that he shouldn't call in a public-house on
his road home from work. And now he slinks past on the other side of
the railway, and goes down to the New Inn instead of coming in for his
dinner. I might as well have stopped in Bestwood.

BLACKMORE

Though I rather like this little place, standing by itself.

MRS. HOLROYD

Jack, can you go and take the stockings in for me? They're on the
line just below the pigsty. The prop's near the apple-tree--mind it.
Minnie, you take the peg-basket.

MINNIE

Will there be any rats, mam?

MRS. HOLROYD

Rats--no. They'll be frightened when they hear you, if there are.

[_The children go out._

BLACKMORE

Poor little beggars!

MRS. HOLROYD

Do you know, this place is fairly alive with rats. They run up
that dirty vine in front of the house--I'm always at him to cut it
down--and you can hear them at night overhead like a regiment of
soldiers tramping. Really, you know, I _hate_ them.

BLACKMORE

Well--a rat is a nasty thing!

MRS. HOLROYD

But I s'll get used to them. I'd give anything to be out of this place.

BLACKMORE

It _is_ rotten, when you're tied to a life you don't like. But I
should miss it if you weren't here. When I'm coming down the line to
the pit in the morning--it's nearly dark at seven now--I watch the
firelight in here--Sometimes I put my hand on the wall outside where
the chimney runs up to feel it warm--There isn't much in Bestwood, is
there?

MRS. HOLROYD

There's less than nothing if you can't be like the rest of them--as
common as they're 'made.

BLACKMORE

It's a fact--particularly for a woman--But this place is cosy--God
love me, I'm sick of lodgings.

MRS. HOLROYD

You'll have to get married--I'm sure there are plenty of nice girls
about.

BLACKMORE

Are there? I never see 'em. (_He laughs_)

MRS. HOLROYD

Oh, come, you can't say that.

BLACKMORE

I've not seen a single girl--an unmarried girl--that I should want for
more than a fortnight--not one.

MRS. HOLROYD

Perhaps you're very particular.

[_She puts her two palms on the table and leans back. He draws near to
her, dropping his head._

BLACKMORE

Look here!

[_He has put his hand on the table near hers._

MRS. HOLROYD

Yes, I know you've got nice hands--but you needn't be vain of them.

BLACKMORE

No--it's not that--But don't they seem--(_he glances swiftly at her;
she turns her head aside; he laughs nervously_)--they sort of go well
with one another. (_He laughs again_)

MRS. HOLROYD

They _do_, rather--

[_They stand still, near one another, with bent heads, for a moment.
Suddenly she starts up and draws her hand away._

BLACKMORE

Why--what is it?

[_She does not answer. The children come in--Jack with an armful of
stockings, Minnie with the basket of pegs._

JACK

I believe it's freezing, mother.

MINNIE

Mr. Blackmore, could you shoot a rat an' hit it?

BLACKMORE (_laughing_)

Shoot the lot of 'em, like a wink.

MRS. HOLROYD

But you've had no tea. What an awful shame to keep you here!

BLACKMORE

Nay, I don't care. It never bothers me.

MRS. HOLROYD

Then you're different from most men.

BLACKMORE

All men aren't alike, you know.

MRS. HOLROYD

But do go and get some tea.

MINNIE (_plaintively_)

Can't you stop, Mr. Blackmore?

BLACKMORE

Why, Minnie?

MINNIE

So's we're not frightened. Yes, do. Will you?

BLACKMORE

Frightened of what?

MINNIE

'Cause there's noises, an' rats,--an' perhaps dad'll come home and
shout.

BLACKMORE

But he'd shout more if I was here.

JACK

He doesn't when my uncle John's here. So you stop, an' perhaps he
won't.

BLACKMORE

Don't you like him to shout when you're in bed?

[_They do not answer, but look seriously at him._


CURTAIN


SCENE II

_The same scene, two hours later. The clothes are folded in little
piles on the table and the sofa. Mrs. Holroyd is folding a thick
flannel undervest or singlet which her husband wears in the pit and
which has just dried on the fender._

MRS. HOLROYD (_to herself_)

Now thank goodness they're all dried. It's only nine o'clock, so he
won't be in for another two hours, the nuisance. (_She sits on the
sofa, letting her arms hang down in dejection. After a minute or two
she jumps up, to begin rudely dropping the piles of washed clothes in
the basket_) I don't care, I'm not going to let him have it all _his_
way--no! (_She weeps a little, fiercely, drying her eyes on the edge
of her white apron_) Why should _I_ put up with it all?--_He_ can do
what he likes. But I don't care, no, I don't--

[_She flings down the full clothes-basket, sits suddenly in the
rocking-chair, and weeps. There is the sound of coarse, bursting
laughter, in vain subdued, and a man's deep guffaws. Footsteps draw
near. Suddenly the door opens, and a little, plump, pretty woman of
thirty, in a close-fitting dress and a giddy, frilled bonnet of pink
paper, stands perkily in the doorway. Mrs. Holroyd springs up: her
small, sensitive nose is inflamed with weeping, her eyes are wet and
flashing. She fronts the other woman._

CLARA (_with a pert smile and a jerk of the head_)

Good evenin'!

MRS. HOLROYD

What do you want?

CLARA (_she has a Yorkshire accent_)

Oh, we've not come beggin'--this is a visit.

[_She stuffs her handkerchief in front of her mouth in a little
snorting burst of laughter. There is the sound of another woman behind
going off into uncontrollable laughter, while a man guffaws._

MRS. HOLROYD (_after a moment of impotence--tragically_)

What--!

CLARA (_faltering slightly, affecting a polite tone_)

We thought we'd just call--

[_She stuffs her handkerchief in front of her explosive laughter--the
other woman shrieks again, beginning high, and running down the scale._

MRS. HOLROYD

What do you mean?--What do you want here?

CLARA (_she bites her lip_)

We don't want anything, thanks. We've just called. (_She begins to
laugh again--so does the other_) Well, I don't think much of the
manners in this part of the country. (_She takes a few hesitating
steps into the kitchen_)

MRS. HOLROYD (_trying to shut the door upon her_)

No, you are not coming in.

CLARA (_preventing her closing the door_)

Dear me, what a to-do! (_She struggles with the door. The other woman
comes up to help; a man is seen in the background_)

LAURA

My word, aren't we good enough to come in?

[_Mrs. Holroyd, finding herself confronted by what seems to her
excitement a crowd, releases the door and draws back a little--almost
in tears of anger._

MRS. HOLROYD

You have no business here. What do you want?

CLARA (_putting her bonnet straight and entering in brisk
defiance_) I tell you we've only come to see you. (_She looks round
the kitchen, then makes a gesture toward the armchair_) Can I sit
here? (_She plumps herself down_) Rest for the weary.

[_A woman and a man have followed her into the room. Laura is highly
colored, stout, some forty years old, wears a blue paper bonnet, and
looks like the landlady of a public-house. Both she and Clara wear
much jewellery. Laura is well dressed in a blue cloth dress. Holroyd
is a big blond man. His cap is pushed back, and he looks rather tipsy
and lawless. He has a heavy blond moustache. His jacket and trousers
are black, his vest gray, and he wears a turn down collar with dark
bow._

LAURA (_sitting down in a chair on right, her hand on her
bosom, panting_) I've laughed till I feel fair bad.

CLARA

'Aven't you got a drop of nothink to offer us, mester? Come, you are
slow. I should 'ave thought a gentleman like you would have been out
with the glasses afore we could have got breaths to ask you.

HOLROYD (_clumsily_)

I dunna believe there's owt in th' 'ouse but a bottle of stout.

CLARA (_putting her hand on her stomach_)

It feels as if th' kettle's going to boil over.

[_She stuffs her handkerchief in front of her mouth, throws back her
head, and snorts with laughter, having now regained her confidence.
Laura laughs in the last state of exhaustion, her hand on her breast._

HOLROYD

Shall ta ha'e it then?

CLARA

What do you say, Laura--are you having a drop?

LAURA (_submissively, and naturally tongue-tied_)

Well--I don't mind--I will if _you_ do.

CLARA (_recklessly_)

I think we'll 'ave a drop, Charlie, an' risk it. It'll 'appen hold the
rest down.

[_There is a moment of silence, while Holroyd goes into the scullery.
Clara surveys the room and the dramatic pose of Mrs. Holroyd
curiously._

HOLROYD (_suddenly_)

Heh! What, come 'ere--!

[_There is a smash of pots, and a rat careers out of the scullery.
Laura, the first to see it, utters a scream, but is fastened to her
chair, unable to move._

CLARA (_jumps up to the table, crying_)

It's a rat--Oh, save us! (_She scrambles up, banging her head on the
lamp, which swings violently_)

MRS. HOLROYD (_who, with a little shriek, jerks her legs
up on to the sofa, where she was stiffly reclining, now cries in
despairing falsetto, stretching forth her arms_) The lamp--mind, the
lamp!

[_Clara steadies the lamp, and holds her hand to her head._

HOLROYD (_coming from the scullery, a bottle of stout in his
hand_) Where is he?

CLARA

I believe he's gone under the sofa. My, an' he's a thumper, if you
like, as big as a rabbit.

[_Holroyd advances cautiously toward the sofa._

LAURA (_springing suddenly into life_)

Hi, hi, let me go--let me go--Don't touch him--Where is he? (_She
flees and scrambles onto Clara's armchair, catching hold of the
latter's skirts_)

CLARA

Hang off--do you want to have a body down--Mind, I tell you.

MRS. HOLROYD (_bunched up on the sofa, with crossed hands
holding her arms, fascinated, watches her husband as he approaches to
stoop and attack the rat; she suddenly screams_) Don't, he'll fly at
you!

HOLROYD

He'll not get a chance.

MRS. HOLROYD

He will, he will--and they're poisonous! (_She ends on a very high
note. Leaning forward on the sofa as far as she dares, she stretches
out her arms to keep back her husband, who is about to kneel and
search under the sofa for the rat_)

HOLROYD

Come off, I canna see him.

MRS. HOLROYD

I won't let you; he'll fly at you.

HOLROYD

I'll settle him--

MRS. HOLROYD

Open the door and let him go.

HOLROYD

I shonna. I'll settle him. Shut thy claver. He'll non come anigh thee.

[_He kneels down and begins to creep to the sofa. With a great bound,
Mrs. Holroyd flies to the door and flings it open. Then she rushes
back to the couch._

CLARA

There he goes!

HOLROYD (_simultaneously_)

Hi!--Ussza! (_He flings the bottle of stout out of the door_)

LAURA (_piteously_)

Shut the door, do.

[_Holroyd rises, dusting his trousers' knees, and closes the door.
Laura heavily descends and drops in the chair._

CLARA

Here, come an' help us down, Charlie. Look at her; she's going off.
(_Though Laura is still purple red, she sinks back in the chair.
Holroyd goes to the table. Clara places her hands on his shoulders
and jumps lightly down. Then she pushes Holroyd with her elbow_) Look
sharp, get a glass of water.

[_She unfastens Laura's collar and pulls off the paper bonnet. Mrs.
Holroyd sits up, straightens her clothing, and tries to look cold
and contemptuous. Holroyd brings a cup of water. Clara sprinkles her
friend's face. Laura sighs and sighs again very deeply, then draws
herself up painfully._

CLARA (_tenderly_)

Do you feel any better--shall you have a drink of water? (_Laura
mournfully shakes her head; Clara turns sharply to Holroyd_) She'll
'ave a drop o' something. (_Holroyd goes out. Clara meanwhile fans
her friend with a handkerchief. Holroyd brings stout. She pours out
the stout, smells the glass, smells the bottle--then finally the
cork_) Eh, mester, it's all of a work--it's had a foisty cork.

[_At that instant the stair foot door opens slowly, revealing the
children--the girl peering over the boy's shoulder--both in white
nightgowns. Everybody starts. Laura gives a little cry, presses her
hand on her bosom, and sinks back, gasping._

CLARA (_appealing and anxious, to Mrs. Holroyd_)

You don't 'appen to 'ave a drop of brandy for her, do you, missis?

[_Mrs. Holroyd rises coldly without replying, and goes to the stair
foot door where the children stand._

MRS. HOLROYD (_sternly, to the children_)

Go to bed!

JACK

What's a matter, mother?

MRS. HOLROYD

Never you mind, go to bed!

CLARA (_appealingly_)

Be quick, missis.

[_Mrs. Holroyd, glancing round, sees Laura going purple, and runs past
the children upstairs. The boy and girl sit on the lowest stair. Their
father goes out of the house, shamefaced. Mrs. Holroyd runs downstairs
with a little brandy in a large bottle._

CLARA

Thanks, awfully. (_To Laura_) Come on, try an' drink a drop, there's a
dear.

[_They administer brandy to Laura. The children sit watching,
open-eyed. The girl stands up to look._

MINNIE (_whispering_)

I believe it's blue bonnet.

JACK (_whispering_)

It isn't--she's in a fit.

MINNIE (_whispering_)

Well, look under th' table--(_Jack peers under_)--there's 'er bonnet.
(_Jack creeps forward_) Come back, our Jack.

JACK (_returns with the bonnet_)

It's all made of paper.

MINNIE

Let's have a look--it's stuck together, not sewed.

[_She tries it on. Holroyd enters--he looks at the child._

MRS. HOLROYD (_sharply, glancing round_)

Take that off!

[_Minnie hurriedly takes the bonnet from her head. Her father snatches
it from her and puts it on the fire._

CLARA

There, you're coming round now, love.

[_Mrs. Holroyd turns away. She sees Holroyd's eyes on the
brandy-bottle, and immediately removes it, corking it up._

MRS. HOLROYD (_to Clara_)

You will not need this any more?

CLARA

No, thanks. I'm very much obliged.

MRS. HOLROYD (_does not unbend, but speaks coldly to the
children_) Come, this is no place for you--come back to bed.

MINNIE

No, mam, I don't want to.

MRS. HOLROYD (_contralto_)

Come along!

MINNIE

I'm frightened, mam.

MRS. HOLROYD

Frightened, what of?

MINNIE

Oo, there _was_ a row.

MRS. HOLROYD (_taking Minnie in her arms_)

Did they frighten you, my pet? (_She kisses her_)

JACK (_in a high whisper_)

Mother, it's pink bonnet and blue bonnet, what was dancing.

MINNIE (_whimpering_)

I don't want to go to bed, mam, I'm frightened.

CLARA (_who has pulled off her pink bonnet and revealed a
jug-handle coiffure_) We're going now, duckie--you're not frightened
of us, are you?

[_Mrs. Holroyd takes the girl away before she can answer. Jack lingers
behind._

HOLROYD

Now then, get off after your mother.

JACK (_taking no notice of his father_)

I say, what's a dog's-nose?

[_Clara ups with her handkerchief and Laura responds with a faint
giggle._

HOLROYD

Go thy ways upstairs.

CLARA

It's only a small whiskey with a spoonful of beer in it, my duck.

JACK

Oh!

CLARA

Come here, my duck, come on.

[_Jack, curious, advances._

CLARA

You'll tell your mother we didn't mean no harm, won't you?

JACK (_touching her earrings_)

What are they made of?

CLARA

They're only earrings. Don't you like them?

JACK

Um! (_He stands surveying her curiously. Then he touches a bracelet
made of many little mosaic brooches_) This is pretty, isn't it?

CLARA (_pleased_)

Do you like it?

[_She takes it off. Suddenly Mrs. Holroyd is heard calling, "Jack,
Jack!" Clara starts._

HOLROYD

Now then, get off!

CLARA (_as Jack is reluctantly going_)

Kiss me good-night, duckie, an' give this to your sister, shall you?

[_She hands Jack the mosaic bracelet. He takes it doubtfully. She
kisses him. Holroyd watches in silence._

LAURA (_suddenly, pathetically_)

Aren't you going to give me a kiss, an' all?

[_Jack yields her his cheek, then goes._

CLARA (_to Holroyd_)

Aren't they nice children?

HOLROYD

Ay.

CLARA (_briskly_)

Oh, dear, you're very short, all of a sudden. Don't answer if it hurts
you.

LAURA

My, isn't he different?

HOLROYD (_laughing forcedly_)

I'm no different.

CLARA

Yes, you are. You shouldn't 'ave brought us if you was going to turn
funny over it.

HOLROYD

I'm not funny.

CLARA

No, you're not. (_She begins to laugh. Laura joins in in spite of
herself_) You're about as solemn as a roast potato. (_She flings up
her hands, claps them down on her knees, and sways up and down as she
laughs, Laura joining in, hand on breast_) Are you ready to be mashed?
(_She goes off again--then suddenly wipes the laughter off her mouth
and is solemn_) But look 'ere, this'll never do. Now I'm going to be
quiet. (_She prims herself_)

HOLROYD

Tha'd 'appen better.

CLARA

Oh, indeed! You think I've got to pull a mug to look decent? You'd
have to pull a big un, at that rate.

[_She bubbles off, uncontrollably--shaking herself in exasperation
meanwhile. Laura joins in. Holroyd leans over close to her._

HOLROYD

Tha's got plenty o' fizz in thee, seemly.

CLARA (_putting her hand on his face and pushing it aside,
but leaving her hand over his cheek and mouth like a caress_) Don't,
you've been drinking. (_She begins to laugh_)

HOLROYD

Should we be goin' then?

CLARA

Where do you want to take us?

HOLROYD

Oh--you please yourself o' that! Come on wi' me.

CLARA (_sitting up prim_)

Oh, indeed!

HOLROYD (_catching hold of her_)

Come on, let's be movin'--(_he glances apprehensively at the stairs_)

CLARA

What's your hurry?

HOLROYD (_persuasively_)

Yi, come on wi' thee.

CLARA

I don't think. (_She goes off, uncontrollably_)

HOLROYD (_sitting on the table, just above her_)

What's use o' sittin' 'ere?

CLARA

I'm very comfy: I thank thee.

HOLROYD

Tha 'rt a baffling little 'ussy.

CLARA (_running her hand along his thigh_)

Aren't you havin' nothing, my dear? (_Offers him her glass_)

HOLROYD (_getting down from the table and putting his hand
forcibly on her shoulder_) No. Come on, let's shift.

CLARA (_struggling_)

Hands off!

[_She fetches him a sharp slap across the face. Mrs. Holroyd is heard
coming downstairs. Clara, released, sits down, smoothing herself.
Holroyd looks evil. He goes out to the door._

CLARA (_to Mrs. Holroyd, penitently_)

I don't know what you think of us, I'm sure.

MRS. HOLROYD

I think nothing at all.

CLARA (_bubbling_)

So you fix your thoughts elsewhere, do you? (_Suddenly changing to
seriousness_) No, but I _have_ been awful to-night.

MRS. HOLROYD (_contralto, emphatic_)

I don't want to know anything about you. I shall be glad when you'll
go.

CLARA

Turning-out time, Laura.

LAURA (_turtling_)

I'm sorry, I'm sure.

CLARA

Never mind. But as true as I'm here, missis, I should never ha' come
if I'd thought. But I had a drop--it all started with your husband
sayin' he wasn't a married man.

LAURA (_laughing and wiping her eyes_)

I've never knowed her to go off like it--it's after the time she's had.

CLARA

You know, my husband was a brute to me--an' I was in bed three month
after he died. He was a brute, he was. This is the first time I've
been out; it's a'most the first laugh I've had for a year.

LAURA

It's true, what she says. We thought she'd go out of 'er mind. She
never spoke a word for a fortnight.

CLARA

Though he's only been dead for two months, he was a brute to me. I was
as nice a young girl as you could wish when I married him and went to
the Fleece Inn--I was.

LAURA

Killed hisself drinking. An' she's that excitable, she is. We s'll
'ave an awful time with 'er to-morrow, I know.

MRS. HOLROYD (_coldly_)

I don't know why I should hear all this.

CLARA

I know I must 'ave seemed awful. An' them children--aren't they nice
little things, Laura?

LAURA

They are that.

HOLROYD (_entering from the door_)

Hanna you about done theer?

CLARA

My word, if this is the way you treat a lady when she comes to see
you. (_She rises_)

HOLROYD

I'll see you down th' line.

CLARA

You're not coming a stride with us.

LAURA

We've got no hat, neither of us.

CLARA

We've got our own hair on our heads, at any rate. (_Drawing herself
up suddenly in front of Mrs. Holroyd_) An' I've been educated at a
boarding school as good as anybody. I can behave myself either in the
drawing-room or in the kitchen as is fitting and proper. But if you'd
buried a husband like mine, you wouldn't feel you'd much left to be
proud of--an' you might go off occasionally.

MRS. HOLROYD

I don't want to hear you.

CLARA (_bobbing a curtsy_)

Sorry I spoke.

[_She goes out stiffly, followed by Laura._

HOLROYD (_going forward_)

You mun mind th' points down th' line.

CLARA'S VOICE

I thank thee, Charlie--mind thy own points.

[_He hesitates at the door--returns and sits down. There is silence
in the room. Holroyd sits with his chin in his hand. Mrs. Holroyd
listens. The footsteps and voices of the two women die out. Then she
closes the door. Holroyd begins to unlace his boots._

HOLROYD (_ashamed yet defiant, withal anxious to apologize_)
Wheer's my slippers?

[_Mrs. Holroyd sits on the sofa with face averted and does not answer._

HOLROYD

Dost hear? (_He pulls off his boots, noisily, and begins to hunt under
the sofa_) I canna find the things. (_No answer_) Humph!--then I'll
do be 'out 'em. (_He stumps about in his stocking feet; going into
the scullery, he brings out the loaf of bread; he returns into the
scullery_) Wheer's th' cheese? (_No answer--suddenly_) God blast it!
(_He hobbles into the kitchen_) I've trod on that brokken basin, an'
cut my foot open. (_Mrs. Holroyd refuses to take any notice. He sits
down and looks at his sole--pulls off his stocking and looks again_)
It's lamed me for life. (_Mrs. Holroyd glances at the wound_) Are 'na
ter goin' ter get me öwt for it?

MRS. HOLROYD

Psh!

HOLROYD

Oh, a' right then. (_He hops to the dresser, opens a drawer, and pulls
out a white rag; he is about to tear it_)

MRS. HOLROYD (_snatching it from him_)

Don't tear that!

HOLROYD (_shouting_)

Then what the deuce am I to do? (_Mrs. Holroyd sits stonily_) Oh, a'
right then! (_He hops back to his chair, sits down, and begins to pull
on his stocking_) A' right then--a' right then. (_In a fever of rage
he begins pulling on his boots_) I'll go where I _can_ find a bit o'
rag.

MRS. HOLROYD

Yes, that's what you want! All you want is an excuse to be off
again--"a bit of rag"!

HOLROYD (_shouting_)

An' what man'd want to stop in wi' a woman sittin' as fow as a
jackass, an' canna get a word from 'er edgeways.

MRS. HOLROYD

Don't expect me to speak to you after to-night's show. How dare you
bring them to my house, how dare you?

HOLROYD

They've non hurt your house, have they?

MRS. HOLROYD

I wonder you dare to cross the doorstep.

HOLROYD

I s'll do what the deuce I like. They're as good as you are.

MRS. HOLROYD (_stands speechless, staring at him; then low_)
Don't you come near me again--

HOLROYD (_suddenly shouting, to get his courage up_)

She's as good as you are, every bit of it.

MRS. HOLROYD (_blazing_)

Whatever I was and whatever I may be, don't you ever come near me
again.

HOLROYD

What! I'll show thee. What's the hurt to you if a woman comes to the
house? They're women as good as yourself, every whit of it.

MRS. HOLROYD

Say no more. _Go_ with them then, and don't come back.

HOLROYD

What! Yi, I will go, an' you s'll see. What! You think you're
something, since your uncle left you that money, an' Blackymore
puttin' you up to it. I can see your little game. I'm not as daft as
you imagine. I'm no fool, I tell you.

MRS. HOLROYD

No, you're not. You're a drunken beast, that's all you are.

HOLROYD

What, what--I'm what? I'll show you who's gaffer, though. (_He
threatens her_)

MRS. HOLROYD (_between her teeth_)

No, it's not going on. If _you_ won't go, I will.

HOLROYD

Go then, for you've always been too big for your shoes, in my house--

MRS. HOLROYD

Yes--I ought never to have looked at you. Only you showed a fair face
then.

HOLROYD

What! What! We'll see who's master i' this house. I tell you, I'm
goin' to put a stop to it. (_He brings his fist dawn on the table with
a bang_) It's going to stop. (_He bangs the table again_) I've put up
with it long enough. Do you think I'm a dog in the house, an' not a
man, do you--

MRS. HOLROYD

A dog would be better.

HOLROYD

Oh! Oh! Then we'll see. We'll see who's the dog and who isna. We're
goin' to see. (_He bangs the table_)

MRS. HOLROYD

Stop thumping that table! You've wakened those children once, you and
your trollops.

HOLROYD

I shall do what the deuce I like!

MRS. HOLROYD

No more, you won't, no more. I've stood this long enough. Now I'm
going. As for you--you've got a red face where she slapped you. Now
go to her.

HOLROYD

What? What?

MRS. HOLROYD

For I'm sick of the sights and sounds of you.

HOLROYD (_bitterly_)

By God, an' I've known it a long time.

MRS. HOLROYD

You have, and it's true.

HOLROYD

An' I know who it is th'rt hankerin' after.

MRS. HOLROYD

I only want to be rid of you.

HOLROYD

I know it mighty well. But _I_ know him!

[_Mrs. Holroyd, sinking down on the sofa, suddenly begins to sob
half-hysterically. Holroyd watches her. As suddenly, she dries her
eyes._

MRS. HOLROYD

Do you think I care about what you say? (_Suddenly_) Oh, I've had
enough. I've tried, I've tried for years, for the children's sakes.
Now I've had enough of your shame and disgrace.

HOLROYD

Oh, indeed!

MRS. HOLROYD (_her voice is dull and inflexible_)

I've had enough. Go out again after those trollops--leave me alone.
I've had enough. (_Holroyd stands looking at her_) Go, I mean it,
go out again. And if you never come back again, I'm glad. I've had
enough. (_She keeps her face averted, will not look at him, her
attitude expressing thorough weariness_)

HOLROYD

All right then!

[_He hobbles, in unlaced boots, to the door. Then he turns to look at
her. She turns herself still farther away, so that her back is toward
him. He goes._


CURTAIN


THE SECOND ACT


_The scene is the same, two hours later. The cottage is in darkness,
save for the firelight. On the table is spread a newspaper. A cup
and saucer, a plate, a piece of bacon in the frying tin are on the
newspaper ready for the miner's breakfast. Mrs. Holroyd has gone to
bed. There is a noise of heavy stumbling down the three steps outside._

BLACKMORE'S VOICE

Steady, now, steady. It's all in darkness. Missis!--Has she gone to
bed?

[_He tries the latch--shakes the door._

HOLROYD'S VOICE (_he is drunk_)

Her's locked me out. Let me smash that bloody door in. Come out--come
out--ussza! (_He strikes a heavy blow on the door. There is a scuffle_)

BLACKMORE'S VOICE

Hold on a bit--what're you doing?

HOLROYD'S VOICE

I'm smashing that blasted door in.

MRS. HOLROYD (_appearing and suddenly drawing the bolts,
flinging the door open_) What do you think you're doing?

HOLROYD (_lurching into the room, snarling_)

What? What? Tha thought tha'd play thy monkey tricks on me, did
ter? (_Shouting_) But I'm going to show thee. (_He lurches at her
threateningly; she recoils_)

BLACKMORE (_seizing him by the arm_)

Here, here,--! Come and sit down and be quiet.

HOLROYD (_snarling at him_)

What?--What? An' what's thäigh got ter do wi' it? (_Shouting_) What's
thäigh got ter do wi' it?

BLACKMORE

Nothing--nothing; but it's getting late, and you want your supper.

HOLROYD (_shouting_)

I want nöwt. I'm allowed nöwt in this 'ouse. (_Shouting louder_) 'Er
begrudges me ivry morsel I ha'e.

MRS. HOLROYD

Oh, what a story!

HOLROYD (_shouting_)

It's the truth, an' you know it.

BLACKMORE (_conciliatory_)

You'll rouse the children. You'll rouse the children, at this hour.

HOLROYD (_suddenly quiet_)

Not me--not if I know it. _I_ shan't disturb 'em--bless 'em.

[_He staggers to his armchair and sits heavily._

BLACKMORE

Shall I light the lamp?

MRS. HOLROYD

No, don't trouble. Don't stay any longer, there's no need.

BLACKMORE (_quietly_)

I'll just see it's all right.

[_He proceeds in silence to light the lamp. Holroyd is seen dropping
forward in his chair. He has a cut on his cheek. Mrs. Holroyd is in
an old-fashioned dressing-gown. Blackmore has an overcoat buttoned up
to his chin. There is a very large lump of coal on the red fire._

MRS. HOLROYD

Don't stay any longer.

BLACKMORE

I'll see it's all right.

MRS. HOLROYD

I shall be all right. He'll go to sleep now.

BLACKMORE

But he can't go like that.

MRS. HOLROYD

What has he done to his face?

BLACKMORE

He had a row with Jim Goodwin.

MRS. HOLROYD

What about?

BLACKMORE

I don't know.

MRS. HOLROYD

The beast!

BLACKMORE

By Jove, and isn't he a weight! He's getting fat, must be--

MRS. HOLROYD

He's big made--he has a big frame.

BLACKMORE

Whatever he is, it took me all my time to get him home. I thought I'd
better keep an eye on him. I knew you'd be worrying. So I sat in the
smoke room and waited for him. Though it's a dirty hole--and dull as
hell.

MRS. HOLROYD

Why did you bother?

BLACKMORE

Well, I thought you'd be upset about him. I had to drink three
whiskies--had to, in all conscience--(_smiling_)

MRS. HOLROYD

I don't want to be the ruin of you.

BLACKMORE (_smiling_)

Don't you? I thought he'd pitch forward onto the lines and crack his
skull.

[_Holroyd has been sinking farther and farther forward in drunken
sleep. He suddenly jerks too far and is awakened. He sits upright,
glaring fiercely and dazedly at the two, who instantly cease talking._

HOLROYD (_to Blackmore_)

What are thäigh doin' 'ere?

BLACKMORE

Why, I came along with you.

HOLROYD

Thou'rt a liar, I'm only just come in.

MRS. HOLROYD (_coldly_)

He is no liar at all. He brought you home because you were too drunk
to come yourself.

HOLROYD (_starting up_)

Thou'rt a liar! I niver set eyes on him this night, afore now.

MRS. HOLROYD (_with a "Pf" of contempt_)

You don't know what you _have_ done to-night.

HOLROYD (_shouting_)

I s'll not have it, I tell thee.

MRS. HOLROYD

Psh!

HOLROYD

I s'll not ha'e it. I s'll ha'e no carryin's on i' my 'ouse--

MRS. HOLROYD (_shrugging her shoulders_)

Talk when you've got some sense.

HOLROYD (_fiercely_)

I've as much sense as thäigh. Am I a fool? Canna I see? What's _he_
doin' here then, answer me that. What--?

MRS. HOLROYD

Mr. Blackmore came to bring _you_ home, because you were _too drunk_
to find your own way. And this is the thanks he gets.

HOLROYD (_contemptuously_)

Blackymore, Blackymore. It's him tha cuts thy cloth by, is it?

MRS. HOLROYD (_hotly_)

You don't know what you're talking about, so keep your tongue still.

HOLROYD (_bitingly_)

I don't know what I'm talking about--I don't know what I'm talking
about--don't I? An' what about him standing there then, if I don't
know what I'm talking about?--What?

BLACKMORE

You've been to sleep, Charlie, an' forgotten I came in with you, not
long since.

HOLROYD

I'm not daft, I'm not a fool. I've got eyes in my head, and sense. You
needn't try to get over me. I know what you're up to.

BLACKMORE (_flushing_)

It's a bit off to talk to me like that, Charlie, I must say.

HOLROYD

I'm not good enough for 'er. She wants Mr. Blackymore. He's a
gentleman, he is. Now we have it all; now we understand.

MRS. HOLROYD

I wish you understood enough to keep your tongue still.

HOLROYD

What? What? I'm to keep my tongue still, am I? An' what about _Mr.
Blackymore_?

MRS. HOLROYD (_fiercely_)

Stop your mouth, you--you vulgar, low-minded brute.

HOLROYD

Am I? Am I? An' what are you? What tricks are you up to, an' all? But
that's all right--that's all right. (_Shouting_) That's all right, if
it's _you_.

BLACKMORE

I think I'd better go. You seem to enjoy--er--er--calumniating your
wife.

HOLROYD (_mockingly_)

Calamniating--calamniating--I'll give you calamniating, you
mealy-mouthed jockey: I'll give you calamniating.

BLACKMORE

I think you've said about enough.

HOLROYD

'Ave I, 'ave I? Yer flimsy jack--'ave I? (_In a sudden burst_) But
I've not done wi' thee yet.

BLACKMORE (_ironically_)

No, and you haven't.

HOLROYD (_shouting--pulling himself up from the armchair_)
I'll show thee--I'll show thee.

[_Blackmore laughs._

HOLROYD

Yes!--yes, my young monkey. It's thäigh, is it?

BLACKMORE

Yes, it's _me_.

HOLROYD (_shouting_)

An' I'll ma'e thee wish it worn't, I will. What--? What--? Tha'd come
slivin' round here, would ta? (_He lurches forward at Blackmore with
clenched fist_)

MRS. HOLROYD

Drunken, drunken fool--oh, don't.

HOLROYD (_turning to her_)

What?

[_She puts up her hands before her face. Blackmore seizes the upraised
arm and swings Holroyd round._

BLACKMORE (_in a towering passion_)

Mind what tha'rt doing!

HOLROYD (_turning fiercely on him--incoherent_)

Wha'--wha'--!

[_He aims a heavy blow. Blackmore evades it, so that he is struck on
the side of the chest. Suddenly he shows his teeth. He raises his
fists ready to strike Holroyd when the latter stands to advantage._

MRS. HOLROYD (_rushing upon Blackmore_)

No, no! Oh, no!

[_She flies and opens the door, and goes out. Blackmore glances after
her, then at Holroyd, who is preparing, like a bull, for another
charge. The young man's face lights up._

HOLROYD

Wha'--wha'--!

[_As he advances, Blackmore quickly retreats out-of-doors. Holroyd
plunges upon him. Blackmore slips behind the door-jamb, puts out his
foot, and trips Holroyd with a crash upon the brick yard._

MRS. HOLROYD

Oh, what has he done to himself?

BLACKMORE (_thickly_)

Tumbled over himself.

[_Holroyd is seen struggling to rise, and is heard incoherently
cursing._

MRS. HOLROYD

Aren't you going to get him up?

BLACKMORE

What for?

MRS. HOLROYD

But what shall we do?

BLACKMORE

Let him go to hell.

[_Holroyd, who had subsided, begins to snarl and struggle again._

MRS. HOLROYD (_in terror_)

He's getting up.

BLACKMORE

All right, let him.

[_Mrs. Holroyd looks at Blackmore, suddenly afraid of him also._

HOLROYD (_in a last frenzy_)

I'll show thee--I'll--

[_He raises himself up, and is just picking his balance when
Blackmore, with a sudden light kick, sends him sprawling again. He is
seen on the edge of the light to collapse into stupor._

MRS. HOLROYD

He'll kill you, he'll kill you!

[_Blackmore laughs short._

MRS. HOLROYD

Would you believe it! Oh, isn't it awful! (_She begins to weep in
a little hysteria; Blackmore stands with his back leaning on the
doorway, grinning in a strained fashion_) Is he hurt, do you think?

BLACKMORE

I don't know--I should think not.

MRS. HOLROYD

I wish he was dead; I do, with all my heart.

BLACKMORE

Do you? (_He looks at her quickly; she wavers and shrinks; he begins
to smile strainedly as before_) You don't know _what_ you wish, or
what you want.

MRS. HOLROYD (_troubled_)

Do you think I could get past him to come inside?

BLACKMORE

I should think so.

[_Mrs. Holroyd, silent and troubled, manœuvres in the doorway,
stepping over her husband's feet, which lie on the threshold._

BLACKMORE

Why, you've got no shoes and stockings on!

MRS. HOLROYD

No. (_She enters the house and stands trembling before the fire_)

BLACKMORE (_following her_)

Are you cold?

MRS. HOLROYD

A little--with standing on the yard.

BLACKMORE

What a shame!

[_She, uncertain of herself, sits down. He drops on one knee,
awkwardly, and takes her feet in his hands._

MRS. HOLROYD

Don't--no, don't!

BLACKMORE

They are frightfully cold. (_He remains, with head sunk, for some
moments, then slowly rises_) Damn him!

[_They look at each other; then, at the same time, turn away._

MRS. HOLROYD

We can't leave him lying there.

BLACKMORE

No--no! I'll bring him in.

MRS. HOLROYD

But--!

BLACKMORE

He won't wake again. The drink will have got hold of him by now. (_He
hesitates_) Could you take hold of his feet--he's so heavy.

MRS. HOLROYD

Yes.

[_They go out and are seen stooping over Holroyd._

BLACKMORE

Wait, wait, till I've got him--half a minute.

[_Mrs. Holroyd backs in first. They carry Holroyd in and lay him on
the sofa._

MRS. HOLROYD

Doesn't he look awful?

BLACKMORE

It's more mark than mar. It isn't much, really.

[_He is busy taking off Holroyd's collar and tie, unfastening the
waistcoat, the braces and the waist buttons of the trousers; he then
proceeds to unlace the drunken man's boots._

MRS. HOLROYD (_who has been watching closely_)

I shall never get him upstairs.

BLACKMORE

He can sleep here, with a rug or something to cover him. _You_ don't
want him--upstairs?

MRS. HOLROYD

Never again.

BLACKMORE (_after a moment or two of silence_)

He'll be all right down here. Have you got a rug?

MRS. HOLROYD

Yes.

[_She goes upstairs. Blackmore goes into the scullery, returning with
a lading can and towel. He gets hot water from the boiler. Then,
kneeling down, he begins to wipe the drunken man's face lightly with
the flannel, to remove the blood and dirt._

MRS. HOLROYD (_returning_)

What are you doing?

BLACKMORE

Only wiping his face to get the dirt out.

MRS. HOLROYD

I wonder if he'd do as much for you.

BLACKMORE

I hope not.

MRS. HOLROYD

Isn't he horrible, horrible--

BLACKMORE (_looks up at her_)

Don't look at him then.

MRS. HOLROYD

I can't take it in, it's too much.

BLACKMORE

He won't wake. I will stay with you.

MRS. HOLROYD (_earnestly_)

No--oh, no.

BLACKMORE

There will be the drawn sword between us. (_He indicates the figure of
Holroyd, which lies, in effect, as a barrier between them_)

MRS. HOLROYD (_blushing_)

Don't!

BLACKMORE

I'm sorry.

MRS. HOLROYD (_after watching him for a few moments lightly
wiping the sleeping man's face with a towel_) I wonder you can be so
careful over him.

BLACKMORE (_quietly_)

It's only because he's helpless.

MRS. HOLROYD

But why should you love him ever so little?

BLACKMORE

I don't--only he's helpless. Five minutes since I could have killed
him.

MRS. HOLROYD

Well, I don't understand you men.

BLACKMORE

Why?

MRS. HOLROYD

I don't know.

BLACKMORE

I thought as I stood in that doorway, and he was trying to get up--I
wished as hard as I've ever wished anything in my life--

MRS. HOLROYD

What?

BLACKMORE

That I'd killed him. I've never wished anything so much in my life--if
wishes were anything.

MRS. HOLROYD

Don't, it _does_ sound awful.

BLACKMORE

I _could_ have done it, too. He ought to be dead.

MRS. HOLROYD (_pleading_)

No, don't! You know you don't mean it, and you make me feel so awful.

BLACKMORE

I do mean it. It is simply true, what I say.

MRS. HOLROYD

But don't say it.

BLACKMORE

No?

MRS. HOLROYD

No, we've had enough.

BLACKMORE

Give me the rug.

[_She hands it him, and he tucks Holroyd up._

MRS. HOLROYD

You only do it to play on my feelings.

BLACKMORE (_laughing shortly_)

And now give me a pillow--thanks.

[_There is a pause--both look at the sleeping man._

BLACKMORE

I suppose you're fond of him, really.

MRS. HOLROYD

No more.

BLACKMORE

You _were_ fond of him?

MRS. HOLROYD

I was--yes.

BLACKMORE

What did you like in him?

MRS. HOLROYD (_uneasily_)

I don't know.

BLACKMORE

I suppose you really care about him, even now.

MRS. HOLROYD

Why are you so sure of it?

BLACKMORE

Because I think it is so.

MRS. HOLROYD

I did care for him--now he has destroyed it--

BLACKMORE

I don't believe he can destroy it.

MRS. HOLROYD (_with a short laugh_)

Don't you? When you are married you try. You'll find it isn't so hard.

BLACKMORE

But what did you like in him--because he was good-looking, and strong,
and that?

MRS. HOLROYD

I liked that as well. But if a man makes a nuisance of himself, his
good looks are ugly to you, and his strength loathsome. Do you think I
_care_ about a man because he's got big fists, when he is a coward in
his real self?

BLACKMORE

Is he a coward?

MRS. HOLROYD

He _is_--a pettifogging, paltry one.

BLACKMORE

And so you've really done with him?

MRS. HOLROYD

I have.

BLACKMORE

And what are you going to do?

MRS. HOLROYD

I don't know.

BLACKMORE

I suppose nothing. You'll just go on--even if you've done with
him--you'll go on with him.

[_There is a long pause._

BLACKMORE

But was there nothing else in him but his muscles and his good looks
to attract you to him?

MRS. HOLROYD

Why? What does it matter?

BLACKMORE

What did you _think_ he was?

MRS. HOLROYD

Why must we talk about him?

BLACKMORE

Because I can never quite believe you.

MRS. HOLROYD

I can't help whether you believe it or not.

BLACKMORE

Are you just in a rage with him, because of to-night?

MRS. HOLROYD

I know, to-night finished it. But it was never right between us.

BLACKMORE

Never?

MRS. HOLROYD

Not once. And then to-night--no, it's too much; I can't stand any more
of it.

BLACKMORE

I suppose he got tipsy. Then he said he wasn't a married man--vowed he
wasn't, to those paper bonnets. They found out he was, and said he was
frightened of his wife getting to know. Then he said they should all
go to supper at his house--I suppose they came out of mischief.

MRS. HOLROYD

He did it to insult me.

BLACKMORE

Oh, he was a bit tight--you can't say it was deliberate.

MRS. HOLROYD

No, but it shows how he feels toward me. The feeling comes out in
drink.

BLACKMORE

How does he feel toward you?

MRS. HOLROYD

He wants to insult me, and humiliate me, in every moment of his life.
Now I simply despise him.

BLACKMORE

You really don't care any more about him?

MRS. HOLROYD

No.

BLACKMORE (_hesitates_)

And you would leave him?

MRS. HOLROYD

I would leave him, and not care _that_ about him any more. (_She snaps
her fingers_)

BLACKMORE

Will you come with me?

MRS. HOLROYD (_after a reluctant pause_)

Where?

BLACKMORE

To Spain: I can any time have a job there, in a decent part. You could
take the children.

[_The figure of the sleeper stirs uneasily--they watch him._

BLACKMORE

Will you?

MRS. HOLROYD

When would you go?

BLACKMORE

To-morrow, if you like.

MRS. HOLROYD

But why do you want to saddle yourself with me and the children?

BLACKMORE

Because I want to.

MRS. HOLROYD

But you don't love me?

BLACKMORE

Why don't I?

MRS. HOLROYD

You don't.

BLACKMORE

I don't know about that. I don't know anything about love. Only I've
gone on for a year now, and it's got stronger and stronger--

MRS. HOLROYD

What has?

BLACKMORE

This--this wanting you, to live with me. I took no notice of it for a
long time. Now I can't get away from it, at no hour and nohow. (_He
still avoids direct contact with her_)

MRS. HOLROYD

But you'd _like_ to get away from it.

BLACKMORE

I hate a mess of any sort. But if you'll come away with me--you and
the children--

MRS. HOLROYD

But I couldn't--you don't love me--

BLACKMORE

I don't know what you mean by I don't love you.

MRS. HOLROYD

I can feel it.

BLACKMORE

And do you love _me_? (_A pause_)

MRS. HOLROYD

I don't know. Everything is so--so--

[_There is a long pause._

BLACKMORE

How old are you?

MRS. HOLROYD

Thirty-two.

BLACKMORE

I'm twenty-seven.

MRS. HOLROYD

And have you never been in love?

BLACKMORE

I don't think so. I don't know.

MRS. HOLROYD

But you must know. I must go and shut that door that keeps clicking.

[_She rises to go upstairs, making a clatter at the stair foot door.
The noise rouses her husband. As she goes upstairs, he moves, makes
coughing sounds, turns over, and then suddenly sits upright, gazing
at Blackmore. The latter sits perfectly still on the sofa, his head
dropped, hiding his face. His hands are clasped. They remain thus for
a minute._

HOLROYD

Hello! (_He stares fixedly_) Hello! (_His tone is undecided, as if he
mistrusts himself_) What are--who are ter? (_Blackmore does not move;
Holroyd stares blankly; he then turns and looks at the room_) Well, I
dunna know.

[_He staggers to his feet, clinging to the table, and goes groping to
the stairs. They creak loudly under his weight. A doorlatch is heard
to click. In a moment Mrs. Holroyd comes quickly downstairs._

BLACKMORE

Has he gone to bed?

MRS. HOLROYD (_nodding_)

Lying on the bed.

BLACKMORE

Will he settle now?

MRS. HOLROYD

I don't know. He is like that sometimes. He will have delirium tremens
if he goes on.

BLACKMORE (_softly_)

You can't stay with him, you know.

MRS. HOLROYD

And the children?

BLACKMORE

We'll take them.

MRS. HOLROYD

Oh!

[_Her face puckers to cry. Suddenly he starts up and puts his arms
round her, holding her protectively and gently, very caressingly. She
clings to him. They are silent for some moments._

BLACKMORE (_struggling, in an altered voice_)

Look at me and kiss me.

[_Her sobs are heard distinctly. Blackmore lays his hand on her cheek,
caressing her always with his hand._

BLACKMORE

My God, but I hate him! I wish either he was dead or me. (_Mrs.
Holroyd hides against him; her sobs cease; after a while he continues
in the same murmuring fashion_) It can't go on like it any more. I
feel as if I should come in two. I can't keep away from you. I simply
can't. Come with me. Come with me and leave him. If you knew what a
hell it is for me to have you here--and to see him. I can't go without
you, I can't. It's been hell every moment for six months now. You say
I don't love you. Perhaps I don't, for all I know about it. But oh, my
God, don't keep me like it any longer. Why should _he_ have you--and
I've never had anything.

MRS. HOLROYD

Have you never loved anybody?

BLACKMORE

No--I've tried. Kiss me of your own wish--will you?

MRS. HOLROYD

I don't know.

BLACKMORE (_after a pause_)

Let's break clear. Let's go right away. Do you care for me?

MRS. HOLROYD

I don't know. (_She loosens herself, rises dumbly_)

BLACKMORE

When do you think you _will_ know?

[_She sits down helplessly._

MRS. HOLROYD

I don't know.

BLACKMORE

Yes, you do know, really. If he was dead, should you marry me?

MRS. HOLROYD

Don't say it--

BLACKMORE

Why not? If wishing of mine would kill him, he'd soon be out of the
way.

MRS. HOLROYD

But the children!

BLACKMORE

I'm fond of them. I shall have good money.

MRS. HOLROYD

But he's their father.

BLACKMORE

What does that mean--?

MRS. HOLROYD

Yes, I know--(_a pause_) but--

BLACKMORE

Is it _him_ that keeps you?

MRS. HOLROYD

No.

BLACKMORE

Then come with me. Will you? (_He stands waiting for her; then he
turns and takes his overcoat; pulls it on, leaving the collar turned
up, ceasing to twist his cap_) Well--will you tell me to-morrow?

[_She goes forward and flings her arms round his neck. He suddenly
kisses her passionately._

MRS. HOLROYD

But I ought not. (_She draws away a little; he will not let her go_)

BLACKMORE

Yes, it's all right. (_He holds her close_)

MRS. HOLROYD

Is it?

BLACKMORE

Yes, it is. It's all right.

[_He kisses her again. She releases herself but holds his hand. They
keep listening._

MRS. HOLROYD

Do you love me?

BLACKMORE

What do you ask for?

MRS. HOLROYD

Have I hurt you these months?

BLACKMORE

_You_ haven't. And I don't care what it's been if you'll come with me.
(_There is a noise upstairs and they wait_) You _will_ soon, won't
you?

[_She kisses him._

MRS. HOLROYD

He's not safe. (_She disengages herself and sits on the sofa_)

BLACKMORE (_takes a place beside her, holding her hand in
both his_) You should have waited for me.

MRS. HOLROYD

How wait?

BLACKMORE

And not have married him.

MRS. HOLROYD

I might never have known you--I married him to get out of my place.

BLACKMORE

Why?

MRS. HOLROYD

I was left an orphan when I was six. My Uncle John brought me up, in
the Coach and Horses at Rainsworth. He'd got no children. He was good
to me, but he drank. I went to Mansfield Grammar School. Then he fell
out with me because I wouldn't wait in the bar, and I went as nursery
governess to Berryman's. And I felt I'd nowhere to go, I belonged to
nowhere, and nobody cared about me, and men came after me, and I hated
it. So to get out of it, I married the first man that turned up.

BLACKMORE

And you never cared about him?

MRS. HOLROYD

Yes, I did. I did care about him. I wanted to be a wife to him. But
there's nothing at the bottom of him, if you know what I mean. You
can't _get_ anywhere with him. There's just his body and nothing
else. Nothing that keeps him, no anchor, no roots, nothing satisfying.
It's a horrible feeling there is about him, that nothing is safe or
permanent--nothing is anything--

BLACKMORE

And do you think you can trust _me_?

MRS. HOLROYD

I think you're different from him.

BLACKMORE

Perhaps I'm not.

MRS. HOLROYD (_warmly_)

You are.

BLACKMORE

At any rate, we'll see. You'll come on Saturday to London?

MRS. HOLROYD

Well, you see, there's my money. I haven't got it yet. My uncle has
left me about a hundred and twenty pounds.

BLACKMORE

Well, see the lawyer about it as soon as you can. I can let you have
some money if you want any. But don't let us wait after Saturday.

MRS. HOLROYD

But isn't it wrong?

BLACKMORE

Why, if you don't care for him, and the children are miserable between
the two of you--which they are--

MRS. HOLROYD

Yes.

BLACKMORE

Well, then I see no wrong. As for him--he would go one way, and only
one way, whatever you do. Damn him, he doesn't matter.

MRS. HOLROYD

No.

BLACKMORE

Well, then--have done with it. Can't you cut clean of him? Can't you
now?

MRS. HOLROYD

And then--the children--

BLACKMORE

They'll be all right with me and you--won't they?

MRS. HOLROYD

Yes--

BLACKMORE

Well, then. Now, come and have done with it. We can't keep on being
ripped in two like this. We need never hear of him any more.

MRS. HOLROYD

Yes--I love you. I do love you--

BLACKMORE

Oh, my God! (_He speaks with difficulty--embracing her_)

MRS. HOLROYD

When I look at him, and then at you--ha--(_she gives a short laugh_)

BLACKMORE

He's had all the chance--it's only fair--Lizzie--

MRS. HOLROYD

My love.

[_There is silence. He keeps his arm round her. After hesitating, he
picks up his cap._

BLACKMORE

I'll go then--at any rate. Shall you come with me?

[_She follows him to the door._

MRS. HOLROYD

I'll come on Saturday.

BLACKMORE

Not now?


CURTAIN


THE THIRD ACT


_Scene, the same. Time, the following evening, about seven o'clock.
The table is half laid, with a large cup and saucer, plate, etc.,
ready for Holroyd's dinner, which, like all miners, he has when he
comes home between four and five o'clock. On the other half of the
table Mrs. Holroyd is ironing. On the hearth stands newly baked loaves
of bread. The irons hang at the fire._

_Jack, with a bowler hat hanging at the back of his head, parades up
to the sofa, on which stands Minnie engaged in dusting a picture. She
has a soiled white apron tied behind her, to make a long skirt._

JACK

Good mornin', missis. Any scissors or knives to grind?

MINNIE (_peering down from the sofa_)

Oh, I can't be bothered to come downstairs. Call another day.

JACK

I shan't.

MINNIE (_keeping up her part_)

Well, I can't come down now. (_Jack stands irresolute_) Go on, you
have to go and steal the baby.

JACK

I'm not.

MINNIE

Well, you can steal the eggs out of the fowl-house.

JACK

I'm not.

MINNIE

Then I shan't play with you. (_Jack takes off his bowler hat and
flings it on the sofa; tears come in Minnie's eyes_) Now I'm _not_
friends. (_She surveys him ruefully; after a few moments of silence
she clambers down and goes to her mother_) Mam, he won't play with me.

MRS. HOLROYD (_crossly_)

Why don't you play with her? If you begin bothering, you must go to
bed.

JACK

Well, I don't want to play.

MRS. HOLROYD

Then you must go to bed.

JACK

I don't want to.

MRS. HOLROYD

Then what do you want, I should like to know?

MINNIE

I wish my father'd come.

JACK

I do.

MRS. HOLROYD

I suppose he thinks he's paying me out. This is the third time this
week he's slunk past the door and gone down to Old Brinsley instead of
coming in to his dinner. He'll be as drunk as a lord when he does come.

[_The children look at her plaintively._

MINNIE

Isn't he a nuisance?

JACK

I hate him. I wish he'd drop down th' pit-shaft.

MRS. HOLROYD

Jack!--I never heard such a thing in my life! You mustn't say such
things--it's wicked.

JACK

Well, I do.

MRS. HOLROYD (_loudly_)

I won't have it. He's your father, remember.

JACK (_in a high voice_)

Well, he's always comin' home an' shoutin' an' bangin' on the table.
(_He is getting tearful and defiant_)

MRS. HOLROYD

Well, you mustn't take any notice of him.

MINNIE (_wistfully_)

'Appen if you said something nice to him, mother, he'd happen go to
bed, and not shout.

JACK

I'd hit him in the mouth.

MRS. HOLROYD

Perhaps we'll go to another country, away from him--should we?

JACK

In a ship, mother?

MINNIE

In a ship, mam?

MRS. HOLROYD

Yes, in a big ship, where it's blue sky, and water and palm-trees,
and--

MINNIE

An' dates--?

JACK

When should we go?

MRS. HOLROYD

Some day.

MINNIE

But who'd work for us? Who should we have for father?

JACK

You don't want a father. I can go to work for us.

MRS. HOLROYD

I've got a lot of money now, that your uncle left me.

MINNIE (_after a general thoughtful silence_)

An' would my father stop here?

MRS. HOLROYD

Oh, he'd be all right.

MINNIE

But who would he live with?

MRS. HOLROYD

I don't know--one of his paper bonnets, if he likes.

MINNIE

Then she could have her old bracelet back, couldn't she?

MRS. HOLROYD

Yes--there it is on the candlestick, waiting for her.

[_There is a sound of footsteps--then a knock at the door. The
children start._

MINNIE (_in relief_)

Here he is.

[_Mrs. Holroyd goes to the door. Blackmore enters._

BLACKMORE

It is foggy to-night--Hello, aren't you youngsters gone to bed?

MINNIE

No, my father's not come home yet.

BLACKMORE (_turning to Mrs. Holroyd_)

Did he go to work then, after last night?

MRS. HOLROYD

I suppose so. His pit things were gone when I got up. I never thought
he'd go.

BLACKMORE

And he took his snap as usual?

MRS. HOLROYD

Yes, just as usual. I suppose he's gone to the New Inn. He'd say to
himself he'd pay me out. That's what he always does say, "I'll pay
thee out for that bit--I'll ma'e thee regret it."

JACK

We're going to leave him.

BLACKMORE

So you think he's at the New Inn?

MRS. HOLROYD

I'm sure he is--and he'll come when he's full. He'll have a bout now,
you'll see.

MINNIE

Go and fetch him, Mr. Blackmore.

JACK

My mother says we shall go in a ship and leave him.

BLACKMORE (_after looking keenly at Jack: to Mrs. Holroyd_)
Shall I go and see if he's at the New Inn?

MRS. HOLROYD

No--perhaps you'd better not--

BLACKMORE

Oh, he shan't see me. I can easily manage that.

JACK

Fetch him, Mr. Blackmore.

BLACKMORE

All right, Jack. (_To Mrs. Holroyd_) Shall I?

MRS. HOLROYD

We're always pulling on you--But yes, do!

[_Blackmore goes out._

JACK

I wonder how long he'll be.

MRS. HOLROYD

You come and go to bed now: you'd better be out of the way when he
comes in.

MINNIE

And you won't say anything to him, mother, will you?

MRS. HOLROYD

What do you mean?

MINNIE

You won't begin of him--row him.

MRS. HOLROYD

Is he to have all his own way? What _would_ he be like, if I didn't
row him?

JACK

But it doesn't matter, mother, if we're going to leave him--

MINNIE

But Mr. Blackmore'll come back, won't he, mam, and dad won't shout
before him?

MRS. HOLROYD (_beginning to undress the children_)

Yes, he'll come back.

MINNIE

Mam--could I have that bracelet to go to bed with?

MRS. HOLROYD

Come and say your prayers.

[_They kneel, muttering in their mother's apron._

MINNIE (_suddenly lifting her head_)

Can I, mam?

MRS. HOLROYD (_trying to be stern_)

Have you finished your prayers?

MINNIE

Yes.

MRS. HOLROYD

If you want it--beastly thing! (_She reaches the bracelet down from
the mantelpiece_) Your father must have put it up there--I don't know
where I left it. I suppose he'd think I was proud of it and wanted it
for an ornament.

[_Minnie gloats over it. Mrs. Holroyd lights a candle and they go
upstairs. After a few moments the outer door opens, and there enters
an old woman. She is of middling stature and wears a large gray shawl
over her head. After glancing sharply round the room, she advances
to the fire, warms herself, then, taking off her shawl, sits in the
rocking-chair. As she hears Mrs. Holroyd's footsteps, she folds her
hands and puts on a lachrymose expression, turning down the corners of
her mouth and arching her eyebrows._

MRS. HOLROYD

Hello, mother, is it you?

GRANDMOTHER

Yes, it's me. Haven't you finished ironing?

MRS. HOLROYD

Not yet.

GRANDMOTHER

You'll have your irons red-hot.

MRS. HOLROYD

Yes, I s'll have to stand them to cool. (_She does so, and moves about
at her ironing_)

GRANDMOTHER

And you don't know what's become of Charles?

MRS. HOLROYD

Well, he's not come home from work yet. I supposed he was at the New
Inn--Why?

GRANDMOTHER

That young electrician come knocking asking if I knew where he was.
"Eh," I said, "I've not set eyes on him for over a week--nor his wife
neither, though they pass th' garden gate every time they go out. I
know nowt on 'im." I axed him what was the matter, so he said Mrs.
Holroyd was anxious because he'd not come home, so I thought I'd
better come and see. Is there anything up?

MRS. HOLROYD

No more than I've told you.

GRANDMOTHER

It's a rum 'un, if he's neither in the New Inn nor the Prince o'
Wales. I suppose something you've done's set him off.

MRS. HOLROYD

It's nothing I've done.

GRANDMOTHER

Eh, if he's gone off and left you, whativer shall we do! Whativer 'ave
you been doing?

MRS. HOLROYD

He brought a couple of bright daisies here last night--two of those
trollops from Nottingham--and I said I'd not have it.

GRANDMOTHER (_sighing deeply_)

Ay, you've never been able to agree.

MRS. HOLROYD

We agreed well enough except when he drank like a fish and came home
rolling.

GRANDMOTHER (_whining_)

Well, what can you expect of a man as 'as been shut up i' th' pit all
day? He must have a bit of relaxation.

MRS. HOLROYD

He can have it different from that, then. At any rate, I'm sick of it.

GRANDMOTHER

Ay, you've a stiff neck, but it'll be bowed by you're my age.

MRS. HOLROYD

Will it? I'd rather it were broke.

GRANDMOTHER

Well--there's no telling what a jealous man will do. (_She shakes her
head_)

MRS. HOLROYD

Nay, I think it's my place to be jealous, when he brings a brazen
hussy here and sits carryin' on with her.

GRANDMOTHER

He'd no business to do that. But you know, Lizzie, he's got something
on _his_ side.

MRS. HOLROYD

What, pray?

GRANDMOTHER

Well, I don't want to make any mischief, but you're my son's wife,
an' it's nothing but my duty to tell you. They've been saying a long
time now as that young electrician is here a bit too often.

MRS. HOLROYD

He doesn't come for my asking.

GRANDMOTHER

No, I don't suppose he wants for asking. But Charlie's not the man to
put up with that sort o' work.

MRS. HOLROYD

Charlie put up with it! If he's anything to say, why doesn't he say
it, without going to other folks ...?

GRANDMOTHER

Charlie's never been near me with a word--nor 'as he said a word
elsewhere to my knowledge. For all that, this is going to end with
trouble.

MRS. HOLROYD

In this hole, every gossiping creature thinks she's got the right to
cackle about you--sickening! And a parcel of lies.

GRANDMOTHER

Well, Lizzie, I've never said anything against you. Charlie's been a
handful of trouble. He made my heart ache once or twice afore you had
him, and he's made it ache many, many's the time since. But it's not
all on his side, you know.

MRS. HOLROYD (_hotly_)

No, I don't know.

GRANDMOTHER

You thought yourself above him, Lizzie, an' you know he's not the man
to stand it.

MRS. HOLROYD

No, he's run away from it.

GRANDMOTHER (_venomously_)

And what man wouldn't leave a woman that allowed him to live on
sufferance in the house with her, when he was bringing the money home?

MRS. HOLROYD

"Sufferance!"--Yes, there's been a lot of letting him live on
"sufferance" in the house with me. It is _I_ who have lived on
sufferance, for his service and pleasure. No, what he wanted was the
drink and the public house company, and because he couldn't get them
here, he went out for them. That's all.

GRANDMOTHER

You have always been very clever at hitting things off, Lizzie. I was
always sorry my youngest son married a clever woman. He only wanted a
bit of coaxing and managing, and you clever women won't do it.

MRS. HOLROYD

He wanted a slave, not a wife.

GRANDMOTHER

It's a pity your stomach wasn't too high for him, before you had him.
But no, you could have eaten him ravishing at one time.

MRS. HOLROYD

It's a pity you didn't tell me what he was before I had him. But no,
he was all angel. You left me to find out what he really was.

GRANDMOTHER

Some women could have lived with him happy enough. An' a fat lot you'd
have thanked me for my telling.

[_There is a knock at the door. Mrs. Holroyd opens._

RIGLEY

They tell me, missus, as your mester's not hoom yet.

MRS. HOLROYD

No--who is it?

GRANDMOTHER

Ask him to step inside. Don't stan' there lettin' the fog in.

[_Rigley steps in. He is a tall, bony, very roughly hewn collier._

RIGLEY

Good evenin'.

GRANDMOTHER

Oh, is it you, Mr. Rigley? (_In a querulous, spiteful tone to Mrs.
Holroyd_) He butties along with Charlie.

MRS. HOLROYD

Oh!

RIGLEY

An' han yer seen nowt on 'im?

MRS. HOLROYD

No--was he all right at work?

RIGLEY

Well, 'e wor nowt to mention. A bit short, like: 'adna much to say. I
canna ma'e out what 'e's done wi' 'issen. (_He is manifestly uneasy,
does not look at the two women_)

GRANDMOTHER

An' did 'e come up i' th' same bantle wi' you?

RIGLEY

No--'e didna. As Ah was comin' out o' th' stall, Ah shouted, "Art
comin', Charlie? We're a' off." An' 'e said, "Ah'm comin' in a
minute." 'E wor just finishin' a stint, like, an' 'e wanted ter get it
set. An' 'e'd been a bit roughish in 'is temper, like, so I thöwt 'e
didna want ter walk to th' bottom wi' us....

GRANDMOTHER (_wailing_)

An' what's 'e gone an' done to himself?

RIGLEY

Nay, missis, yo munna ax me that. 'E's non done owt as Ah know on.
On'y I wor thinkin', 'appen summat 'ad 'appened to 'im, like, seein'
as nob'dy had any knowings of 'im comin' up.

MRS. HOLROYD

What is the matter, Mr. Rigley? Tell us it out.

RIGLEY

I canna do that, missis. It seems as if 'e niver come up th' pit--as
far as we can make out. 'Appen a bit o' stuff's fell an' pinned 'im.

GRANDMOTHER (_wailing_)

An' 'ave you left 'im lying down there in the pit, poor thing?

RIGLEY (_uneasily_)

I couldna say for certain where 'e is.

MRS. HOLROYD (_agitated_)

Oh, it's very likely not very bad, mother! Don't let us run to meet
trouble.

RIGLEY

We 'ave to 'ope for th' best, missis, all on us.

GRANDMOTHER (_wailing_)

Eh, they'll bring 'im 'ome, I know they will, smashed up an' broke!
An' one of my sons they've burned down pit till the flesh dropped off
'im, an' one was shot till 'is shoulder was all of a mosh, an' they
brought 'em 'ome to me. An' now there's this....

MRS. HOLROYD (_shuddering_)

Oh, don't, mother. (_Appealingly to Rigley_) You don't know that he's
hurt?

RIGLEY (_shaking his head_)

I canna tell you.

MRS. HOLROYD (_in a high hysterical voice_)

Then what is it?

RIGLEY (_very uneasy_)

I canna tell you. But yon young electrician--Mr. Blackmore--'e rung
down to the night deputy, an' it seems as though there's been a fall
or summat....

GRANDMOTHER

Eh, Lizzie, you parted from him in anger. You little knowed how you'd
meet him again.

RIGLEY (_making an effort_)

Well, I'd 'appen best be goin' to see what's betide. (_He goes out_)

GRANDMOTHER

I'm sure I've had my share of bad luck, I have. I'm sure I've brought
up five lads in the pit, through accidents and troubles, and now
there's this. The Lord has treated me very hard, very hard. It's a
blessing, Lizzie, as you've got a bit of money, else what would 'ave
become of the children?

MRS. HOLROYD

Well, if he's badly hurt, there'll be the Union-pay, and sick-pay--we
shall manage. And perhaps it's not very much.

GRANDMOTHER

There's no knowin' but what they'll be carryin' him to die i' th'
hospital.

MRS. HOLROYD

Oh, don't say so, mother--it won't be so bad, you'll see.

GRANDMOTHER

How much money have you, Lizzie, comin'?

MRS. HOLROYD

I don't know--not much over a hundred pounds.

GRANDMOTHER (_shaking her head_)

An' what's that, what's that?

MRS. HOLROYD (_sharply_)

Hush!

GRANDMOTHER (_crying_)

Why, what?

[_Mrs. Holroyd opens the door. In the silence can be heard the pulsing
of the fan engine, then the driving engine chuffs rapidly: there is a
shirr of brakes on the rope as it descends._

MRS. HOLROYD

That's twice they've sent the chair down--I wish we could see.... Hark!

GRANDMOTHER

What is it?

MRS. HOLROYD

Yes--it's stopped at the gate. It's the doctor's.

GRANDMOTHER (_coming to the door_)

What, Lizzie?

MRS. HOLROYD

The doctor's motor. (_She listens acutely_) Dare you stop here,
mother, while I run up to the top an' see?

GRANDMOTHER

You'd better not go, Lizzie, you'd better not. A woman's best away.

MRS. HOLROYD

It is unbearable to wait.

GRANDMOTHER

Come in an' shut the door--it's a cold that gets in your bones. (_She
goes in_)

MRS. HOLROYD

Perhaps while he's in bed we shall have time to change him. It's an
ill wind brings no good. He'll happen be a better man.

GRANDMOTHER

Well, you can but try. Many a woman's thought the same.

MRS. HOLROYD

Oh, dear, I wish somebody would come. He's never been hurt since we
were married.

GRANDMOTHER

No, he's never had a bad accident, all the years he's been in the pit.
He's been luckier than most. But everybody has it, sooner or later.

MRS. HOLROYD (_shivering_)

It _is_ a horrid night.

GRANDMOTHER (_querulous_)

Yes, come your ways in.

MRS. HOLROYD

Hark!

[_There is a quick sound of footsteps. Blackmore comes into the light
of the doorway._

BLACKMORE

They're bringing him.

MRS. HOLROYD (_quickly putting her hand over her breast_)
What is it?

BLACKMORE

You can't tell anything's the matter with him--it's not marked him at
all.

MRS. HOLROYD

Oh, what a blessing! And is it much?

BLACKMORE

Well--

MRS. HOLROYD

What is it?

BLACKMORE

It's the worst.

GRANDMOTHER

Who is it?--What does he say?

[_Mrs. Holroyd sinks on the nearest chair with a horrified expression.
Blackmore pulls himself together and enters. He is very pale._

BLACKMORE

I came to tell you they're bringing him home.

GRANDMOTHER

And you said it wasn't very bad, did you?

BLACKMORE

No--I said it was--as bad as it could be.

MRS. HOLROYD (_rising and crossing to her mother-in-law,
flings her arms round her; in a high voice_) Oh, mother, what shall we
do? What shall we do?

GRANDMOTHER

You don't mean to say he's dead?

BLACKMORE

Yes.

GRANDMOTHER (_staring_)

God help us, and how was it?

BLACKMORE

Some stuff fell.

GRANDMOTHER (_rocking herself and her daughter-in-law--both
weeping_) Oh, God have mercy on us! Oh, God have mercy on us! Some
stuff fell on him. An' he'd not even time to cry for mercy; oh, God
spare him! Oh, what shall we do for comfort? To be taken straight
out of his sins. Oh, Lizzie, to think he should be cut off in his
wickedness! He's been a bad lad of late, he has, poor lamb. He's gone
very wrong of late years, poor dear lamb, very wrong. Oh, Lizzie,
think what's to become of him now! If only you'd have tried to be
different with him.

MRS. HOLROYD (_moaning_)

Don't, mother, don't. I can't bear it.

BLACKMORE (_cold and clear_)

Where will you have him laid? The men will be here in a moment.

MRS. HOLROYD (_starting up_)

They can carry him up to bed--

BLACKMORE

It's no good taking him upstairs. You'll have to wash him and lay him
out.

MRS. HOLROYD (_startled_)

Well--

BLACKMORE

He's in his pit-dirt.

GRANDMOTHER

He is, bless him. We'd better have him down here, Lizzie, where we can
handle him.

MRS. HOLROYD

Yes.

[_She begins to put the tea things away, but drops the sugar out of
the basin and the lumps fly broadcast._

BLACKMORE

Never mind, I'll pick those up. You put the children's clothes away.

[_Mrs. Holroyd stares witless around. The Grandmother sits rocking
herself and weeping. Blackmore clears the table, putting the pots in
the scullery. He folds the white tablecloth and pulls back the table.
The door opens. Mrs. Holroyd utters a cry. Rigley enters._

RIGLEY

They're bringing him now, missis.

MRS. HOLROYD

Oh!

RIGLEY (_simply_)

There must ha' been a fall directly after we left him.

MRS. HOLROYD (_frowning, horrified_)

No--no!

RIGLEY (_to Blackmore_)

It fell a' back of him, an' shut 'im in as you might shut a loaf i'
th' oven. It never touched him.

MRS. HOLROYD (_staring distractedly_)

Well, then--

RIGLEY

You see, it come on 'im as close as a trap on a mouse, an' gen him no
air, an' what wi' th' gas, it smothered him. An' it wouldna be so very
long about it neither.

MRS. HOLROYD (_quiet with horror_)

Oh!

GRANDMOTHER

Eh, dear--dear. Eh, dear--dear.

RIGLEY (_looking hard at her_)

I wasna to know what 'ud happen.

GRANDMOTHER (_not heeding him, but weeping all the time_) But
the Lord gave him time to repent. He'd have a few minutes to repent.
Ay, I hope he did, I hope he did, else what was to become of him. The
Lord cut him off in his sins, but He gave him time to repent.

[_Rigley looks away at the wall. Blackmore has made a space in the
middle of the floor._

BLACKMORE

If you'll take the rocking-chair off the end of the rug, Mrs. Holroyd,
I can pull it back a bit from the fire, and we can lay him on that.

GRANDMOTHER (_petulantly_)

What's the good of messing about--(_She moves_)

MRS. HOLROYD

It suffocated him?

RIGLEY (_shaking his head, briefly_)

Yes. 'Appen th' after-damp--

BLACKMORE

He'd be dead in a few minutes.

MRS. HOLROYD

No--oh, think!

BLACKMORE

You mustn't think.

RIGLEY (_suddenly_)

They commin'!

[_Mrs. Holroyd stands at bay. The Grandmother half rises. Rigley and
Blackmore efface themselves as much as possible. A man backs into the
room, bearing the feet of the dead man, which are shod in great pit
boots. As the head bearer comes awkwardly past the table, the coat
with which the body is covered slips off, revealing Holroyd in his
pit-dirt, naked to the waist._

MANAGER (_a little stout, white-bearded man_)

Mind now, mind. Ay, missis, what a job, indeed, it is! (_Sharply_)
Where mun they put him?

MRS. HOLROYD (_turning her face aside from the corpse_)

Lay him on the rug.

MANAGER

Steady now, do it steady.

SECOND BEARER (_rising and pressing back his shoulders_) By
Guy, but 'e 'ings heavy.

MANAGER

Yi, Joe, I'll back my life o' that.

GRANDMOTHER

Eh, Mr. Chambers, what's this affliction on my old age. You kept your
sons out o' the pit, but all mine's in. And to think of the trouble
I've had--to think o' the trouble that's come out of Brinsley pit to
me.

MANAGER

It has that, it 'as that, missis. You seem to have had more 'n your
share; I'll admit it, you have.

MRS. HOLROYD (_who has been staring at the men_)

It is too much!

[_Blackmore frowns; Rigley glowers at her._

MANAGER

You never knowed such a thing in your life. Here's a man, holin' a
stint, just finishin' (_He puts himself as if in the holer's position,
gesticulating freely_) An' a lot o' stuff falls behind him, clean as
a whistle, shuts him up safe as a worm in a nut and niver touches
him--niver knowed such a thing in your life.

MRS. HOLROYD

Ugh!

MANAGER

It niver hurt him--niver touched him.

MRS. HOLROYD

Yes, but--but how long would he _be_ (_she makes a sweeping gesture;
the Manager looks at her and will not help her out_)--how long would
it take--oh--to--to kill him?

MANAGER

Nay, I canna tell ye. 'E didna seem to ha' strived much to get
out--did he, Joe?

SECOND BEARER

No, not as far as Ah 'n seen.

FIRST BEARER

You look at 'is 'ands, you'll see then. 'E'd non ha'e room to swing
the pick.

[_The Manager goes on his knees._

MRS. HOLROYD (_shuddering_)

Oh, don't!

MANAGER

Ay, th' nails is broken a bit--

MRS. HOLROYD (_clenching her fists_)

Don't!

MANAGER

'E'd be sure ter ma'e a bit of a fight. But th' gas 'ud soon get hold
on 'im. Ay, it's an awful thing to think of, it is indeed.

MRS. HOLROYD (_her voice breaking_)

I can't bear it!

MANAGER

Eh, dear, we none on us know what's comin' next.

MRS. HOLROYD (_getting hysterical_)

Oh, it's too awful, it's too awful!

BLACKMORE

You'll disturb the children.

GRANDMOTHER

And you don't want _them_ down here.

MANAGER

'E'd no business to ha' been left, you know.

RIGLEY

An' what man, dost think, wor goin' to sit him down on his hams an'
wait for a chap as wouldna say "thank yer" for his cump'ny? 'E'd bin
ready to fall out wi' a flicker o' the candle, so who dost think wor
goin' ter stop when we knowed 'e on'y kep on so's to get shut on us.

MANAGER

Tha'rt quite right, Bill, quite right. But theer you are.

RIGLEY

An' if we'd stopped, what good would it ha' done--

MANAGER

No, 'appen not, 'appen not.

RIGLEY

For, not known--

MANAGER

I'm sayin' nowt agen thee, neither one road nor t'other. (_There is
general silence--then, to Mrs. Holroyd_) I should think th' inquest'll
be at th' New Inn to-morrow, missis. I'll let you know.

MRS. HOLROYD

Will there have to be an inquest?

MANAGER

Yes--there'll have to be an inquest. Shall you want anybody in, to
stop with you to-night?

MRS. HOLROYD

No.

MANAGER

Well, then, we'd best be goin'. I'll send my missis down first thing
in the morning. It's a bad job, a bad job, it is. You'll be a' right
then?

MRS. HOLROYD

Yes.

MANAGER

Well, good-night then--good-night all.

ALL

Good-night. Good-night.

[_The Manager, followed by the two bearers, goes out, closing the
door._

RIGLEY

It's like this, missis. I never should ha' gone, if he hadn't wanted
us to.

MRS. HOLROYD

Yes, I know.

RIGLEY

'E wanted to come up by's sen.

MRS. HOLROYD (_wearily_)

I know how it was, Mr. Rigley.

RIGLEY

Yes--

BLACKMORE

Nobody could foresee.

RIGLEY (_shaking his head_)

No. If there's owt, missis, as you want--

MRS. HOLROYD

Yes--I think there isn't anything.

RIGLEY (_after a moment_)

Well--good-night--we've worked i' the same stall ower four years now--

MRS. HOLROYD

Yes.

RIGLEY

Well, good-night, missis.

MRS. HOLROYD AND BLACKMORE

Good-night.

[_The Grandmother all this time has been rocking herself to and fro,
moaning and murmuring beside the dead man. When Rigley has gone Mrs.
Holroyd stands staring distractedly before her. She has not yet looked
at her husband._

GRANDMOTHER

Have you got the things ready, Lizzie?

MRS. HOLROYD

What things?

GRANDMOTHER

To lay the child out.

MRS. HOLROYD (_she shudders_)

No--what?

GRANDMOTHER

Haven't you put him by a pair o' white stockings, nor a white shirt?

MRS. HOLROYD

He's got a white cricketing shirt--but not white stockings.

GRANDMOTHER

Then he'll have to have his father's. Let me look at the shirt,
Lizzie. (_Mrs. Holroyd takes one from the dresser drawer_) This'll
never do--a cold, canvas thing wi' a turn down collar. I s'll 'ave
to fetch his father's. (_Suddenly_) You don't want no other woman to
touch him, to wash him and lay him out, do you?

MRS. HOLROYD (_weeping_)

No.

GRANDMOTHER

Then I'll fetch him his father's gear. We mustn't let him set, he'll
be that heavy, bless him. (_She takes her shawl_) I shan't be more
than a few minutes, an' the young fellow can stop here till I come
back.

BLACKMORE

Can't I go for you, Mrs. Holroyd?

GRANDMOTHER

No. _You_ couldn't find the things. We'll wash him as soon as I get
back, Lizzie.

MRS. HOLROYD

All right.

[_She watches her mother-in-law go out. Then she starts, goes in
the scullery for a bowl, in which she pours warm water. She takes a
flannel and soap and towel. She stands, afraid to go any farther._

BLACKMORE

Well!

MRS. HOLROYD

This is a judgment on us.

BLACKMORE

Why?

MRS. HOLROYD

On me, it is--

BLACKMORE

How?

MRS. HOLROYD

It is.

[_Blackmore shakes his head._

MRS. HOLROYD

Yesterday you talked of murdering him.

BLACKMORE

Well!

MRS. HOLROYD

Now we've done it.

BLACKMORE

How?

MRS. HOLROYD

He'd have come up with the others, if he hadn't felt--felt me
murdering him.

BLACKMORE

But we can't help it.

MRS. HOLROYD

It's my fault.

BLACKMORE

Don't be like that!

MRS. HOLROYD (_looking at him--then indicating her husband_)
I daren't see him.

BLACKMORE

No?

MRS. HOLROYD

I've killed him, that is all.

BLACKMORE

No, you haven't.

MRS. HOLROYD

Yes, I have.

BLACKMORE

_We_ couldn't help it.

MRS. HOLROYD

If he hadn't felt, if he hadn't _known_, he wouldn't have stayed, he'd
have come up with the rest.

BLACKMORE

Well, and even if it was so, we can't help it now.

MRS. HOLROYD

But we've killed him.

BLACKMORE

Ah, I'm tired--

MRS. HOLROYD

Yes.

BLACKMORE (_after a pause_)

Shall I stay?

MRS. HOLROYD

I--I daren't be alone with him.

BLACKMORE (_sitting down_)

No.

MRS. HOLROYD

I don't love him. Now he's dead. I don't love him. He lies like he did
yesterday.

BLACKMORE

I suppose, being dead--I don't know--

MRS. HOLROYD

I think you'd better go.

BLACKMORE (_rising_)

Tell me.

MRS. HOLROYD

Yes.

BLACKMORE

You want me to go.

MRS. HOLROYD

No--but _do_ go. (_They look at each other_)

BLACKMORE

I shall come to-morrow (_he goes out_)

[_Mrs. Holroyd stands very stiff, as if afraid of the dead man. Then
she stoops down and begins to sponge his face, talking to him._

MRS. HOLROYD

My dear, my dear--oh, my dear! I can't bear it, my dear--you shouldn't
have done it. You shouldn't have done it. Oh--I can't bear it, for
you. Why couldn't I do anything for you? The children's father--my
dear--I wasn't good to you. But you shouldn't have done this to me.
Oh, dear, oh, dear! Did it hurt you?--oh, my dear, it hurt you--oh, I
can't bear it. No, things aren't fair--we went wrong, my dear. I never
loved you enough--I never did. What a shame for you! It was a shame.
But you didn't--you didn't try. I _would_ have loved you--I tried
hard. What a shame for you! It was so cruel for you. You couldn't help
it--my dear, my dear. You couldn't help it. And I can't do anything
for you, and it hurt you so! (_She weeps bitterly, so her tears fall
on the dead man's face; suddenly she kisses him_) My dear, my dear,
what can I do for you, what can I? (_She weeps as she wipes his face
gently_)

GRANDMOTHER (_enters, puts a bundle on the table, takes off
her shawl_) You're not all by yourself?

MRS. HOLROYD

Yes.

GRANDMOTHER

It's a wonder you're not frightened. You've not washed his face.

MRS. HOLROYD

Why should I be afraid of him--now, mother?

GRANDMOTHER (_weeping_)

Ay, poor lamb, I can't think as ever you could have had reason to be
frightened of him, Lizzie.

MRS. HOLROYD

Yes--once--

GRANDMOTHER

Oh, but he went wrong. An' he was a taking lad, as iver was. (_She
cries pitifully_) And when I waked his father up and told him, he sat
up in bed staring over his whiskers, and said should he come up? But
when I'd managed to find the shirt and things, he was still in bed.
You don't know what it is to live with a man that has no feeling. But
you've washed him, Lizzie?

MRS. HOLROYD

I was finishing his head.

GRANDMOTHER

Let me do it, child.

MRS. HOLROYD

I'll finish that.

GRANDMOTHER

Poor lamb--poor dear lamb! Yet I wouldn't wish him back, Lizzie. He
must ha' died peaceful, Lizzie. He seems to be smiling. He always had
such a rare smile on him--not that he's smiled much of late--

MRS. HOLROYD

I loved him for that.

GRANDMOTHER

Ay--my poor child--my poor child.

MRS. HOLROYD

He looks nice, mother.

GRANDMOTHER

I hope he made his peace with the Lord.

MRS. HOLROYD

Yes.

GRANDMOTHER

If he hadn't time to make his peace with the Lord, I've no hopes of
him. Dear o' me, dear o' me. Is there another bit of flannel anywhere?

[_Mrs. Holroyd rises and brings a piece. The Grandmother begins to
wash the breast of the dead man._

GRANDMOTHER

Well, I hope you'll be true to his children at least, Lizzie. (_Mrs.
Holroyd weeps--the old woman continues her washing_) Eh--and he's fair
as a lily. Did you ever see a man with a whiter skin--and flesh as
fine as the driven snow. He's beautiful, he is, the lamb. Many's the
time I've looked at him, and I've felt proud of him, I have. And now
he lies here. And such arms on 'im! Look at the vaccination marks,
Lizzie. When I took him to be vaccinated, he had a little pink bonnet
with a feather. (_Weeps_) Don't cry, my girl, don't. Sit up an' wash
him a' that side, or we s'll never have him done. Oh, Lizzie!

MRS. HOLROYD (_sitting up, startled_)

What--what?

GRANDMOTHER

Look at his poor hand!

[_She holds up the right hand. The nails are bloody._

MRS. HOLROYD

Oh, no! Oh, no! No!

[_Both women weep._

GRANDMOTHER (_after awhile_)

We maun get on, Lizzie.

MRS. HOLROYD (_sitting up_)

I can't touch his hands.

GRANDMOTHER

But I'm his mother--there's nothing I couldn't do for him.

MRS. HOLROYD

I don't care--I don't care.

GRANDMOTHER

Prithee, prithee, Lizzie, I don't want thee goin' off, Lizzie.

MRS. HOLROYD (_moaning_)

Oh, what shall I do!

GRANDMOTHER

Why, go thee an' get his feet washed. He's setting stiff, and how
shall we get him laid out?

[_Mrs. Holroyd, sobbing, goes, kneels at the miner's feet, and begins
pulling off the great boots._

GRANDMOTHER

There's hardly a mark on him. Eh, what a man he is! I've had some fine
sons, Lizzie, I've had some big men of sons.

MRS. HOLROYD

He was always a lot whiter than me. And he used to chaff me.

GRANDMOTHER

But his poor hands! I used to thank God for my children, but they're
rods o' trouble, Lizzie, they are. Unfasten his belt, child. Me mun
get his things off soon, or else we s'll have such a job.

[_Mrs. Holroyd, having dragged off the boots, rises. She is weeping._

ACT I


SCENE I

  Sunday morning.  Market-place of a large mining village in the
  Midlands.  A man addressing a small gang of colliers from the
  foot of a stumpy memorial obelisk.  Church bells heard.
  Churchgoers passing along the outer pavements.


WILLIE HOUGHTON. What's the matter with you folks, as I've told you
before, and as I shall keep on telling you every now and again, though
it doesn't make a bit of difference, is that you've got no idea of
freedom whatsoever. I've lived in this blessed place for fifty years,
and I've never seen the spark of an idea, nor of any response to an
idea, come out of a single one of you, all the time. I don't know what
it is with colliers--whether it's spending so much time in the bowels
of the earth--but they never seem to be able to get their thoughts above
their bellies. If you've got plenty to eat and drink, and a bit over to
keep the missis quiet, you're satisfied. I never saw such a satisfied
bloomin' lot in my life as you Barlow & Wasall's men are, really. Of
course you can growse as well as anybody, and you do growse. But you
don't do anything else. You're stuck in a sort of mud of contentment,
and you feel yourselves sinking, but you make no efforts to get out. You
bleat a bit, like sheep in a bog--but you like it, you know. You like
sinking in--you don't have to stand on your own feet then.

I'll tell you what'll happen to you chaps. I'll give you a little
picture of what you'll be like in the future. Barlow & Walsall's 'll
make a number of compounds, such as they keep niggers in in South
Africa, and there you'll be kept. And every one of you'll have a little
brass collar round his neck, with a number on it. You won't have names
any more. And you'll go from the compound to the pit, and from the
pit back again to the compound. You won't be allowed to go outside the
gates, except at week-ends. They'll let you go home to your wives on
Saturday nights, to stop over Sunday. But you'll have to be in again
by half-past nine on Sunday night; and if you're late, you'll have your
next week-end knocked off. And there you'll be--and you'll be quite
happy. They'll give you plenty to eat, and a can of beer a day, and a
bit of bacca--and they'll provide dominoes and skittles for you to play
with. And you'll be the most contented set of men alive.--But you won't
be men. You won't even be animals. You'll go from number one to number
three thousand, a lot of numbered slaves--a new sort of slaves---

VOICE. An' wheer shall thee be, Willie?

WILLIE. Oh, I shall be outside the palings, laughing at you. I shall
have to laugh, because it'll be your own faults. You'll have nobody but
yourself to thank for it. You don't WANT to be men. You'd rather NOT be
free--much rather. You're like those people spoken of in Shakespeare:
"Oh, how eager these men are to be slaves!" I believe it's
Shakespeare--or the Bible--one or the other--it mostly is---

ANABEL WRATH (she was passing to church). It was Tiberius.

WILLIE. Eh?

ANABEL. Tiberius said it.

WILLIE. Tiberius!--Oh, did he? (Laughs.) Thanks! Well, if Tiberius said
it, there must be something in it, and he only just missed being in the
Bible anyway. He was a day late, or they'd have had him in. "Oh, how
eager these men are to be slaves!"--It's evident the Romans deserved all
they got from Tiberius--and you'll deserve all you get, every bit of
it. But don't you bother, you'll get it. You won't be at the mercy
of Tiberius, you'll be at the mercy of something a jolly sight worse.
Tiberius took the skin off a few Romans, apparently. But you'll have
the soul taken out of you--every one of you. And I'd rather lose my skin
than my soul, any day. But perhaps you wouldn't.

VOICE. What art makin' for, Willie? Tha seems to say a lot, but tha goes
round it. Tha'rt like a donkey on a gin. Tha gets ravelled.

WILLIE. Yes, that's just it. I am precisely like a donkey on a gin--a
donkey that's trying to wind a lot of colliers up to the surface.
There's many a donkey that's brought more colliers than you up to see
daylight, by trotting round.--But do you want to know what I'm making
for? I can soon tell you that. You Barlow & Wasall's men, you haven't a
soul to call your own. Barlow & Wasall's have only to say to one of you,
Come, and he cometh, Go, and he goeth, Lie VOICE. Ay--an' what about it?
Tha's got a behind o' thy own, hasn't yer?

WILLIE. Do you stand there and ask me what about it, and haven't the
sense to alter it? Couldn't you set up a proper Government to-morrow, if
you liked? Couldn't you contrive that the pits belonged to you, instead
of you belonging to the pits, like so many old pit-ponies that stop down
till they are blind, and take to eating coal-slack for meadow-grass, not
knowing the difference? If only you'd learn to think, I'd respect you.
As you are, I can't, not if I try my hardest. All you can think of is
to ask for another shilling a day. That's as far as your imagination
carries you. And perhaps you get sevenpence ha'penny, but pay for it
with half-a-crown's worth of sweat. The masters aren't fools--as you
are. They'll give you two-thirds of what you ask for, but they'll get
five-thirds of it back again--and they'll get it out of your flesh and
blood, too, in jolly hard work. Shylock wasn't in it with them. He only
wanted a pound of flesh. But you cheerfully give up a pound a week, each
one of you, and keep on giving it up.--But you don't seem to see these
things. You can't think beyond your dinners and your 'lowance. You think
if you can get another shilling a day you're set up. You make me tired,
I tell you.

JOB ARTHUR FREER. We think of others besides ourselves.

WILLIE. Hello, Job Arthur--are you there? I didn't recognise you without
your frock-coat and silk hat--on the Sabbath.--What was that you said?
You think of something else, besides yourselves?--Oh ay--I'm glad to
hear it. Did you mean your own importance?


    (A motor car, GERALD BARLOW driving, OLIVER TURTON with him has
     pulled up.)


JOB ARTHUR (glancing at the car). No, I didn't.

WILLIE. Didn't you, though?--Come, speak up, let us have it. The more
the merrier. You were going to say something.

JOB ARTHUR. Nay, you were doing the talking.

WILLIE. Yes, so I was, till you interrupted, with a great idea on the
tip of your tongue. Come, spit it out. No matter if Mr. Barlow hears
you. You know how sorry for you we feel, that you've always got to make
your speeches twice--once to those above, and once to us here below I
didn't meant the angels and the devils, but never mind. Speak up, Job
Arthur.

JOB ARTHUR. It's not everybody as has as much to say as you, Mr.
Houghton.

WILLIE. No, not in the open--that's a fact. Some folks says a great deal
more, in semi-private. You were just going to explain to me, on
behalf of the men, whom you so ably represent and so wisely lead, Job
Arthur--we won't say by the nose--you were just going to tell me--on
behalf of the men, of course, not of the masters--that you think of
others, besides yourself. Do you mind explaining WHAT others?

JOB ARTHUR. Everybody's used to your talk, Mr. Houghton, and for that
reason it doesn't make much impression. What I meant to say, in plain
words, was that we have to think of what's best for everybody, not only
of ourselves.

WILLIE. Oh, I see. What's best for everybody! I see! Well, for myself,
I'm much obliged--there's nothing for us to do, gentlemen, but for all
of us to bow acknowledgments to Mr. Job Arthur Freer, who so kindly has
ALL our interests at heart.

JOB ARTHUR. I don't profess to be a red-rag Socialist. I don't pretend
to think that if the Government had the pits it would be any better for
us. No. What I mean is, that the pits are there and every man on this
place depends on them, one way or another. They're the cow that gives
the milk. And what I mean is, how every man shall have a proper share
of the milk, which is food and living. It's like killing the goose that
laid the golden egg. I want to keep the cow healthy and strong. And the
cow is the pits, and we're the men that depend on the pits.

WILLIE. Who's the cat that's going to lick the cream?

JOB ARTHUR. My position is this--and I state it before masters and
men--that it's our business to strike such a balance between the
interests of the men and the interests of the masters that the pits
remain healthy, and everybody profits.

WILLIE. You're out for the millennium, I can see--with Mr. Job Arthur
Freer striking the balance. We all see you, Job Arthur, one foot on
either side of the fence, balancing the see-saw, with masters at one
end and men at the other. You'll have to give one side a lot of
pudding.--But go back a bit, to where we were before the motor car took
your breath away. When you said, Job Arthur, that you think of others
besides yourself, didn't you mean, as a matter of fact, the office men?
Didn't you mean that the colliers, led--we won't mention noses--by you,
were going to come out in sympathy with the office clerks, supposing
they didn't get the rise in wages which they've asked for--the office
clerks? Wasn't that it?

JOB ARTHUR. There's been some talk among the men of standing by the
office. I don't know what they'll do. But they'll do it of their own
decision, whatever it is.

WILLIE. There's not a shadow of doubt about it, Job Arthur. But it's a
funny thing the decisions all have the same foxy smell about them, Job
Arthur.

OLIVER TURTON (calling from the car). What was the speech about, in the
first place?

WILLIE. I beg pardon?

OLIVER. What was the address about, to begin with?

WILLIE. Oh, the same old hat--Freedom. But partly it's given to
annoy the Unco Guid, as they pass to their Sabbath banquet of
self-complacency.

OLIVER. What ABOUT Freedom?

WILLIE. Very much as usual, I believe. But you should have been here ten
minutes sooner, before we began to read the lessons. (Laughs.)

ANABEL W. (moving forward, and holding out her hand). You'd merely have
been told what Freedom ISN'T; and you know that already. How are you,
Oliver?

OLIVER. Good God, Anabel!--are you part of the meeting? How long have
you been back in England?

ANABEL. Some months, now. My family have moved here, you know.

OLIVER. Your family! Where have they moved from?--from the moon?

ANABEL. No, only from Derby.--How are you, Gerald?


(GERALD twists in his seat to give her his hand.)


GERALD. I saw you before.

ANABEL. Yes, I know you did.


   (JOB ARTHUR has disappeared. The men disperse sheepishly into groups,
     to stand and sit on their heels by the walls and the causeway
     edge.  WILLIE HOUGHTON begins to talk to individuals.)


OLIVER. Won't you get in and drive on with us a little way?

ANABEL. No, I was going to church.

OLIVER. Going to church! Is that a new habit?

ANABEL. Not a habit. But I've been twice since I saw you last.

OLIVER. I see. And that's nearly two years ago. It's an annual thing,
like a birthday?

ANABEL. No. I'll go on, then.

OLIVER. You'll be late now.

ANABEL. Shall I? It doesn't matter.

OLIVER. We are going to see you again, aren't we?

ANABEL (after a pause). Yes, I hope so, Oliver.

OLIVER. How have you been these two years--well?--happy?

ANABEL. No, neither. How have you?

OLIVER. Yes, fairly happy. Have you been ill?

ANABEL. Yes, in France I was very ill.

OLIVER. Your old neuritis?

ANABEL. No. My chest. Pneumonia--oh, a complication.

OLIVER. How sickening! Who looked after you? Is it better?

ANABEL. Yes, it's a great deal better.

OLIVER. But, Anabel--we must fix a meeting. I say, wait just a moment.
Could I call on your people? Go into town with me one day. I don't know
whether Gerald intends to see you--whether he intends to ask you to
Lilley Close.

GERALD. Oh, it's all right.

ANABEL. He's no need. I'm fixed up there already.

GERALD. What do you mean?

ANABEL. I am at Lilley Close every day--or most days--to work with your
sister Winifred in the studio.

GERALD. What?--why, how's that?

ANABEL. Your father asked me. My father was already giving her some
lessons.

GERALD. And you're at our house every day?

ANABEL. Most days.

GERALD. Well, I'm--well, I'll be--you managed it very sharp, didn't you?
I've only been away a fort-night.

ANABEL. Your father asked me--he offered me twelve pounds a month--I
wanted to do something.

GERALD. Oh yes, but you didn't hire yourself out at Lilley Close as a
sort of upper servant just for twelve pounds a month.

ANABEL. You're wrong--you're wrong. I'm not a sort of upper servant at
all--not at all.

GERALD. Oh, yes, you are, if you're paid twelve pounds a month--three
pounds a week. That's about what father's sick-nurse gets, I believe.
You don't do it for twelve pounds a month. You can make twelve pounds
in a day, if you like to work at your little models: I know you can sell
your statuette things as soon as you make them.

ANABEL. But I CAN'T make them. I CAN'T make them. I've lost the
spirit--the--_joi de vivre_--I don't know what, since I've been ill. I
tell you I've GOT to earn something.

GERALD. Nevertheless, you won't make me believe, Anabel, that you've
come and buried yourself in the provinces--SUCH provinces--just to earn
father's three pounds a week. Why don't you admit it, that you came back
to try and take up the old threads.

OLIVER. Why not, Gerald? Don't you think we ought to take up the old
threads?

GERALD. I don't think we ought to be left without choice. I don't think
Anabel ought to come back and thrust herself on me--for that's what it
amounts to, after all--when one remembers what's gone before.

ANABEL. I DON'T thrust myself on you at all. I know I'm a fool, a fool,
to come back. But I wanted to. I wanted to see you again. Now I know
I've presumed. I've made myself CHEAP to you. I wanted to--I wanted to.
And now I've done it, I won't come to Lilley Close again, nor anywhere
where you are. Tell your father I have gone to France again--it will be
true.

GERALD. You play tricks on me--and on yourself. You know you do. You
do it for the pure enjoyment of it. You're making a scene here in this
filthy market-place, just for the fun of it. You like to see these
accursed colliers standing eyeing you, and squatting on their heels. You
like to catch me out, here where I'm known, where I've been the object
of their eyes since I was born. This is a great _coup de main_ for you.
I knew it the moment I saw you here.

OLIVER. After all, we ARE making a scene in the market-place. Get in,
Anabel, and we'll settle the dispute more privately. I'm glad you came
back, anyhow. I'm glad you came right down on us. Get in, and let us run
down to Whatmore.

ANABEL. No, Oliver. I don't want to run down to Whatmore. I wanted to
see you--I wanted to see Gerald--and I've seen him--and I've heard
him. That will suffice me. We'll make an end of the scene in the
market-place. (She turns away.)

OLIVER. I knew it wasn't ended. I knew she would come back and tell us
she'd come. But she's done her bit--now she'll go again. My God, what a
fool of a world!--You go on, Gerald--I'll just go after her and see it
out. (Calls.) One moment, Anabel.

ANABEL (calling). Don't come, Oliver. (Turns.)

GERALD. Anabel! (Blows the horn of the motor car violently and
agitatively--she looks round--turns again as if frightened.) God damn
the woman! (Gets down from the car.) Drive home for me, Oliver.


(Curtain.)



SCENE II

  WINIFRED'S studio at Lilley Close.  ANABEL and WINIFRED working
  at a model in clay.


WINIFRED. But isn't it lovely to be in Paris, and to have exhibitions,
and to be famous?

ANABEL. Paris WAS a good place. But I was never famous.

WINIFRED. But your little animals and birds were famous. Jack said so.
You know he brought us that bronze thrush that is singing, that is in
his room. He has only let me see it twice. It's the loveliest thing I've
ever seen. Oh, if I can do anything like that!--I've worshipped it, I
have. It is your best thing?

ANABEL. One of the best.

WINIFRED. It must be. When I see it, with its beak lifted, singing,
something comes loose in my heart, and I feel as if I should cry, and
fly up to heaven. Do you know what I mean? Oh, I'm sure you do, or you
could never have made that thrush. Father is so glad you've come to show
me how to work. He says now I shall have a life-work, and I shall be
happy. It's true, too.

ANABEL. Yes, till the life-work collapses.

WINIFRED. Oh, it can't collapse. I can't believe it could collapse. Do
tell me about something else you made, which you loved--something you
sculpted. Oh, it makes my heart burn to hear you!--Do you think I might
call you Anabel? I should love to. You do call me Winifred already.

ANABEL. Yes, do.

WINIFRED. Won't you tell me about something else you made--something
lovely?

ANABEL. Well, I did a small kitten--asleep--with its paws crossed. You
know, Winifred, that wonderful look that kittens have, as if they were
blown along like a bit of fluff--as if they weighed nothing at all, just
wafted about--and yet so ALIVE--do you know---?

WINIFRED. Darlings--darlings--I love them!

ANABEL. Well my kitten really came off--it had that quality. It looked
as if it had just wafted there.

WINIFRED. Oh, yes!--oh, I know! And was it in clay?

ANABEL. I cut it in soft grey stone as well. I love my kitten. An
Armenian bought her.

WINIFRED. And where is she now?

ANABEL. I don't know--in Armenia, I suppose, if there is such a place.
It would have to be kept under glass, because the stone wouldn't
polish--and I didn't want it polished. But I dislike things under
glass--don't you?

WINIFRED. Yes, I do. We had a golden clock, but Gerald wouldn't have the
glass cover, and Daddy wouldn't have it without. So now the clock is in
father's room. Gerald often went to Paris. Oliver used to have a studio
there. I don't care much for painting, do you?

ANABEL. No. I want something I can touch, if it's something outside me.

WINIFRED. Yes, isn't it wonderful, when things are substantial. Gerald
and Oliver came back yesterday from Yorkshire. You know we have a
colliery there.

ANABEL. Yes, I believe I've heard.

WINIFRED. I want to introduce you to Gerald, to see if you like him.
He's good at the bottom, but he's very overbearing and definite.

ANABEL. Is he?

WINIFRED. Terribly clever in business. He'll get awfully rich.

ANABEL. Isn't he rich enough already?

WINIFRED. Oh, yes, because Daddy is rich enough, really. I think if
Gerald was a bit different, he'd be really nice. Now he's so MANAGING.
It's sickening. Do you dislike managing people, Anabel?

ANABEL. I dislike them extremely, Winifred.

WINIFRED. They're such a bore.

ANABEL. What does Gerald manage?

WINIFRED. Everything. You know he's revolutionised the collieries and
the whole Company. He's made a whole new thing of it, so MODERN. Father
says he almost wishes he'd let it die out--let the pits be closed. But
I suppose things MUST be modernised, don't you think? Though it's very
unpeaceful, you know, really.

ANABEL. Decidedly unpeaceful, I should say.

WINIFRED. The colliers work awfully hard. The pits are quite wonderful
now. Father says it's against nature--all this electricity and so on.
Gerald adores electricity. Isn't it curious?

ANABEL. Very. How are you getting on?

WINIFRED. I don't know. It's so hard to make things BALANCE as if they
were alive. Where IS the balance in a thing that's alive?

ANABEL. The poise? Yes, Winifred--to me, all the secret of life is in
that--just the--the inexpressible poise of a living thing, that makes
it so different from a dead thing. To me it's the soul, you know--all
living things have it--flowers, trees as well. It makes life always
marvellous.

WINIFRED. Ah, yes!--ah, yes! If only I could put it in my model.

ANABEL. I think you will. You are a sculptor, Winifred.--Isn't there
someone there?

WINIFRED (running to the door). Oh, Oliver!

OLIVER. Hello, Winnie! Can I come in? This is your sanctum: you can keep
us out if you like.

WINIFRED. Oh, no. Do you know Miss Wrath, Oliver? She's a famous
sculptress.

OLIVER. Is she? We have met.--Is Winifred going to make a sculptress, do
you think?

ANABEL. I do.

OLIVER. Good! I like your studio, Winnie. Awfully nice up here over the
out-buildings. Are you happy in it?

WINIFRED. Yes, I'm perfectly happy--only I shall NEVER be able to make
real models, Oliver--it's so difficult.

OLIVER. Fine room for a party--Give us a studio party one day, Win, and
we'll dance.

WINIFRED (flying to him). Yes, Oliver, do let us dance. What shall we
dance to?

OLIVER. Dance?--Dance _Vigni-vignons_--we all know that. Ready?

WINIFRED. Yes.


(They begin to sing, dancing meanwhile, in a free little ballet-manner,
a wine-dance, dancing separate and then together.)


          De terre en vigne,
          La voila la jolie vigne,
          Vigni-vignons--vignons le vin,
          La voila la jolie vigne au vin,
          La voila la jolie vigne.


OLIVER. Join in--join in, all.


(ANABEL joins in; the three dance and move in rhythm.)


WINIFRED. I love it--I love it! Do _Ma capote a trois boutons_--you know
it, don't you, Anabel? Ready--now---


(They begin to dance to a quick little march-rhythm, all singing and
     dancing till they are out of breath.)


OLIVER. Oh!--tired!--let us sit down.

WINIFRED. Oliver!--oh, Oliver!--I LOVE you and Anabel.

OLIVER. Oh, Winifred, I brought you a present--you'll love me more now.

WINIFRED. Yes, I shall. Do give it me.

OLIVER. I left it in the morning-room. I put it on the mantel-piece for
you.

WINIFRED. Shall I go for it?

OLIVER. There it is, if you want it.

WINIFRED. Yes--do you mind? I won't be long. (Exit.)

OLIVER. She's a nice child.

ANABEL. A VERY nice child.

OLIVER. Why did you come back, Anabel?

ANABEL. Why does the moon rise, Oliver?

OLIVER. For some mischief or other, so they say.

ANABEL. You think I came back for mischief's sake?

OLIVER. Did you?

ANABEL. No.

OLIVER. Ah!

ANABEL. Tell me, Oliver, how is everything now?--how is it with
you?--how is it between us all?

OLIVER. How is it between us all?--How ISN'T it, is more the mark.

ANABEL. Why?

OLIVER. You made a fool of us.

ANABEL. Of whom?

OLIVER. Well--of Gerald particularly--and of me.

ANABEL. How did I make a fool of you, Oliver?

OLIVER. That you know best, Anabel.

ANABEL. No, I don't know. Was it ever right between Gerald and me, all
the three years we knew each other--we were together?

OLIVER. Was it all wrong?

ANABEL. No, not all. But it was terrible. It was terrible, Oliver. You
don't realise. You don't realise how awful passion can be, when it never
resolves, when it never becomes anything else. It is hate, really.

OLIVER. What did you want the passion to resolve into?

ANABEL. I was blinded--maddened. Gerald stung me and stung me till I
was mad. I left him for reason's sake, for sanity's sake. We should have
killed one another.

OLIVER. You, stung him, too, you know--and pretty badly, at the last:
you dehumanised him.

ANABEL. When? When I left him, you mean?

OLIVER. Yes, when you went away with that Norwegian--playing your game a
little too far.

ANABEL. Yes, I knew you'd blame me. I knew you'd be against me. But
don't you see, Oliver, you helped to make it impossible for us.

OLIVER. Did I? I didn't intend to.

ANABEL. Ha, ha, Oliver! Your good intentions! They are too good to
bear investigation, my friend. Ah, but for your good and friendly
intentions---

OLIVER. You mean my friendship with Gerald went against you?

ANABEL. Yes. And your friendship with me went against Gerald.

OLIVER. So I am the devil in the piece.

ANABEL. You see, Oliver, Gerald loved you far too well ever to love me
altogether. He loved us both. But the Gerald that loved you so dearly,
old, old friends as you were, and TRUSTED you, he turned a terrible face
of contempt on me. You don't know, Oliver, the cold edge of Gerald's
contempt for me--because he was so secure and strong in his old
friendship with you. You don't know his sneering attitude to me in the
deepest things with you. He had a passion for me. But he loved you.

OLIVER. Well, he doesn't any more. We went apart after you had gone. The
friendship has become almost casual.

ANABEL. You see how bitterly you speak.

OLIVER. Yet you didn't hate me, Anabel.

ANABEL. No, Oliver--I was AWFULLY fond of you. I trusted you--and I
trust you still. You see I knew how fond Gerald was of you. And I had
to respect this feeling. So I HAD to be aware of you: and I HAD to be
conscious of you: in a way, I had to love you. You understand how I
mean? Not with the same fearful love with which I loved Gerald. You
seemed to me warm and protecting--like a brother, you know--but a
brother one LOVES.

OLIVER. And then you hated me?

ANABEL. Yes, I had to hate you.

OLIVER. And you hated Gerald?

ANABEL. Almost to madness--almost to madness.

OLIVER. Then you went away with that Norwegian. What of him?

ANABEL. What of him? Well, he's dead.

OLIVER. Ah! That's why you came back?

ANABEL. No, no. I came back because my only hope in life was in coming
back. Baard was beautiful--and awful. You know how glisteningly blond he
was. Oliver, have you ever watched the polar bears? He was cold as iron
when it is so cold that it burns you. Coldness wasn't negative with him.
It was positive--and awful beyond expression--like the aurora borealis.

OLIVER. I wonder you ever got back.

ANABEL. Yes, so do I. I feel as if I'd fallen down a fissure in the ice.
Yet I have come back, haven't I?

OLIVER. God knows! At least, Anabel, we've gone through too much ever to
start the old game again. There'll be no more sticky love between us.

ANABEL. No, I think there won't, either.

OLIVER. And what of Gerald?

ANABEL. I don't know. What do you think of him?

OLIVER. I can't think any more. I can only blindly go from day to day,
now.

ANABEL. So can I. Do you think I was wrong to come back? Do you think I
wrong Gerald?

OLIVER. No. I'm glad you came. But I feel I can't KNOW anything. We must
just go on.

ANABEL. Sometimes I feel I ought never to have come to Gerald
again--never--never--never.

OLIVER. Just left the gap?--Perhaps, if everything has to come asunder.
But I think, if ever there is to be life--hope,--then you had to come
back. I always knew it. There is something eternal between you and him;
and if there is to be any happiness, it depends on that. But perhaps
there is to BE no happiness--for our part of the world.

ANABEL (after a pause). Yet I feel hope--don't you?

OLIVER. Yes, sometimes.

ANABEL. It seemed to me, especially that winter in Norway,--I can hardly
express it,--as if any moment life might give way under one, like thin
ice, and one would be more than dead. And then I knew my only hope was
here--the only hope.

OLIVER. Yes, I believe it. And I believe---


(Enter MRS. BARLOW.)


MRS. BARLOW. Oh, I wanted to speak to you, Oliver.

OLIVER. Shall I come across?

MRS. BARLOW. No, not now. I believe father is coming here with Gerald.

OLIVER. Is he going to walk so far?

MRS. BARLOW. He will do it.--I suppose you know Oliver?

ANABEL. Yes, we have met before.

MRS. BARLOW (to OLIVER). You didn't mention it. Where have you met Miss
Wrath? She's been about the world, I believe.

ANABEL. About the world?--no, Mrs. Barlow. If one happens to know Paris
and London---

MRS. BARLOW. Paris and London! Well, I don't say you are all together
an adventuress. My husband seems very pleased with you--for Winifred's
sake, I suppose--and he's wrapped up in Winifred.

ANABEL. Winifred is an artist.

MRS. BARLOW. All my children have the artist in them. They get it from
my family. My father went mad in Rome. My family is born with a black
fate--they all inherit it.

OLIVER. I believe one is master of one's fate sometimes, Mrs. Barlow.
There are moments of pure choice.

MRS. BARLOW. Between two ways to the same end, no doubt. There's no
changing the end.

OLIVER. I think there is.

MRS. BARLOW. Yes, you have a _parvenu's_ presumptuousness somewhere
about you.

OLIVER. Well, better than a blue-blooded fatalism.

MRS. BARLOW. The fate is in the blood: you can't change the blood.


(Enter WINIFRED.)


WINIFRED. Oh, thank you, Oliver, for the wolf and the goat, thank you so
much!--The wolf has sprung on the goat, Miss Wrath, and has her by the
throat.

ANABEL. The wolf?

OLIVER. It's a little marble group--Italian--in hard marble.

WINIFRED. The wolf--I love the wolf--he pounces so beautifully. His
backbone is so terribly fierce. I don't feel a bit sorry for the goat,
somehow.

OLIVER. I didn't. She is too much like the wrong sort of clergyman.

WINIFRED. Yes--such a stiff, long face. I wish he'd kill her.

MRS. BARLOW. There's a wish!

WINIFRED. Father and Gerald are coming. That's them, I suppose.


(Enter MR. BARLOW and GERALD.)


MR. BARLOW. Ah, good morning--good morning--quite a little gathering!
Ah---

OLIVER. The steps tire you, Mr. Barlow.

MR. BARLOW. A little--a little--thank you.--Well, Miss Wrath, are you
quite comfortable here?

ANABEL. Very comfortable, thanks.

GERALD. It was clever of you, father, to turn this place into a studio.

MR. BARLOW. Yes, Gerald. You make the worldly schemes, and I the homely.
Yes, it's a delightful place. I shall come here often if the two young
ladies will allow me.--By the way, Miss Wrath, I don't know if you
have been introduced to my son Gerald. I beg your pardon. Miss Wrath,
Gerald--my son, Miss Wrath. (They bow.) Well, we are quite a gathering,
quite a pleasant little gathering. We never expected anything so
delightful a month ago, did we, Winifred, darling?

WINIFRED. No, daddy, it's much nicer than expectations.

MR. BARLOW. So it is, dear--to have such exceptional companionship
and such a pleasant retreat. We are very happy to have Miss Wrath with
us--very happy.

GERALD. A studio's awfully nice, you know; it is such a retreat. A
newspaper has no effect in it--falls quite flat, no matter what the
headlines are.

MR. BARLOW. Quite true, Gerald, dear. It is a sanctum the world cannot
invade--unlike all other sanctuaries, I am afraid.

GERALD. By the way, Oliver--to go back to profanities--the colliers
really are coming out in support of the poor, ill-used clerks.

MR. BARLOW. No, no, Gerald--no, no! Don't be such an alarmist. Let us
leave these subjects before the ladies. No, no: the clerks will have
their increase quite peacefully.

GERALD. Yes, dear father--but they can't have it peacefully now. We've
been threatened already by the colliers--we've already received an
ultimatum.

MR. BARLOW. Nonsense, my boy--nonsense! Don't let us split words. You
won't go against the clerks in such a small matter. Always avoid trouble
over small matters. Don't make bad feeling--don't make bad blood.

MRS. BARLOW. The blood is already rotten in the neighbourhood. What
it needs is letting out. We need a few veins opening, or we shall have
mortification setting in. The blood is black.

MR. BARLOW. We won't accept your figure of speech literally, dear. No,
Gerald, don't go to war over trifles.

GERALD. It's just over trifles that one must make war, father. One can
yield gracefully over big matters. But to be bullied over trifles is a
sign of criminal weakness.

MR. BARLOW. Ah, not so, not so, my boy. When you are as old as I am, you
will know the comparative insignificance of these trifles.

GERALD. The older _I_ get, father, the more such trifles stick in my
throat.

MR. BARLOW. Ah, it is an increasingly irritable disposition in you, my
child. Nothing costs so bitterly, in the end, as a stubborn pride.

MRS. BARLOW. Except a stubborn humility--and that will cost you
more. Avoid humility, beware of stubborn humility: it degrades. Hark,
Gerald--fight! When the occasion comes, fight! If it's one against five
thousand, fight! Don't give them your heart on a dish! Never! If they
want to eat your heart out, make them fight for it, and then give it
them poisoned at last, poisoned with your own blood.--What do you say,
young woman?

ANABEL. Is it for me to speak, Mrs. Barlow?

MRS. BARLOW. Weren't you asked?

ANABEL. Certainly I would NEVER give the world my heart on a dish. But
can't there ever be peace--real peace?

MRS. BARLOW. No--not while there is devilish enmity.

MR. BARLOW. You are wrong, dear, you are wrong. The peace can come, the
peace that passeth all understanding.

MRS. BARLOW. That there is already between me and Almighty God. I am
at peace with the God that made me, and made me proud. With men who
humiliate me I am at war. Between me and the shameful humble there
is war to the end, though they are millions and I am one. I hate the
people. Between my race and them and my children--for ever war, for ever
and ever.

MR. BARLOW. Ah, Henrietta--you have said all this before.

MRS. BARLOW. And say it again. Fight, Gerald. You have my blood in you,
thank God. Fight for it, Gerald. Spend it as if it were costly, Gerald,
drop by drop. Let no dogs lap it.--Look at your father. He set his heart
on a plate at the door, for the poorest mongrel to eat up. See him now,
wasted and crossed out like a mistake--and swear, Gerald, swear to be
true to my blood in you. Never lie down before the mob, Gerald. Fight it
and stab it, and die fighting. It's a lost hope--but fight!

GERALD. Don't say these things here, mother.

MRS. BARLOW. Yes, I will--I will. I'll say them before you, and the
child Winifred--she knows. And before Oliver and the young woman--they
know, too.

MR. BARLOW. You see, dear, you can never understand that, although I
am weak and wasted, although I may be crossed out from the world like a
mistake, I still have peace in my soul, dear, the peach that passeth all
understanding.

MRS. BARLOW. And what right have you to it? All very well for you to
take peace with you into the other world. What do you leave for your
sons to inherit?

MR. BARLOW. The peace of God, Henrietta, if there is no peace among men.

MRS. BARLOW. Then why did you have children? Why weren't you celibate?
They have to live among men. If they have no place among men, why have
you put them there? If the peace of God is no more than the peace of
death, why are your sons born of you? How can you have peace with God,
if you leave no peace for your sons--no peace, no pride, no place on
earth?

GERALD. Nay, mother, nay. You shall never blame father on my behalf.

MRS. BARLOW. Don't trouble--he is blameless--I, a hulking, half-demented
woman, I am GLAD when you blame me. But don't blame me when I tell you
to fight. Don't do that, or you will regret it when you must die. Ah,
your father was stiff and proud enough before men of better rank than
himself. He was overbearing enough with his equals and his betters. But
he humbled himself before the poor, he made me ashamed. He must hear
it--he must hear it! Better he should hear it than die coddling himself
with peace. His humility, and my pride, they have made a nice ruin of
each other. Yet he is the man I wanted to marry--he is the man I
would marry again. But never, never again would I give way before his
goodness. Gerald, if you must be true to your father, be true to me as
well. Don't set me down at nothing because I haven't a humble case.

GERALD. No, mother--no, dear mother. You see, dear mother, I have rather
a job between the two halves of myself. When you come to have the wild
horses in your own soul, mother, it makes it difficult.

MRS. BARLOW. Never mind, you'll have help.

GERALD. Thank you for the assurance, darling.--Father, you don't mind
what mother says, I hope. I believe there's some truth in it--don't you?

MR. BARLOW. I have nothing to say.

WINIFRED. _I_ think there's some truth in it, daddy. You were always
worrying about those horrid colliers, and they didn't care a bit about
you. And they OUGHT to gave cared a million pounds.

MR. BARLOW. You don't understand, my child.


(Curtain.)




ACT II


     SCENE: Evening of the same day. Drawing-room at Lilly Close. MR.
     BARLOW, GERALD, WINIFRED, ANABEL OLIVER present. Butler pours
     coffee.


MR. BARLOW. And you are quite a stranger in these parts, Miss Wrath?

ANABEL. Practically. But I was born at Derby.

MR. BARLOW. I was born in this house--but it was a different affair
then: my father was a farmer, you know. The coal has brought us
what moderate wealth we have. Of course, we were never poor or
needy--farmers, substantial farmers. And I think we were happier
so--yes.--Winnie, dear, hand Miss Wrath the sweets. I hope they're good.
I ordered them from London for you.--Oliver, my boy, have you everything
you like? That's right.--It gives me such pleasure to see a little
festive gathering in this room again. I wish Bertie and Elinor might be
here. What time is it, Gerald?

GERALD. A quarter to nine, father.

MR. BARLOW. Not late yet. I can sit with you another half-hour. I am
feeling better to-day. Winifred, sing something for us.

WINIFRED. Something jolly, father?

MR. BARLOW. Very jolly, darling.

WINIFRED. I'll sing "The Lincolnshire Poacher," shall I?

MR. BARLOW. Do, darling, and we'll all join in the chorus.--Will you
join in the chorus, Miss Wrath?

ANABEL. I will. It is a good song.

MR. BARLOW. Yes, isn't it!

WINIFRED. All dance for the chorus, as well as singing.


(They sing; some pirouette a little for the chorus.)


MR. BARLOW. Ah, splendid! Splendid! There is nothing like gaiety.

WINIFRED. I do love to dance about. I know: let us do a little
ballet--four of us--oh, do!

GERALD. What ballet, Winifred?

WINIFRED. Any. Eva can play for us. She plays well.

MR. BARLOW. You won't disturb your mother? Don't disturb Eva if she
is busy with your mother. (Exit WINIFRED.) If only I can see Winifred
happy, my heart is at rest: if only I can hope for her to be happy in
her life.

GERALD. Oh, Winnie's all right, father--especially now she has Miss
Wrath to initiate her into the mysteries of life and labour.

ANABEL. Why are you ironical?

MR. BARLOW. Oh, Miss Wrath, believe me, we all feel that--it is the
greatest possible pleasure to me that you have come.

GERALD. I wasn't ironical, I assure you.

MR. BARLOW. No, indeed--no, indeed! We have every belief in you.

ANABEL. But why should you have?

MR. BARLOW. Ah, my dear child, allow us the credit of our own
discernment. And don't take offence at my familiarity. I am afraid I am
spoilt since I am an invalid.


(Re-enter WINIFRED, with EVA.)


MR. BARLOW. Come, Eva, you will excuse us for upsetting your evening.
Will you be so good as to play something for us to dance to?

EVA. Yes, sir. What shall I play?

WINIFRED. Mozart--I'll find you the piece. Mozart's the saddest musician
in the world--but he's the best to dance to.

MR. BARLOW. Why, how is it you are such a connoisseur in sadness,
darling?

GERALD. She isn't. She's a flagrant amateur.


(EVA plays; they dance a little ballet.)


MR. BARLOW. Charming--charming, Miss Wrath:--will you allow me to
say _Anabel_, we shall all feel so much more at home? Yes--thank
you--er--you enter into the spirit of it wonderfully, Anabel, dear. The
others are accustomed to play together. But it is not so easy to come in
on occasion as you do.

GERALD. Oh, Anabel's a genius!--I beg your pardon, Miss
Wrath--familiarity is catching.

MR. BARLOW. Gerald, my boy, don't forget that you are virtually host
here.

EVA. Did you want any more music, sir?

GERALD. No, don't stay, Eva. We mustn't tire father. (Exit EVA.)

MR. BARLOW. I am afraid, Anabel, you will have a great deal to excuse
in us, in the way of manners. We have never been a formal household. But
you have lived in the world of artists: you will understand, I hope.

ANABEL. Oh, surely---

MR. BARLOW. Yes, I know. We have been a turbulent family, and we have
had our share of sorrow, even more, perhaps, than of joys. And sorrow
makes one indifferent to the conventionalities of life.

GERALD. Excuse me, father: do you mind if I go and write a letter I have
on my conscience?

MR. BARLOW. No, my boy. (Exit GERALD.) We have had our share of sorrow
and of conflict, Miss Wrath, as you may have gathered.

ANABEL. Yes--a little.

MR. BARLOW. The mines were opened when my father was a boy--the
first--and I was born late, when he was nearly fifty. So that all my
life has been involved with coal and colliers. As a young man, I was
gay and thoughtless. But I married young, and we lost our first child
through a terrible accident. Two children we have lost through sudden
and violent death. (WINIFRED goes out unnoticed.) It made me reflect.
And when I came to reflect, Anabel, I could not justify my position in
life. If I believed in the teachings of the New Testament--which I
did, and do--how could I keep two or three thousand men employed and
underground in the mines, at a wage, let us say, of two pounds a week,
whilst I lived in this comfortable house, and took something like two
thousand pounds a year--let us name any figure---

ANABEL. Yes, of course. But is it money that really matters, Mr. Barlow?

MR. BARLOW. My dear, if you are a working man, it matters. When I
went into the homes of my poor fellows, when they were ill or had had
accidents--then I knew it mattered. I knew that the great disparity was
wrong--even as we are taught that it is wrong.

ANABEL. Yes, I believe that the great disparity is a mistake. But take
their lives, Mr. Barlow. Do you thing they would LIVE more, if they had
more money? Do you think the poor live less than the rich?--is their
life emptier?

MR. BARLOW. Surely their lives would be better, Anabel.

OLIVER. All our lives would be better, if we hadn't to hang on in
the perpetual tug-of-war, like two donkeys pulling at one carrot. The
ghastly tension of possessions, and struggling for possession, spoils
life for everybody.

MR. BARLOW. Yes, I know now, as I knew then, that it was wrong. But
how to avoid the wrong? If I gave away the whole of my income, it would
merely be an arbitrary dispensation of charity. The money would still be
mine to give, and those that received it would probably only be weakened
instead of strengthened. And then my wife was accustomed to a certain
way of living, a certain establishment. Had I any right to sacrifice
her, without her consent?

ANABEL. Why, no!

MR. BARLOW. Again, if I withdrew from the Company, if I retired on a
small income, I knew that another man would automatically take my place,
and make it probably harder for the men.

ANABEL. Of course--while the system stands, if one makes self-sacrifice
one only panders to the system, makes it fatter.

MR. BARLOW. One panders to the system--one panders to the system. And
so, you see, the problem is too much. One man cannot alter or affect the
system; he can only sacrifice himself to it. Which is the worst thing
probably that he can do.

OLIVER. Quite. But why feel guilty for the system?--everybody supports
it, the poor as much as the rich. If every rich man withdrew from the
system, the working class and socialists would keep it going, every man
in the hope of getting rich himself at last. It's the people that are
wrong. They want the system much more than the rich do--because they are
much more anxious to be rich--never having been rich, poor devils.

MR. BARLOW. Just the system. So I decided at last that the best way was
to give every private help that lay in my power. I would help my men
individually and personally, wherever I could. Not one of them came
to me and went away unheard; and there was no distress which could be
alleviated that I did not try to alleviate. Yet I am afraid that the
greatest distress I never heard of, the most distressed never came to
me. They hid their trouble.

ANABEL. Yes, the decent ones.

MR. BARLOW. But I wished to help--it was my duty. Still, I think that,
on the whole, we were a comfortable and happy community. Barlow &
Walsall's men were not unhappy in those days, I believe. We were
liberal; the men lived.

OLIVER. Yes, that is true. Even twenty years ago the place was still
jolly.

MR. BARLOW. And then, when Gerald was a lad of thirteen, came the great
lock-out. We belonged to the Masters' Federation--I was but one man on
the Board. We had to abide by the decision. The mines were closed till
the men would accept the reduction.--Well, that cut my life across. We
were shutting the men out from work, starving their families, in order
to force them to accept a reduction. It may be the condition of
trade made it imperative. But, for myself, I would rather have
lost everything.--Of course, we did what we could. Food was very
cheap--practically given away. We had open kitchen here. And it was
mercifully warm summer-time. Nevertheless, there was privation and
suffering, and trouble and bitterness. We had the redcoats down--even
to guard this house. And from this window I saw Whatmore head-stocks
ablaze, and before I could get to the spot the soldiers had shot two
poor fellows. They were not killed, thank God---

OLIVER. Ah, but they enjoyed it--they enjoyed it immensely. I remember
what grand old sporting weeks they were. It was like a fox-hunt,
so lively and gay--bands and tea-parties and excitement everywhere,
pit-ponies loose, men all over the country-side---

MR. BARLOW. There was a great deal of suffering, which you were too
young to appreciate. However, since that year I have had to acknowledge
a new situation--a radical if unspoken opposition between masters and
men. Since that year we have been split into opposite camps. Whatever I
might privately feel, I was one of the owners, one of the masters,
and therefore in the opposite camp. To my men I was an oppressor, a
representative of injustice and greed. Privately, I like to think that
even to this day they bear me no malice, that they have some lingering
regard for me. But the master stands before the human being, and the
condition of war overrides individuals--they hate the master, even
whilst, as a human being, he would be their friend. I recognise the
inevitable justice. It is the price one has to pay.

ANABEL. Yes, it is difficult--very.

MR. BARLOW. Perhaps I weary you?

ANABEL. Oh, no--no.

MR. BARLOW. Well--then the mines began to pay badly. The seams ran thin
and unprofitable, work was short. Either we must close down or introduce
a new system, American methods, which I dislike so extremely. Now it
really became a case of men working against machines, flesh and blood
working against iron, for a livelihood. Still, it had to be done--the
whole system revolutionised. Gerald took it in hand--and now I hardly
know my own pits, with the great electric plants and strange
machinery, and the new coal-cutters--iron men, as the colliers call
them--everything running at top speed, utterly dehumanised, inhuman.
Well, it had to be done; it was the only alternative to closing down and
throwing three thousand men out of work. And Gerald has done it. But I
can't bear to see it. The men of this generation are not like my men.
They are worn and gloomy; they have a hollow look that I can't bear
to see. They are a great grief to me. I remember men even twenty years
ago--a noisy, lively, careless set, who kept the place ringing. I feel
it is unnatural; I feel afraid of it. And I cannot help feeling guilty.

ANABEL. Yes--I understand. It terrifies me.

MR. BARLOW. Does it?--does it?--Yes.--And as my wife says, I leave it
all to Gerald--this terrible situation. But I appeal to God, if anything
in my power could have averted it, I would have averted it. I would have
made any sacrifice. For it is a great and bitter trouble to me.

ANABEL. Ah, well, in death there is no industrial situation. Something
must be different there.

MR. BARLOW. Yes--yes.

OLIVER. And you see sacrifice isn't the slightest use. If only people
would be sane and decent.

MR. BARLOW. Yes, indeed.--Would you be so good as to ring, Oliver? I
think I must go to bed.

ANABEL. Ah, you have over-tired yourself.

MR. BARLOW. No, my dear--not over-tired. Excuse me if I have burdened
you with all this. I relieves me to speak of it.

ANABEL. I realise HOW terrible it is, Mr. Barlow--and how helpless one
is.

MR. BARLOW. Thank you, my dear, for your sympathy.

OLIVER. If the people for one minute pulled themselves up and conquered
their mania for money and machine excitement, the whole thing would be
solved.--Would you like me to find Winnie and tell her to say good night
to you?

MR. BARLOW. If you would be so kind. (Exit OLIVER.) Can't you find
a sweet that you would like, my dear? Won't you take a little cherry
brandy?


(Enter BUTLER.)


ANABEL. Thank you.

WILLIAM. You will go up, sir?

MR. BARLOW. Yes, William.

WILLIAM. You are tired to-night, sir.

MR. BARLOW. It has come over me just now.

WILLIAM. I wish you went up before you became so over-tired, sir. Would
you like nurse?

MR. BARLOW. No, I'll go with you, William. Good night, my dear.

ANABEL. Good night, Mr. Barlow. I am so sorry if you are over-tired.

     (Exit BUTLER and MR. BARLOW.  ANABEL takes a drink and goes to
     the fire.)


(Enter GERALD.)


GERALD. Father gone up?

ANABEL. Yes.

GERALD. I thought I heard him. Has he been talking too much?--Poor
father, he will take things to heart.

ANABEL. Tragic, really.

GERALD. Yes, I suppose it is. But one can get beyond tragedy--beyond the
state of feeling tragical, I mean. Father himself is tragical. One feels
he is mistaken--and yet he wouldn't be any different, and be himself, I
suppose. He's sort of crucified on an idea of the working people. It's
rather horrible when he's one's father.--However, apart from tragedy,
how do you like being here, in this house?

ANABEL. I like the house. It's rather too comfortable.

GERALD. Yes. But how do you like being here?

ANABEL. How do you like my being in your home?

GERALD. Oh, I think you're very decorative.

ANABEL. More decorative than comfortable?

GERALD. Perhaps. But perhaps you give the necessary finish to the
establishment.

ANABEL. Like the correct window-curtains?

GERALD. Yes, something like that. I say, why did you come, Anabel? Why
did you come slap-bang into the middle of us?--It's not expostulation--I
want to know.

ANABEL. You mean you want to be told?

GERALD. Yes, I want to be told.

ANABEL. That's rather mean of you. You should savvy, and let it go
without saying.

GERALD. Yes, but I don't savvy.

ANABEL. Then wait till you do.

GERALD. No, I want to be told. There's a difference in you, Anabel, that
puts me out, rather. You're sort of softer and sweeter--I'm not sure
whether it isn't a touch of father in you. There's a little sanctified
smudge on your face. Are you really a bit sanctified?

ANABEL. No, not sanctified. It's true I feel different. I feel I want
a new way of life--something more dignified, more religious, if you
like--anyhow, something POSITIVE.

GERALD. Is it the change of heart, Anabel?

ANABEL. Perhaps it is, Gerald.

GERALD. I'm not sure that I like it. Isn't it like a berry that decides
to get very sweet, and goes soft?

ANABEL. I don't think so.

GERALD. Slightly sanctimonious. I think I liked you better before. I
don't think I like you with this touch of aureole. People seem to me so
horribly self-satisfied when they get a change of heart--they take such
a fearful lot of credit to themselves on the strength of it.

ANABEL. I don't think I do.--Do you feel no different, Gerald?

GERALD. Radically, I can't say I do. I feel very much more INdifferent.

ANABEL. What to?

GERALD. Everything.

ANABEL. You're still angry--that's what it is.

GERALD. Oh, yes, I'm angry. But that is part of my normal state.

ANABEL. Why are you angry?

GERALD. Is there any reason why I shouldn't be angry? I'm angry because
you treated me--well, so impudently, really--clearing out and leaving
one to whistle to the empty walls.

ANABEL. Don't you think it was time I cleared out, when you became so
violent, and really dangerous, really like a madman?

GERALD. Time or not time, you went--you disappeared and left us high and
dry--and I am still angry.--But I'm not only angry about that. I'm angry
with the colliers, with Labour for its low-down impudence--and I'm angry
with father for being so ill--and I'm angry with mother for looking such
a hopeless thing--and I'm angry with Oliver because he thinks so much---

ANABEL. And what are you angry with yourself for?

GERALD. I'm angry with myself for being myself--I always was that. I was
always a curse to myself.

ANABEL. And that's why you curse others so much?

GERALD. You talk as if butter wouldn't melt in your mouth.

ANABEL. You see, Gerald, there has to be a change. You'll have to
change.

GERALD. Change of heart?--Well, it won't be to get softer, Anabel.

ANABEL. You needn't be softer. But you can be quieter, more sane even.
There ought to be some part of you that can be quiet and apart from the
world, some part that can be happy and gentle.

GERALD. Well, there isn't. I don't pretend to be able to extricate a
soft sort of John Halifax, Gentleman, out of the machine I'm mixed up
in, and keep him to gladden the connubial hearth. I'm angry, and I'm
angry right through, and I'm not going to play bo-peep with myself,
pretending not to be.

ANABEL. Nobody asks you to. But is there no part of you that can be a
bit gentle and peaceful and happy with a woman?

GERALD. No, there isn't.--I'm not going to smug with you--no, not I.
You're smug in your coming back. You feel virtuous, and expect me to
rise to it. I won't.

ANABEL. Then I'd better have stayed away.

GERALD. If you want me to virtuise and smug with you, you had.

ANABEL. What DO you want, then?

GERALD. I don't know. I know I don't want THAT.

ANABEL. Oh, very well. (Goes to the piano; begins to play.)


(Enter MRS. BARLOW.)


GERALD. Hello, mother! Father HAS gone to bed.

MRS. BARLOW. Oh, I thought he was down here talking. You two alone?

GERALD. With the piano for chaperone, mother.

MRS. BARLOW. That's more than I gave you credit for. I haven't come to
chaperone you either, Gerald.

GERALD. Chaperone ME, mother! Do you think I need it?

MRS. BARLOW. If you do, you won't get it. I've come too late to be of
any use in that way, as far as I hear.

GERALD. What have you heard, mother?

MRS. BARLOW. I heard Oliver and this young woman talking.

GERALD. Oh, did you? When? What did they say?

MRS. BARLOW. Something about married in the sight of heaven, but
couldn't keep it up on earth.

GERALD. I don't understand.

MRS. BARLOW. That you and this young woman were married in the sight of
heaven, or through eternity, or something similar, but that you couldn't
make up your minds to it on earth.

GERALD. Really! That's very curious, mother.

MRS. BARLOW. Very common occurrence, I believe.

GERALD. Yes, so it is. But I don't think you heard quite right, dear.
There seems to be some lingering uneasiness in heaven, as a matter of
fact. We'd quite made up our minds to live apart on earth. But where did
you hear this, mother?

MRS. BARLOW. I heard it outside the studio door this morning.

GERALD. You mean you happened to be on one side of the door while Oliver
and Anabel were talking on the other?

MRS. BARLOW. You'd make a detective, Gerald--you're so good at putting
two and two together. I listened till I'd heard as much as I wanted.
I'm not sure I didn't come down here hoping to hear another conversation
going on.

GERALD. Listen outside the door, darling?

MRS. BARLOW. There'd be nothing to listen to if I were inside.

GERALD. It isn't usually done, you know.

MRS. BARLOW. I listen outside doors when I have occasion to be
interested--which isn't often, unfortunately for me.

GERALD. But I've a queer feeling that you have a permanent occasion to
be interested in me. I only half like it.

MRS. BARLOW. It's surprising how uninteresting you are, Gerald, for a
man of your years. I have not had occasion to listen outside a door, for
you, no, not for a great while, believe me.

GERALD. I believe you implicitly, darling. But do you happen to know
me through and through, and in and out, all my past and present doings,
mother? Have you a secret access to my room, and a spy-hole, and all
those things? This is uncomfortably thrilling. You take on a new lustre.

MRS. BARLOW. Your memoirs wouldn't make you famous, my son.

GERALD. Infamous, dear?

MRS. BARLOW. Good heavens, no! What a lot you expect from your very mild
sins! You and this young woman have lived together, then?

GERALD. Don't say "this young woman," mother dear--it's slightly vulgar.
It isn't for me to compromise Anabel by admitting such a thing, you
know.

MRS. BARLOW. Do you ask me to call her Anabel? I won't.

GERALD. Then say "this person," mother. It's more becoming.

MRS. BARLOW. I didn't come to speak to you, Gerald. I know you. I came
to speak to this young woman.

GERALD. "Person," mother.--Will you curtsey, Anabel? And I'll twist my
handkerchief. We shall make a Cruikshank drawing, if mother makes her
hair a little more slovenly.

MRS. BARLOW. You and Gerald were together for some time?

GERALD. Three years, off and on, mother.

MRS. BARLOW. And then you suddenly dropped my son, and went away?

GERALD. To Norway, mother--so I have gathered.

MRS. BARLOW. And now you have come back because that last one died?

GERALD. Is he dead, Anabel? How did he die?

ANABEL. He was killed on the ice.

GERALD. Oh, God!

MRS. BARLOW. Now, having had your fill of tragedy, you have come back to
be demure and to marry Gerald. Does he thank you?

GERALD. You must listen outside the door, mother, to find that out.

MRS. BARLOW. Well, it's your own affair.

GERALD. What a lame summing up, mother!--quite unworthy of you.

ANABEL. What did you wish to say to me, Mrs. Barlow? Please say it.

MRS. BARLOW. What did I wish to say! Ay, what did I wish to say! What
is the use of my saying anything? What am I but a buffoon and a slovenly
caricature in the family?

GERALD. No, mother dear, don't climb down--please don't. Tell Anabel
what you wanted to say.

MRS. BARLOW. Yes--yes--yes. I came to say--don't be good to my
son--don't be too good to him.

GERALD. Sounds weak, dear--mere contrariness.

MRS. BARLOW. Don't presume to be good to my son, young woman. I won't
have it, even if he will. You hear me?

ANABEL. Yes. I won't presume, then.

GERALD. May she presume to be bad to me, mother?

MRS. BARLOW. For that you may look after yourself.--But a woman who was
good to him would ruin him in six months, take the manhood out of him.
He has a tendency, a secret hankering, to make a gift of himself to
somebody. He sha'n't do it. I warn you. I am not a woman to be despised.

ANABEL. No--I understand.

MRS. BARLOW. Only one other thing I ask. If he must fight--and fight
he must--let him alone: don't you try to shield him or save him. DON'T
INTERFERE--do you hear?

ANABEL. Not till I must.

MRS. BARLOW. NEVER. Learn your place, and keep it. Keep away from him,
if you are going to be a wife to him. Don't go too near. And don't let
him come too near. Beat him off if he tries. Keep a solitude in your
heart even when you love him best. Keep it. If you lose it, you lose
everything.

GERALD. But that isn't love, mother.

MRS. BARLOW. What?

GERALD. That isn't love.

MRS. BARLOW. WHAT? What do you know of love, you ninny? You only know
the feeding-bottle. It's what you want, all of you--to be brought up by
hand, and mew about love. Ah, God!--Ah, God!--that you should none of
you know the only thing which would make you worth having.

GERALD. I don't believe in your only thing, mother. But what is it?

MRS. BARLOW. What you haven't got--the power to be alone.

GERALD. Sort of megalomania, you mean?

MRS. BARLOW. What? Megalomania! What is your LOVE but a megalomania,
flowing over everybody and everything like spilt water? Megalomania!
I hate you, you softy! I would BEAT you (suddenly advancing on him and
beating him fiercely)--beat you into some manhood--beat you---

GERALD. Stop, mother--keep off.

MRS. BARLOW. It's the men who need beating nowadays, not the children.
Beat the softness out of him, young woman. It's the only way, if you
love him enough--if you love him enough.

GERALD. You hear, Anabel?


          Speak roughly to your little boy,
          And beat him when he sneezes.


MRS. BARLOW (catching up a large old fan, and smashing it about his
head). You softy--you piffler--you will never have had enough! Ah, you
should be thrust in the fire, you should, to have the softness and the
brittleness burnt out of you!


    (The door opens--OLIVER TURTON enters, followed by JOB ARTHUR FREER.
     MRS. BARLOW is still attacking GERALD.  She turns, infuriated.)


Go out! Go out! What do you mean by coming in unannounced? Take him
upstairs--take that fellow into the library, Oliver Turton.

GERALD. Mother, you improve our already pretty reputation. Already they
say you are mad.

MRS. BARLOW (ringing violently). Let me be mad then. I am mad--driven
mad. One day I shall kill you, Gerald.

GERALD. You won't, mother because I sha'n't let you.

MRS. BARLOW. Let me!--let me! As if I should wait for you to let me!

GERALD. I am a match for you even in violence, come to that.

MRS. BARLOW. A match! A damp match. A wet match.


(Enter BUTLER.)


WILLIAM. You rang, madam?

MRS. BARLOW. Clear up those bits.--Where are you going to see that
white-faced fellow? Here?

GERALD. I think so.

MRS. BARLOW. You will STILL have them coming to the house, will you? You
will still let them trample in our private rooms, will you? Bah! I ought
to leave you to your own devices. (Exit.)

GERALD. When you've done that, William, ask Mr. Freer to come down here.

WILLIAM. Yes, sir. (A pause. Exit WILLIAM.)

GERALD. So-o-o. You've had another glimpse of the family life.

ANABEL. Yes. Rather--disturbing.

GERALD. Not at all, when you're used to it. Mother isn't as mad as she
pretends to be.

ANABEL. I don't think she's mad at all. I think she has most desperate
courage.

GERALD. "Courage" is good. That's a new term for it.

ANABEL. Yes, courage. When a man says "courage" he means the courage to
die. A woman means the courage to live. That's what women hate men most
for, that they haven't the courage to live.

GERALD. Mother takes her courage in both hands rather late.

ANABEL. We're a little late ourselves.

GERALD. We are, rather. By the way, you seem to have had plenty of
the courage of death--you've played a pretty deathly game, it seems to
me--both when I knew you and afterwards, you've had your finger pretty
deep in the death-pie.

ANABEL. That's why I want a change of--of---

GERALD. Of heart?--Better take mother's tip, and try the poker.

ANABEL. I will.

GERALD. Ha--corraggio!

ANABEL. Yes--corraggio!

GERALD. Corraggiaccio!

ANABEL. Corraggione!

GERALD. Cock-a-doodle-doo!


(Enter OLIVER and FREER.)


Oh, come in. Don't be afraid; it's a charade. (ANABEL rises.) No, don't
go, Anabel. Corraggio! Take a seat, Mr. Freer.

JOB ARTHUR. Sounds like a sneezing game, doesn't it?

GERALD. It is. Do you know the famous rhyme:


          Speak roughly to your little boy,
          And beat him when he sneezes?


JOB ARTHUR. No, I can't say I do.

GERALD. My mother does. Will you have anything to drink? Will you help
yourself?

JOB ARTHUR. Well--no--I don't think I'll have anything, thanks.

GERALD. A cherry brandy?--Yes?--Anabel, what's yours?

ANABEL. Did I see Kummel?

GERALD. You did. (They all take drinks.) What's the latest, Mr. Freer?

JOB ARTHUR. The latest? Well, I don't know, I'm sure---

GERALD. Oh, yes. Trot it out. We're quite private.

JOB ARTHUR. Well--I don't know. There's several things.

GERALD. The more the merrier.

JOB ARTHUR. I'm not so sure. The men are in a very funny temper, Mr.
Barlow--very funny.

GERALD. Coincidence--so am I. Not surprising, is it?

JOB ARTHUR. The men, perhaps not.

GERALD. What else, Job Arthur?

JOB ARTHUR. You know the men have decided to stand by the office men?

GERALD. Yes.

JOB ARTHUR. They've agreed to come out next Monday.

GERALD. Have they?

JOB ARTHUR. Yes; there was no stopping them. They decided for it like
one man.

GERALD. How was that?

JOB ARTHUR. That's what surprises me. They're a jolly sight more certain
over this than they've ever been over their own interests.

GERALD. All their love for the office clerks coming out in a rush?

JOB ARTHUR. Well, I don't know about love; but that's how it is.

GERALD. What is it, if it isn't love?

JOB ARTHUR. I can't say. They're in a funny temper. It's hard to make
out.

GERALD. A funny temper, are they? Then I suppose we ought to laugh.

JOB ARTHUR. No, I don't think it's a laughing matter. They're coming out
on Monday for certain.

GERALD. Yes--so are the daffodils.

JOB ARTHUR. Beg pardon?

GERALD. Daffodils.

JOB ARTHUR. No, I don't follow what you mean.

GERALD. Don't you? But I thought Alfred Breffitt and William Straw were
not very popular.

JOB ARTHUR. No, they aren't--not in themselves. But it's the principle
of the thing--so it seems.

GERALD. What principle?

JOB ARTHUR. Why, all sticking together, for one thing--all Barlow &
Walsall's men holding by one another.

GERALD. United we stand?

JOB ARTHUR. That's it. And then it's the strong defending the weak as
well. There's three thousand colliers standing up for thirty-odd office
men. I must say I think it's sporting myself.

GERALD. You do, do you? United we stand, divided we fall. What do they
stand for really? What is it?

JOB ARTHUR. Well--for their right to a living wage. That's how I see it.

GERALD. For their right to a living wage! Just that?

JOB ARTHUR. Yes, sir--that's how I see it.

GERALD. Well, that doesn't seem so preposterously difficult does it?

JOB ARTHUR. Why, that's what I think myself, Mr. Gerald. It's such a
little thing.

GERALD. Quite. I suppose the men themselves are to judge what is a
living wage?

JOB ARTHUR. Oh, I think they're quite reasonable, you know.

GERALD. Oh, yes, eminently reasonable. Reason's their strong point.--And
if they get their increase they'll be quite contented?

JOB ARTHUR. Yes, as far as I know, they will.

GERALD. As far as you know? Why, is there something you don't
know?--something you're not sure about?

JOB ARTHUR. No--I don't think so. I think they'll be quite satisfied
this time.

GERALD. Why this time? Is there going to be a next
time--every-day-has-its-to-morrow kind of thing?

JOB ARTHUR. I don't know about that. It's a funny world, Mr. Barlow.

GERALD. Yes, I quite believe it. How do you see it so funny?

JOB ARTHUR. Oh, I don't know. Everything's in a funny state.

GERALD. What do you mean by everything?

JOB ARTHUR. Well--I mean things in general--Labour, for example.

GERALD. You think Labour's in a funny state, do you? What do you think
it wants? What do you think, personally?

JOB ARTHUR. Well, in my own mind, I think it wants a bit of its own
back.

GERALD. And how does it mean to get it?

JOB ARTHUR. Ha! that's not so easy to say. But it means to have it, in
the long run.

GERALD. You mean by increasing demands for higher wages?

JOB ARTHUR. Yes, perhaps that's one road.

GERALD. Do you see any other?

JOB ARTHUR. Not just for the present.

GERALD. But later on?

JOB ARTHUR. I can't say about that. The men will be quiet enough for a
bit, if it's all right about the office men, you know.

GERALD. Probably. But have Barlow & Walsall's men any special grievance
apart from the rest of the miners?

JOB ARTHUR. I don't know. They've no liking for you, you know, sir.

GERALD. Why?

JOB ARTHUR. They think you've got a down on them.

GERALD. Why should they?

JOB ARTHUR. I don't know, sir; but they do.

GERALD. So they have a personal feeling against me? You don't think all
the colliers are the same, all over the country?

JOB ARTHUR. I think there's a good deal of feeling---

GERALD. Of wanting their own back?

JOB ARTHUR. That's it.

GERALD. But what can they do? I don't see what they can do. They can go
out on strike--but they've done that before, and the owners, at a pinch,
can stand it better than they can. As for the ruin of the industry,
if they do ruin it, it falls heaviest on them. In fact, it leaves them
destitute. There's nothing they can do, you know, that doesn't hit them
worse than it hits us.

JOB ARTHUR. I know there's something in that. But if they had a strong
man to lead them, you see---

GERALD. Yes, I've heard a lot about that strong man--but I've never come
across any signs of him, you know. I don't believe in one strong man
appearing out of so many little men. All men are pretty big in an age,
or in a movement, which produces a really big man. And Labour is a great
swarm of hopelessly little men. That's how I see it.

JOB ARTHUR. I'm not so sure about that.

GERALD. I am. Labour is a thing that can't have a head. It's a sort of
unwieldy monster that's bound to run its skull against the wall sooner
or later, and knock out what bit of brain it's got. You see, you need
wit and courage and real understanding if you're going to do anything
positive. And Labour has none of these things--certainly it shows no
signs of them.

JOB ARTHUR. Yes, when it has a chance, I think you'll see plenty of
courage and plenty of understanding.

GERALD. It always had a chance. And where one sees a bit of courage,
there's no understanding; and where there's some understanding, there's
absolutely no courage. It's hopeless, you know--it would be far best if
they'd all give it up, and try a new line.

JOB ARTHUR. I don't think they will.

GERALD. No, I don't, either. They'll make a mess and when they've made
it, they'll never get out of it. They can't--they're too stupid.

JOB ARTHUR. They've never had a try yet.

GERALD. They're trying every day. They just simply couldn't control
modern industry--they haven't the intelligence. They've no LIFE
intelligence. The owners may have little enough, but Labour has none.
They're just mechanical little things that can make one or two motions,
and they're done. They've no more idea of life than a lawn-mower has.

JOB ARTHUR. It remains to be seen.

GERALD. No, it doesn't. It's perfectly obvious--there's nothing remains
to be seen. All that Labour is capable of, is smashing things up. And
even for that I don't believe it has either the energy or the courage or
the bit of necessary passion, or slap-dash--call it whatever you will.
However, we'll see.

JOB ARTHUR. Yes, sir. Perhaps you see now why you're not so very
popular, Mr. Gerald.

GERALD. We can't all be popular, Job Arthur. You're very high up in
popularity, I believe.

JOB ARTHUR. Not so very. They listen to me a bit. But you never know
when they'll let you down. I know they'll let me down one day--so it
won't be a surprise.

GERALD. I should think not.

JOB ARTHUR. But about the office men, Mr. Gerald. You think it'll be all
right?

GERALD. Oh, yes, that'll be all right.

JOB ARTHUR. Easiest for this time, anyhow, sir. We don't want bloodshed,
do we?

GERALD. I shouldn't mind at all. It might clear the way to something.
But I have absolutely no belief in the power of Labour even to bring
about anything so positive as bloodshed.

JOB ARTHUR. I don't know about that--I don't know. Well.

GERALD. Have another drink before you go.--Yes, do. Help yourself.

JOB ARTHUR. Well--if you're so pressing. (Helps himself.) Here's luck,
all!

ALL. Thanks.

GERALD. Take a cigar--there's the box. Go on--take a handful--fill your
case.

JOB ARTHUR. They're a great luxury nowadays, aren't they? Almost beyond
a man like me.

GERALD. Yes, that's the worst of not being a bloated capitalist. Never
mind, you'll be a Cabinet Minister some day.--Oh, all right--I'll open
the door for you.

JOB ARTHUR. Oh, don't trouble. Good night--good night. (Exeunt.)

OLIVER. Oh, God, what a world to live in!

ANABEL. I rather liked him. What is he?

OLIVER. Checkweighman--local secretary for the Miner's Federation--plays
the violin well, although he was a collier, and it spoilt his hands.
They're a musical family.

ANABEL. But isn't he rather nice?

OLIVER. I don't like him. But I confess he's a study. He's the modern
Judas.

ANABEL. Don't you think he likes Gerald?

OLIVER. I'm sure he does. The way he suns himself here--like a cat
purring in his luxuriation.

ANABEL. Yes--I don't mind it. It shows a certain sensitiveness and a
certain taste.

OLIVER. Yes, he has both--touch of the artist, as Mrs. Barlow says. He
loves refinement, culture, breeding, all those things--loves them--and a
presence, a fine free manner.

ANABEL. But that is nice in him.

OLIVER. Quite. But what he loves, and what he admires, and what he
aspires to, he MUST betray. It's his fatality. He lives for the moment
when he can kiss Gerald in the Garden of Olives, or wherever it was.

ANABEL. But Gerald shouldn't be kissed.

OLIVER. That's what I say.

ANABEL. And that's what his mother means as well, I suppose.


(Enter GERALD.)


GERALD. Well--you've heard the voice of the people.

ANABEL. He isn't the people.

GERALD. I think he is, myself--the epitome.

OLIVER. No, he's a special type.

GERALD. Ineffectual, don't you think?

ANABEL. How pleased you are, Gerald! How pleased you are with yourself!
You love the turn with him.

GERALD. It's rather stimulating, you know.

ANABEL. It oughtn't to be, then.

OLIVER. He's you Judas, and you love him.

GERALD. Nothing so deep. He's just a sort of AEolian harp that sings to
the temper of the wind. I find him amusing.

ANABEL. I think it's boring.

OLIVER. And I think it's nasty.

GERALD. I believe you're both jealous of him. What do you think of the
working man, Oliver?

OLIVER. It seems to me he's in nearly as bad a way as the British
employer: he's nearly as much beside the point.

GERALD. What point?

OLIVER. Oh, just life.

GERALD. That's too vague, my boy. Do you think they'll ever make a
bust-up?

OLIVER. I can't tell. I don't see any good in it, if they do.

GERALD. It might clear the way--and it might block the way for ever:
depends what comes through. But, sincerely, I don't think they've got it
in them.

ANABEL. They may have something better.

GERALD. That suggestion doesn't interest me, Anabel. Ah, well, we shall
see what we shall see. Have a whisky and soda with me, Oliver, and let
the troubled course of this evening run to a smooth close. It's quite
like old times. Aren't you smoking, Anabel?

ANABEL. No, thanks.

GERALD. I believe you're a reformed character. So it won't be like old
times, after all.

ANABEL. I don't want old times. I want new ones.

GERALD. Wait till Job Arthur has risen like Anti-christ, and proclaimed
the resurrection of the gods.--Do you see Job Arthur proclaiming
Dionysos and Aphrodite?

ANABEL. It bores me. I don't like your mood. Good night.

GERALD. Oh, don't go.

ANABEL. Yes, good night. (Exit.)

OLIVER. She's NOT reformed, Gerald. She's the same old moral
character--moral to the last bit of her, really--as she always was.

GERALD. Is that what it is?--But one must be moral.

OLIVER. Oh, yes. Oliver Cromwell wasn't as moral as Anabel is--nor such
an iconoclast.

GERALD. Poor old Anabel!

OLIVER. How she hates the dark gods!

GERALD. And yet they cast a spell over her. Poor old Anabel! Well,
Oliver, is Bacchus the father of whisky?

OLIVER. I don't know.--I don't like you either. You seem to smile all
over yourself. It's objectionable. Good night.

GERALD. Oh, look here, this is censorious.

OLIVER. You smile to yourself. (Exit.)


(Curtain.)




ACT III


SCENE I

  An old park.  Early evening.  In the background a low Georgian
  hall, which has been turned into offices for the Company, shows
  windows already lighted.  GERALD and ANABEL walk along the path.


ANABEL. How beautiful this old park is!

GERALD. Yes, it is beautiful--seems so far away from everywhere, if one
doesn't remember that the hall is turned into offices.--No one has lived
here since I was a little boy. I remember going to a Christmas party at
the Walsalls'.

ANABEL. Has it been shut up so long?

GERALD. The Walsalls didn't like it--too near the ugliness. They were
county, you know--we never were: father never gave mother a chance,
there. And besides, the place is damp, cellars full of water.

ANABEL. Even now?

GERALD. No, not now--they've been drained. But the place would be too
damp for a dwelling-house. It's all right as offices. They burn enormous
fires. The rooms are quite charming. This is what happens to the stately
homes of England--they buzz with inky clerks, or their equivalent.
Stateliness is on its last legs.

ANABEL. Yes, it grieves me--though I should be bored if I had to
be stately, I think.--Isn't it beautiful in this light, like an
eighteenth-century aquatint? I'm sure no age was as ugly as this, since
the world began.

GERALD. For pure ugliness, certainly not. And I believe none has been
so filthy to live in.--Let us sit down a minute, shall we? and watch the
rooks fly home. It always stirs sad, sentimental feelings in me.

ANABEL. So it does in me.--Listen! one can hear the coal-carts on the
road--and the brook--and the dull noise of the town--and the beating of
New London pit--and voices--and the rooks--and yet it is so still. We
seem so still here, don't we?

GERALD. Yes.

ANABEL. Don't you think we've been wrong?

GERALD. How?

ANABEL. In the way we've lived--and the way we've loved.

GERALD. It hasn't been heaven, has it? Yet I don't know that we've been
wrong, Anabel. We had it to go through.

ANABEL. Perhaps.--And, yes, we've been wrong, too.

GERALD. Probably. Only, I don't feel it like that.

ANABEL. Then I think you ought. You ought to feel you've been wrong.

GERALD. Yes, probably. Only, I don't. I can't help it. I think we've
gone the way we had to go, following our own natures.

ANABEL. And where has it landed us?

GERALD. Here.

ANABEL. And where is that?

GERALD. Just on this bench in the park, looking at the evening.

ANABEL. But what next?

GERALD. God knows! Why trouble?

ANABEL. One must trouble. I want to feel sure.

GERALD. What of?

ANABEL. Of you--and of myself.

GERALD. Then BE sure.

ANABEL. But I can't. Think of the past--what it's been.

GERALD. This isn't the past.

ANABEL. But what is it? Is there anything sure in it? Is there any real
happiness?

GERALD. Why not?

ANABEL. But how can you ask? Think of what our life has been.

GERALD. I don't want to.

ANABEL. No, you don't. But what DO you want?

GERALD. I'm all right, you know, sitting here like this.

ANABEL. But one can't sit here forever, can one?

GERALD. I don't want to.

ANABEL. And what will you do when we leave here?

GERALD. God knows! Don't worry me. Be still a bit.

ANABEL. But I'M worried. You don't love me.

GERALD. I won't argue it.

ANABEL. And I'm not happy.

GERALD. Why not, Anabel?

ANABEL. Because you don't love me--and I can't forget.

GERALD. I do love you--and to-night I've forgotten.

ANABEL. Then make me forget, too. Make me happy.

GERALD. I CAN'T make you--and you know it.

ANABEL. Yes, you can. It's your business to make me happy. I've made you
happy.

GERALD. You want to make me unhappy.

ANABEL. I DO think you're the last word in selfishness. If I say I can't
forget, you merely say, "I'VE forgotten"; and if I say I'm unhappy, all
YOU can answer is that I want to make YOU unhappy. I don't in the least.
I want to be happy myself. But you don't help me.

GERALD. There is no help for it, you see. If you WERE happy with me here
you'd be happy. As you aren't, nothing will make you--not genuinely.

ANABEL. And that's all you care.

GERALD. No--I wish we could both be happy at the same moment. But
apparently we can't.

ANABEL. And why not?--Because you're selfish, and think of nothing but
yourself and your own feelings.

GERALD. If it is so, it is so.

ANABEL. Then we shall never be happy.

GERALD. Then we sha'n't. (A pause.)

ANABEL. Then what are we going to do?

GERALD. Do?

ANABEL. Do you want me to be with you?

GERALD. Yes.

ANABEL. Are you sure?

GERALD. Yes.

ANABEL. Then why don't you want me to be happy?

GERALD. If you'd only BE happy, here and now---

ANABEL. How can I?

GERALD. How can't you?--You've got a devil inside you.

ANABEL. Then make me not have a devil.

GERALD. I've know you long enough--and known myself long enough--to know
I can make you nothing at all, Anabel: neither can you make me. If
the happiness isn't there--well, we shall have to wait for it, like
a dispensation. It probably means we shall have to hate each other a
little more.--I suppose hate is a real process.

ANABEL. Yes, I know you believe more in hate than in love.

GERALD. Nobody is more weary of hate than I am--and yet we can't fix our
own hour, when we shall leave off hating and fighting. It has to work
itself out in us.

ANABEL. But I don't WANT to hate and fight with you any more. I don't
BELIEVE in it--not any more.

GERALD. It's a cleansing process--like Aristotle's Katharsis. We shall
hate ourselves clean at last, I suppose.

ANABEL. Why aren't you clean now? Why can't you love? (He laughs.) DO
you love me?

GERALD. Yes.

ANABEL. Do you want to be with me for ever?

GERALD. Yes.

ANABEL. Sure?

GERALD. Quite sure.

ANABEL. Why are you so cool about it?

GERALD. I'm not. I'm only sure--which you are not.

ANABEL. Yes, I am--I WANT to be married to you.

GERALD. I know you want me to want you to be married to me. But whether
off your own bat you have a positive desire that way, I'm not sure. You
keep something back--some sort of female reservation--like a dagger up
your sleeve. You want to see me in transports of love for you.

ANABEL. How can you say so? There--you see--there--this is the man that
pretends to love me, and then says I keep a dagger up my sleeve. You
liar!

GERALD. I do love you--and you do keep a dagger up your sleeve--some
devilish little female reservation which spies at me from a distance, in
your soul, all the time, as if I were an enemy.

ANABEL. How CAN you say so?--Doesn't it show what you must be yourself?
Doesn't it show?--What is there in your soul?

GERALD. I don't know.

ANABEL. Love, pure love?--Do you pretend it's love?

GERALD. I'm so tired of this.

ANABEL. So am I, dead tired: you self-deceiving, self complacent thing.
Ha!--aren't you just the same? You haven't altered one scrap not a
scrap.

GERALD. All right--you are always free to change yourself.

ANABEL. I HAVE changed I AM better, I DO love you--I love you wholly and
unselfishly--I do--and I want a good new life with you.

GERALD. You're terribly wrapped up in your new goodness. I wish you'd
make up your mind to be downright bad.

ANABEL. Ha!--Do you?--You'd soon see. You'd soon see where you'd be
if---- There's somebody coming. (Rises.)

GERALD. Never mind; it's the clerks leaving work, I suppose. Sit still.

ANABEL. Won't you go?

GERALD. No. (A man draws near, followed by another.)

CLERK. Good evening, sir. (Passes on.) Good evening, Mr. Barlow.

ANABEL. They are afraid.

GERALD. I suppose their consciences are uneasy about this strike.

ANABEL. Did you come to sit here just to catch them, like a spider
waiting for them?

GERALD. No. I wanted to speak to Breffitt.

ANABEL. I believe you're capable of any horridness.

GERALD. All right, you believe it. (Two more figures approach.) Good
evening.

CLERKS. Good night, sir. (One passes, one stops.) Good evening, Mr.
Barlow. Er--did you want to see Mr. Breffitt, sir?

GERALD. Not particularly.

CLERK. Oh! He'll be out directly, sir--if you'd like me to go back and
tell him you wanted him?

GERALD. No, thank you.

CLERK. Good night, sir. Excuse me asking.

GERALD. Good night.

ANABEL. Who is Mr. Breffitt?

GERALD. He is the chief clerk--and cashier--one of father's old pillars
of society.

ANABEL. Don't you like him?

GERALD. Not much.

ANABEL. Why?--You seem to dislike very easily.

GERALD. Oh, they all used to try to snub me, these old buffers. They
detest me like poison, because I am different from father.

ANABEL. I believe you enjoy being detested.

GERALD. I do. (Another clerk approaches--hesitates--stops.)

CLERK. Good evening, sir. Good evening, Mr. Barlow. Er--did you want
anybody at the office, sir? We're just closing.

GERALD. No, I didn't want anybody.

CLERK. Oh, no, sir. I see. Er--by the way, sir--er--I hope you don't
think this--er--bother about an increase--this strike threat--started in
the office?

GERALD. Where did it start?

CLERK. I should think it started--where it usually starts, Mr.
Barlow--among a few loud-mouthed people who think they can do as they
like with the men. They're only using the office men as a cry--They've
no interest in us. They want to show their power.--That's how it is,
sir.

GERALD. Oh, yes.

CLERK. We're powerless, if they like to make a cry out of us.

GERALD. Quite.

CLERK. We're as much put out about it as anybody.

GERALD. Of course.

CLERK. Yes--well--good night, sir. (Clerks draw near--there is a sound
of loud young voices and bicycle bells. Bicycles sweep past.)

CLERKS. Good night, sir.--Good night, sir.

GERALD. Good night.--They're very bucked to see me sitting here with
a woman--a young lady as they'll say. I guess your name will be flying
round to-morrow. They stop partly to have a good look at you. Do they
know you, do you think?

ANABEL. Sure.

CLERKS. Mr. Breffitt's just coming, sir.--Good night, sir.--Good night,
sir. (Another bicycle passes.)

ANABEL. The bicycles don't see us.--Isn't it rather hateful to be a
master? The attitude of them all is so ugly. I can quite see that it
makes you rather a bully.

GERALD. I suppose it does. (Figure of a large man approaches.)

BREFFITT. Oh--ah--it's Mr. Gerald!--I couldn't make out who it
was.--Were you coming up to the office, sir? Do you want me to go back
with you?

GERALD. No, thank you--I just wanted a word with you about this
agitation. It'll do just as well here. It's a pity it started--that the
office should have set it going, Breffitt.

BREFFITT. It's none of the office's doing, I think you'll find, Mr.
Gerald. The office men did nothing but ask for a just advance--at any
rate, time and prices being what they are, I consider it a fair advance.
If the men took it up, it's because they've got a set of loud-mouthed
blatherers and agitators among them like Job Arthur Freer, who deserve
to be hung--and hanging they'd get, if I could have the judging of them.

GERALD. Well--it's very unfortunate--because we can't give the clerks
their increase now, you know.

BREFFITT. Can't you?--can't you? I can't see that it would be anything
out of the way, if I say what I think.

GERALD. No. They won't get any increase now. It shouldn't have been
allowed to become a public cry with the colliers. We can't give in now.

BREFFITT. Have the Board decided that?

GERALD. They have--on my advice.

BREFFITT. Hm!--then the men will come out.

GERALD. We will see.

BREFFITT. It's trouble for nothing--it's trouble that could be avoided.
The clerks could have their advance, and it would hurt nobody.

GERALD. Too late now.--I suppose if the men come out, the clerks will
come out with them?

BREFFITT. They'll have to--they'll have to.

GERALD. If they do, we may then make certain alterations in the office
staff which have needed making for some time.

BREFFITT. Very good--very good. I know what you mean.--I don't know how
your father bears all this, Mr. Gerald.

GERALD. We keep it from him as much as possible.--You'll let the clerks
know the decision. And if they stay out with the men, I'll go over the
list of the staff with you. It has needed revising for a long time.

BREFFITT. I know what you mean--I know what you mean--I believe I
understand the firm's interest in my department. I ought, after forty
years studying it. I've studied the firm's interest for forty years, Mr.
Gerald. I'm not likely to forget them now.

GERALD. Of course.

BREFFITT. But I think it's a mistake--I think it's a mistake, and I'm
bound to say it, to let a great deal of trouble rise for a very small
cause. The clerks might have had what they reasonably asked her.

GERALD. Well, it's too late now.

BREFFITT. I suppose it is--I suppose it is. I hope you'll remember, sir,
that I've put the interest of the firm before everything--before every
consideration.

GERALD. Of course, Breffitt.

BREFFITT. But you've not had any liking for the office staff, I'm
afraid, sir--not since your father put you amongst us for a few
months.--Well, sir, we shall weather this gale, I hope, as we've
weathered those in the past. Times don't become better, do they? Men are
an ungrateful lot, and these agitators should be lynched. They would, if
I had my way.

GERALD. Yes, of course. Don't wait.

BREFFITT. Good night to you. (Exit.)

GERALD. Good night.

ANABEL. He's the last, apparently.

GERALD. We'll hope so.

ANABEL. He puts you in a fury.

GERALD. It's his manner. My father spoilt them--abominable old limpets.
And they're so self-righteous. They think I'm a sort of criminal who has
instigated this new devilish system which runs everything so close
and cuts it so fine--as if they hadn't made this inevitable by their
shameless carelessness and wastefulness in the past. He may well boast
of his forty years--forty years' crass, stupid wastefulness.


     (Two or three more clerks pass, talking till they approach the seat,
     then becoming silent after bidding good night.)


ANABEL. But aren't you a bit sorry for them?

GERALD. Why? If they're poor, what does it matter in a world of chaos?

ANABEL. And aren't you an obstinate ass not to give them the bit they
want. It's mere stupid obstinacy.

GERALD. It may be. I call it policy.

ANABEL. Men always do call their obstinacy policy.

GERALD. Well, I don't care what happens. I wish things would come to a
head. I only fear they won't.

ANABEL. Aren't you rather wicked?--ASKING for strife?

GERALD. I hope I am. It's quite a relief to me to feel that I may be
wicked. I fear I'm not. I can see them all anticipating victory, in
their low-down fashion wanting to crow their low-down crowings. I'm
afraid I feel it's a righteous cause, to cut a lot of little combs
before I die.

ANABEL. But if they're right in what they want?

GERALD. In the right--in the right!--They're just greedy, incompetent,
stupid, gloating in a sense of the worst sort of power. They're like
vicious children, who would like to kill their parents so that they
could have the run of the larder. The rest is just cant.

ANABEL. If you're the parent in the case, I must say you flow over with
loving-kindness for them.

GERALD. I don't--I detest them. I only hope they will fight. If they
would, I'd have some respect for them. But you'll see what it will be.

ANABEL. I wish I needn't, for it's very sickening.

GERALD. Sickening beyond expression.

ANABEL. I wish we could go right away.

GERALD. So do I--If one could get oneself out of this. But one
can't. It's the same wherever you have industrialism--and you have
industrialism everywhere, whether it's in Timbuctoo or Paraguay or
Antananarivo.

ANABEL. No, it isn't: you exaggerate.

JOB ARTHUR (suddenly approaching from the other side). Good evening, Mr.
Barlow. I heard you were in here. Could I have a word with you?

GERALD. Get on with it, then.

JOB ARTHUR. Is it right that you won't meet the clerks?

GERALD. Yes.

JOB ARTHUR. Not in any way?

GERALD. Not in any way whatsoever.

JOB ARTHUR. But--I thought I understood from you the other night---

GERALD. It's all the same what you understood.

JOB ARTHUR. Then you take it back, sir?

GERALD. I take nothing back, because I gave nothing.

JOB ARTHUR. Oh, excuse me, excuse me, sir. You said it would be all
right about the clerks. This lady heard you say it.

GERALD. Don't you call witnesses against me.--Besides, what does it
matter to you? What in the name of---

JOB ARTHUR. Well, sir, you said it would be all right, and I went on
that---

GERALD. You went on that! Where did you go to?

JOB ARTHUR. The men'll be out on Monday.

GERALD. So shall I.

JOB ARTHUR. Oh, yes, but--where's it going to end?

GERALD. Do you want me to prophesy? When did I set up for a public
prophet?

JOB ARTHUR. I don't know, sir. But perhaps you're doing more than you
know. There's a funny feeling just now among the men.

GERALD. So I've heard before. Why should I concern myself with their
feelings? Am I to cry when every collier bumps his funny-bone--or to
laugh?

JOB ARTHUR. It's no laughing matter, you see.

GERALD. An I'm sure it's no crying matter--unless you want to cry, do
you see?

JOB ARTHUR. Ah, but, very likely, it wouldn't be me would cry.--You
don't know what might happen, now.

GERALD. I'm waiting for something to happen. I should like something to
happen--very much--very much indeed.

JOB ARTHUR. Yes, but perhaps you'd be sorry if it did happen.

GERALD. Is that warning or a threat?

JOB ARTHUR. I don't know--it might be a bit of both. What I mean to
say---

GERALD (suddenly seizing him by the scruff of the neck and shaking him).
What do you mean to say?--I mean you to say less, do you see?--a great
deal less--do you see? You've run on with your saying long enough: that
clock had better run down. So stop your sayings--stop your sayings,
I tell you--or you'll have them shaken out of you--shaken out of
you--shaken out of you, do you see? (Suddenly flings him aside.)


(JOB ARTHUR, staggering, falls.)


ANABEL. Oh, no!--oh, no!

GERALD. Now get up, Job Arthur; and get up wiser than you went down.
You've played your little game and your little tricks and made your
little sayings long enough. You're going to stop now. We've had quite
enough of strong men of your stamp, Job Arthur--quite enough--such
labour leaders as you.

JOB ARTHUR. You'll be sorry, Mr. Barlow--you'll be sorry. You'll wish
you'd not attacked me.

GERALD. Don't you trouble about me and my sorrow. Mind your own.

JOB ARTHUR. You will--you'll be sorry. You'll be sorry for what you've
done. You'll wish you'd never begun this.

GERALD. Begun--begun?--I'd like to finish, too, that I would. I'd like
to finish with you, too--I warn YOU.

JOB ARTHUR. I warn you--I warn you. You won't go on much longer. Every
parish has its own vermin.

GERALD. Vermin?

JOB ARTHUR. Every parish has its own vermin; it lies with every parish
to destroy its own. We sha'n't have a clean parish till we've destroyed
the vermin we've got.

GERALD. Vermin? The fool's raving. Vermin!--Another phrase-maker, by
God! Another phrase-maker to lead the people.--Vermin? What vermin? I
know quite well what _I_ mean by vermin, Job Arthur. But what do you
mean? Vermin? Explain yourself.

JOB ARTHUR. Yes, vermin. Vermin is what lives on other people's lives,
living on their lives and profiting by it. We've got 'em in every
parish--vermin, I say--that live on the sweat and blood of the
people--live on it, and get rich on it--get rich through living on other
people's lives, the lives of the working men--living on the bodies
of the working men--that's vermin--if it isn't, what is it? And every
parish must destroy its own--every parish must destroy its own vermin.

GERALD. The phrase, my God! the phrase.

JOB ARTHUR. Phrase or not phrase, there it is, and face it out if you
can. There it is--there's not one in every parish--there's more than
one--there's a number---

GERALD (suddenly kicking him). Go! (Kicks him.) Go! (Kicks him.) go!
(JOB ARTHUR falls.) Get out! (Kicks him.) Get out, I say! Get out, I
tell you! Get out! Get out!--Vermin!--Vermin!--I'll vermin you! I'll put
my foot through your phrases. Get up, I say, get up and go--GO!

JOB ARTHUR. It'll be you as'll go, this time.

GERALD. What? What?--By God! I'll kick you out of this park like a
rotten bundle if you don't get up and go.

ANABEL. No, Gerald, no. Don't forget yourself. It's enough now. It's
enough now.--Come away. Do come away. Come away--leave him---

JOB ARTHUR (still on the ground). It's your turn to go. It's you as'll
go, this time.

GERALD (looking at him). One can't even tread on you.

ANABEL. Don't, Gerald, don't--don't look at him.--Don't say any more,
you, Job Arthur.--Come away, Gerald. Come away--come--do come.

GERALD (turning). THAT a human being! My God!--But he's right--it's
I who go. It's we who go, Anabel. He's still there.--My God! a human
being!


(Curtain.)



SCENE II

  Market-place as in Act I.  WILLIE HOUGHTON, addressing a large
  crowd of men from the foot of the obelisk.


WILLIE. And now you're out on strike--now you've been out for a week
pretty nearly, what further are you? I heard a great deal of talk about
what you were going to do. Well, what ARE you going to do? You don't
know. You've not the smallest idea. You haven't any idea whatsoever.
You've got your leaders. Now then, Job Arthur, throw a little light
on the way in front, will you: for it seems to me we're lost in a bog.
Which way are we to steer? Come--give the word, and let's gee-up.

JOB ARTHUR. You ask me which way we are to go. I say we can't go our own
way, because of the obstacles that lie in front. You've got to remove
the obstacles from the way.

WILLIE. So said Balaam's ass. But you're not an ass--beg pardon; and
you're not Balaam--you're Job. And we've all got to be little Jobs,
learning how to spell patience backwards. We've lost our jobs and we've
found a Job. It's picking up a scorpion when you're looking for an
egg.--Tell us what you propose doing.... Remove an obstacle from the
way! What obstacle? And whose way?

JOB ARTHUR. I think it's pretty plain what the obstacle is.

WILLIE. Oh, ay. Tell us then.

JOB ARTHUR. The obstacle to Labour is Capital.

WILLIE. And how are we going to put salt on Capital's tail?

JOB ARTHUR. By Labour we mean us working men; and by Capital we mean
those that derive benefit from us, take the cream off us and leave us
the skim.

WILLIE. Oh, yes.

JOB ARTHUR. So that, if you're going to remove the obstacle, you've
got to remove the masters, and all that belongs to them. Does everybody
agree with me?

VOICES (loud). Ah, we do--yes--we do that--we do an' a'--yi--yi--that's
it!

WILLIE. Agreed unanimously. But how are we going to do it? Do you
propose to send for Williamson's furniture van, to pack them in? I
should think one pantechnicon would do, just for this parish. I'll
drive. Who'll be the vanmen to list and carry?

JOB ARTHUR. It's no use fooling. You've fooled for thirty years, and
we're no further. What's got to be done will have to be begun. It's for
every man to sweep in front of his own doorstep. You can't call your
neighbours dirty till you've washed your own face. Every parish has got
its own vermin, and it's the business of every parish to get rid of its
own.

VOICES. That's it--that's it--that's the ticket--that's the style!

WILLIE. And are you going to comb 'em out, or do you propose to use
Keating's?

VOICES. Shut it! Shut it up! Stop thy face! Hold thy gab!--Go on, Job
Arthur.

JOB ARTHUR. How it's got to be done is for us all to decide. I'm not one
for violence, except it's a force-put. But it's like this. We've been
travelling for years to where we stand now--and here the road stops.
There's a precipice below and a rock-face above. And in front of us
stand the masters. Now there's three things we can do. We can either
throw ourselves over the precipice; or we can lie down and let the
masters walk over us; or we can GET ON.

WILLIE. Yes. That's all right. But how are you going to get on?

JOB ARTHUR. Well--we've either got to throw the obstacle down the
cliff--or walk over it.

VOICES. Ay--ay--ay--yes--that's a fact.

WILLIE. I quite follow you, Job Arthur. You've either got to do for the
masters--or else just remove them, and put them somewhere else.

VOICES. Get rid on 'em--drop 'em down the shaft--sink 'em--ha' done
wi' 'em--drop 'em down the shaft--bust the beggars--what do you do wi'
vermin?

WILLIE. Supposing you begin. Supposing you take Gerald Barlow, and
hang him up from his lamp-post, with a piece of coal in his mouth for a
sacrament---

VOICES. Ay--serve him right--serve the beggar right! Shove it down's
throttle--ay!

WILLIE. Supposing you do it--supposing you've done it--and supposing you
aren't caught and punished--even supposing that--what are you going to
do next?--THAT'S the point.

JOB ARTHUR. We know what we're going to do. Once we can get our hands
free, we know what we're going to do.

WILLIE. Yes, so do I. You're either going to make SUCH a mess that we
shall never get out of it--which I don't think you will do, for the
English working man is the soul of obedience and order, and he'd behave
himself to-morrow as if he was at Sunday school, no matter what he does
to-day.--No, what you'll do, Job Arthur, you'll set up another lot of
masters, such a jolly sight worse than what we've got now. I'd rather be
mastered by Gerald Barlow, if it comes to mastering, than by Job Arthur
Freer--oh, SUCH a lot! You'll be far less free with Job Arthur for
your boss than ever you were with Gerald Barlow. You'll be far more
degraded.--In fact, though I've preached socialism in the market-place
for thirty years--if you're going to start killing the masters to set
yourselves up as bosses--why, kill me along with the masters. For
I'd rather die with somebody who has one tiny little spark of decency
left--though it IS a little tiny spark--than live to triumph with those
that have none.

VOICES. Shut thy face, Houghton--shut it up--shut him up--hustle
the beggar! Hoi!--hoi-ee!--whoo!--whoam-it, whoam-it!--whoo!--
bow-wow!--wet-whiskers!----

WILLIE. And it's no use you making fool of yourselves---- (His words are
heard through an ugly, jeering, cold commotion.)

VOICE (loudly). He's comin'.

VOICES. Who?

VOICE. Barlow.--See 's motor?--comin' up--sithee?

WILLIE. If you've any sense left---- (Suddenly and violently
disappears.)

VOICES. Sorry!--he's comin'--'s comin'--sorry, ah! Who's in?--That's
Turton drivin'--yi, he's behind wi' a woman--ah, he's comin'--he'll none
go back--hold on. Sorry!--wheer's 'e comin'?--up from Loddo--ay---- (The
cries die down--the motor car slowly comes into sight, OLIVER driving,
GERALD and ANABEL behind. The men stand in a mass in the way.)

OLIVER. Mind yourself, there. (Laughter.)

GERALD. Go ahead, Oliver.

VOICE. What's yer 'urry?


    (Crowd sways and surges on the car. OLIVER is suddenly dragged out.
     GERALD stands up--he, too, is seized from behind--he wrestles--is
     torn out of his greatcoat--then falls--disappears.  Loud cries--
     "Hi!--hoi!--hoiee!"--all the while.  The car shakes and presses
     uneasily.)


VOICE. Stop the blazin' motor, somebody.

VOICE. Here y' are!--hold a minute. (A man jumps in and stops the
engine--he drops in the driver's seat.)

COLLIER (outside the car). Step down, miss.

ANABEL. I am Mrs. Barlow.

COLLIER. Missis, then. (Laugh.) Step done--lead 'er forrard. Take 'em
forrard.

JOB ARTHUR. Ay, make a road.

GERALD. You're makin' a proper fool of yourself now, Freer.

JOB ARTHUR. You've brought it on yourself. YOU'VE made fools of plenty
of men.

COLLIERS. Come on, now--come on! Whoa!--whoa!--he's a jibber--go pretty
now, go pretty!

VOICES (suddenly). Lay hold o' Houghton--nab 'im--seize
'im--rats!--rats!--bring 'im forrard!

ANABEL (in a loud, clear voice). I never knew anything so RIDICULOUS.

VOICES (falsetto). Ridiculous! Oh, ridiculous! Mind the step, dear!--I'm
Mrs. Barlow!--Oh, are you?--Tweet--tweet!

JOB ARTHUR. Make a space, boys, make a space, boys, make a space.
(He stands with prisoners in a cleared space before the obelisk.)
Now--now--quiet a minute--we want to ask a few questions of these
gentlemen.

VOICES. Quiet!--quiet!--Sh-h-h! Sh-h-h!--Answer pretty--answer pretty
now!--Quiet!--Shh-h-h!

JOB ARTHUR. We want to ask you, Mr. Gerald Barlow, why you have given
occasion for this present trouble.

GERALD. You are a fool.

VOICES. Oh!--oh!--naughty Barlow!--naughty baa-lamb--answer pretty--be
good baa-lamb--baa--baa!--answer pretty when gentleman asks you.

JOB ARTHUR. Quiet a bit Sh-h-h!--We put this plain question to you,
Mr. Barlow. Why did you refuse to give the clerks this just and fair
advance, when you knew that by refusing you would throw three thousand
men out of employment?

GERALD. You are a fool, I say.

VOICES. Oh!--oh!--won't do--won't do, Barlow--wrong answer--wrong
answer--be good baa-lamb--naughty boy--naughty boy!

JOB ARTHUR. Quiet a bit now!--If three thousand men ask you a just,
straightforward question, do you consider they've no right to an answer?

GERALD. I would answer you with my foot.

VOICES (amid a threatening scuffle). Da-di-da! Hark ye--hark ye!
Oh--whoa--whoa a bit!--won't do!--won't do!--naughty--naughty--say
you're sorry--say you're sorry--kneel and say you're sorry--kneel and
beg pardon!

JOB ARTHUR. Hold on a bit--keep clear!

VOICES. Make him kneel--make him kneel--on his knees with him!

JOB ARTHUR. I think you'd better kneel down.


    (The crowd press on GERALD--he struggles--they hit him behind the
     knees, force him down.)


OLIVER. This is shameful and unnecessary.

VOICES. All of 'em--on your knees--all of' em--on their knees!


    (The seize OLIVER and WILLIE and ANABEL, hustling. ANABEL kneels
     quietly--the others struggle.)


WILLIE. Well, of all the damned, dirty, cowardly---

VOICES. Shut up, Houghton--shut him up--squeeze him!

OLIVER. Get off me--let me alone--I'll kneel.

VOICES. Good little doggies--nice doggies--kneel and beg
pardon--yap-yap--answer--make him answer!

JOB ARTHUR (holding up his hand for silence). It would be better if you
answered straight off, Barlow. We want to know why you prevented that
advance.

VOICES (after a pause). Nip his neck! Make him yelp!

OLIVER. Let me answer, then.--Because it's worse, perhaps, to be bullied
by three thousand men than by one man.

VOICES. Oh!--oh!--dog keeps barking--stuff his mouth--stop him
up--here's a bit of paper--answer, Barlow--nip his neck--stuff his
mug--make him yelp--cork the bottle!


    (They press a lump of newspaper into OLIVER'S mouth, and bear down on
     GERALD.)


JOB ARTHUR. Quiet--quiet--quiet a minute, everybody. We give him a
minute--we give him a minute to answer.

VOICES. Give him a minute--a holy minute--say your prayers,
Barlow--you've got a minute--tick-tick, says the clock--time him!

JOB ARTHUR. Keep quiet.

WILLIE. Of all the damned, cowardly---

VOICES. Sh-h-h!--Squeeze him--throttle him! Silence is golden,
Houghton.--Close the shutters, Willie's dead.--Dry up, wet whiskers!

JOB ARTHUR. You've fifteen seconds.

VOICES. There's a long, long trail a-winding---

JOB ARTHUR. The minute's up.--We ask you again, Gerald Barlow, why you
refused a just and fair demand, when you know it was against the wishes
of three thousand men all as good as yourself.

VOICES. And a sight better--I don't think--we're not all vermin--we're
not all crawlers, living off the sweat of other folks--we're not all
parish vermin--parish vermin.

JOB ARTHUR. And on what grounds do you think you have no occasion to
answer the straightforward question we put you here?

ANABEL (after a pause). Answer them, Gerald. What's the use of
prolonging this?

GERALD. I've nothing to answer.

VOICES. Nothing to answer--Gerald, darling--Gerald, duckie--oh,
lovey-dovey--I've nothing to answer--no, by God--no, by God, he
hasna--nowt to answer--ma'e him find summat, then--answer for him--gi'e
him's answer--let him ha'e it--go on--mum--mum--lovey-dovey--rub his
nose in it--kiss the dirt, ducky--bend him down--rub his nose in--he's
saying something--oh, no, he isn't--sorry I spoke--bend him down!

JOB ARTHUR. Quiet a bit--quiet everybody--he's got to answer--keep
quiet.--Now---- (A silence.) Now then, Barlow, will you answer, or won't
you? (Silence.)

ANABEL. Answer them, Gerald--never mind.

VOICES. Sh-h-h! Sh-h-h! (Silence.)

JOB ARTHUR. You won't answer, Barlow?

VOICE. Down the beggar!

VOICES. Down him--put his nose down--flatten him!


    (The crowd surges and begins to howl--they sway dangerously--GERALD
     is spread-eagled on the floor, face down.)


JOB ARTHUR. Back--back--back a minute--back--back! (They recoil.)

WILLIE. I HOPE there's a God in heaven.

VOICES. Put him down--flatten him!


(WILLIE is flattened on the ground.)


JOB ARTHUR. Now, then--now then--if you won't answer, Barlow, I can't
stand here for you any more.--Take your feet off him, boys, and turn
him over--let us look at him. Let us see if he CAN speak. (They turn him
over, with another scuffle.) Now then, Barlow--you can see the sky above
you. Now do you think you're going to play with three thousand men,
with their lives and with their souls?--now do you think you're going to
answer them with your foot?--do you--do you?


    (The crowd has begun to sway and heave dangerously, with a low,
     muffled roar, above which is heard JOB ARTHUR'S voice.  As he
     ceases, the roar breaks into a yell--the crowd heaves.)


VOICES. Down him--crack the vermin--on top of him--put your foot on the
vermin!

ANABEL (with a loud, piercing cry, suddenly starting up). Ah, no! Ah,
no! Ah-h-h-h no-o-o-o! Ah-h-h-h no-o-o-o! Ah-h-h-h no-o-o-o! No-o-o-o!
No-o-o-o! No-o! No-o-o!--Ah-h-h-h!--it's enough, it's enough, it's
enough--he's a man as you are. He's a man as you are. He's a man as you
are. (Weeps--a breath of silence.)

OLIVER. Let us stop now--let us stop now. Let me stand up. (Silence.) I
want to stand up. (A muffled noise.)

VOICE. Let him get up. (OLIVER rises.)

OLIVER. Be quiet. Be quiet.--Now--choose! Choose! Choose! Choose what
you will do! Only choose! Choose!--it will be irrevocable. (A moment's
pause.) Thank God we haven't gone too far.--Gerald, get up. (Men still
hold him down.)

JOB ARTHUR. Isn't he to answer us? Isn't he going to answer us?

OLIVER. Yes, he shall answer you. He shall answer you. But let him stand
up. No more of this. Let him stand up. He must stand up. (Men still hold
GERALD down.) OLIVER takes hold of their hands and removes them.)
Let go--let go now. Yes, let go--yes--I ask you to let go. (Slowly,
sullenly, the men let go. GERALD is free, but he does not move.)
There--get up, Gerald! Get up! You aren't hurt, are you? You must get
up--it's no use. We're doing our best--you must do yours. When things
are like this, we have to put up with what we get. (GERALD rises slowly
and faces the mob. They roar dully.) You ask why the clerks didn't get
this increase? Wait! Wait! Do you still wish for any answer, Mr. Freer?

JOB ARTHUR. Yes, that's what we've been waiting for.

OLIVER. Then answer, Gerald.

GERALD. They've trodden on my face.

OLIVER. No matter. Job Arthur will easily answer that you've trodden
on their souls. Don't start an altercation. (The crowd is beginning to
roar.)

GERALD. You want to know why the clerks didn't get their rise?--Because
you interfered and attempted to bully about it, do you see. That's why.

VOICES. You want bullying.--You'll get bullying, you will.

OLIVER. Can't you see it's no good, either side? It's no mortal use.
We might as well all die to-morrow, or to-day, or this minute, as go on
bullying one another, one side bullying the other side, and the other
side bullying back. We'd BETTER all die.

WILLIE. And a great deal better. I'm damned if I'll take sides with
anybody against anything, after this. If I'm to die, I'll die by myself.
As for living, it seems impossible.

JOB ARTHUR. Have the men nothing to be said for their side?

OLIVER. They have a great deal--but not EVERYTHING, you see.

JOB ARTHUR. Haven't they been wronged? And AREN'T they wronged?

OLIVER. They have--and they are. But haven't they been wrong themselves,
too?--and aren't they wrong now?

JOB ARTHUR. How?

OLIVER. What about this affair? Do you call it right?

JOB ARTHUR. Haven't we been driven to it?

OLIVER. Partly. And haven't you driven the masters to it, as well?

JOB ARTHUR. I don't see that.

OLIVER. Can't you see that it takes two to make a quarrel? And as long
as each party hangs on to its own end of the stick and struggles to get
full hold of the stick, the quarrel will continue. It will continue till
you've killed one another. And even then, what better shall you be? What
better would you be, really, if you'd killed Gerald Barlow just now? You
wouldn't, you know. We're all human beings, after all. And why can't we
try really to leave off struggling against one another, and set up a new
state of things?

JOB ARTHUR. That's all very well, you see, while you've got the goods.

OLIVER. I've got very little, I assure you.

JOB ARTHUR. Well, if you haven't, those you mix with have. They've got
the money, and the power, and they intend to keep it.

OLIVER. As for power, somebody must have it, you know. It only rests
with you to put it into the hands of the best men, the men you REALLY
believe in.--And as for money, it's life, it's living that matters, not
simply having money.

JOB ARTHUR. You can't live without money.

OLIVER. I know that. And therefore why can't we have the decency to
agree simply about money--just agree to dispose of it so that all men
could live their own lives.

JOB ARTHUR. That's what we want to do. But the others, such as Gerald
Barlow, they keep the money--AND the power.

OLIVER. You see, if you wanted to arrange things so that money flowed
more naturally, so that it flowed naturally to every man, according to
his needs, I think we could all soon agree. But you don't. What you
want is to take it away from one set and give it to another--or keep it
yourselves.

JOB ARTHUR. We want every man to have his proper share.

OLIVER. I'm sure _I_ do. I want every man to be able to live and be
free. But we shall never manage it by fighting over the money. If you
want what is natural and good, I'm sure the owners would soon agree with
you.

JOB ARTHUR. What? Gerald Barlow agree with us?

OLIVER. Why not? I believe so.

JOB ARTHUR. You ask him.

OLIVER. Do you think, Gerald, that if the men really wanted a whole,
better way, you would agree with them?

GERALD. I want a better way myself--but not their way.

JOB ARTHUR. There, you see!

VOICES. Ah-h! look you!--That's him--that's him all over.

OLIVER. You want a better way,--but not his way: he wants a better
way--but not your way. Why can't you both drop your buts, and simply say
you want a better way, and believe yourselves and one another when you
say it? Why can't you?

GERALD. Look here! I'm quite as tired of my way of life as you are of
yours. If you make me believe you want something better, then I assure
you I do: I want what you want. But Job Arthur Freer's not the man
to lead you to anything better. You can tell what people want by the
leaders they choose, do you see? You choose leaders whom I respect, and
I'll respect you, do you see? As it is, I don't. And now I'm going.

VOICES. Who says?--Oh ay!--Who says goin'?

GERALD. Yes, I'm going. About this affair here we'll cry quits; no more
said about it. About a new way of life, a better way all round--I tell
you I want it and need it as much as ever you do. I don't care about
money really. But I'm never going to be bullied.

VOICE. Who doesn't care about money?

GERALD. I don't. I think we ought to be able to alter the whole
system--but not by bullying, not because one lot wants what the other
has got.

VOICE. No, because you've got everything.

GERALD. Where's my coat? Now then, step out of the way. (They move
towards the car.)


(Curtain.)
