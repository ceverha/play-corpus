THE COUNTESS CATHLEEN.




ACT I.


    _The cottage of SHEMUS REA. The door into the open air
    is at right side of room. There is a window at one
    side of the door, and a little shrine of the Virgin
    Mother at the other. At the back is a door opening into
    a bedroom, and at the left side of the room a pantry
    door. A wood of oak, beech, hazel, and quicken is seen
    through the window half hidden in vapour and twilight.
    MAIRE watches TEIG, who fills a pot with water. He
    stops as if to listen, and spills some of the water._

MAIRE.

    You are all thumbs.

TEIG.

                 Hear how the dog bays, mother,
    And how the gray hen flutters in the coop.
    Strange things are going up and down the land,
    These famine times: by Tubber-vanach crossroads
    A woman met a man with ears spread out,
    And they moved up and down like wings of bats.

MAIRE.

    Shemus stays late.

TEIG.

                     By Carrick-orus churchyard,
    A herdsman met a man who had no mouth,
    Nor ears, nor eyes: his face a wall of flesh;
    He saw him plainly by the moon.

MAIRE.

[_Going over to the little shrine._]

                                White Mary,
    Bring Shemus home out of the wicked woods;
    Save Shemus from the wolves; Shemus is daring;
    And save him from the demons of the woods,
    Who have crept out and wander on the roads,
    Deluding dim-eyed souls now newly dead,
    And those alive who have gone crazed with famine.
    Save him, White Mary Virgin.

TEIG.

                                  And but now
    I thought I heard far-off tympans and harps.

    [_Knocking at the door._

MAIRE.

    Shemus has come.

TEIG.

                    May he bring better food
    Than the lean crow he brought us yesterday.

    [_MAIRE opens the door, and SHEMUS comes in with a dead
    wolf on his shoulder._

MAIRE.

    Shemus, you are late home: you have been lounging
    And chattering with some one: you know well
    How the dreams trouble me, and how I pray,
    Yet you lie sweating on the hill from morn,
    Or linger at the crossways with all comers,
    Telling or gathering up calamity.

SHEMUS.

    You would rail my head off. Here is a good dinner.

    [_He throws the wolf on the table._

    A wolf is better than a carrion crow.
    I searched all day: the mice and rats and hedgehogs
    Seemed to be dead, and I could hardly hear
    A wing moving in all the famished woods,
    Though the dead leaves and clauber of four forests
    Cling to my footsole. I turned home but now,
    And saw, sniffing the floor in a bare cow-house,
    This young wolf here: the crossbow brought him down.

MAIRE.

    Praise be the saints!          [_After a pause._
                      Why did the house dog bay?

SHEMUS.

    He heard me coming and smelt food—what else?

TEIG.

    We will not starve awhile.

SHEMUS.

    What food is within?

TEIG.

    There is a bag half full of meal, a pan
    Half full of milk.

SHEMUS.

    And we have one old hen.

TEIG.

    The bogwood were less hard.

MAIRE.

                               Before you came
    She made a great noise in the hencoop, Shemus.
    What fluttered in the window?

TEIG.

                                Two horned owls
    Have blinked and fluttered on the window sill
    From when the dog began to bay.

SHEMUS.

    Hush, hush.

    [_He fits an arrow to the crossbow, and goes towards
    the door. A sudden burst of music without._

    They are off again: ladies or gentlemen
    Travel in the woods with tympan and with harp.
    Teig, put the wolf upon the biggest hook
    And shut the door.

    [_TEIG goes into the cupboard with the wolf: returns
    and fastens the door behind him._

                   Sit on the creepy stool
    And call up a whey face and a crying voice,
    And let your head be bowed upon your knees.

    [_He opens the door of the cabin._

    Come in, your honours: a full score of evenings
    This threshold worn away by many a foot
    Has been passed only by the snails and birds
    And by our own poor hunger-shaken feet.

    [_The COUNTESS CATHLEEN, ALEEL, who carries a small
    square harp, OONA, and a little group of fantastically
    dressed musicians come in._

CATHLEEN.

    Are you so hungry?

TEIG.

    [_From beside the fire._]

                       Lady, I fell but now,
    And lay upon the threshold like a log.
    I have not tasted a crust for these four days.

    [_The COUNTESS CATHLEEN empties her purse on to the
    table._

CATHLEEN.

    Had I more money I would give it you,
    But we have passed by many cabins to-day;
    And if you come to-morrow to my house
    You shall have twice the sum. I am the owner
    Of a long empty castle in these woods.

MAIRE.

    Then you are Countess Cathleen: you and yours
    Are ever welcome under my poor thatch.
    Will you sit down and warm you by the sods?

CATHLEEN.

    We must find out this castle in the wood
    Before the chill o’ the night.

    [_The musicians begin to tune their instruments._

                                 Do not blame me,
    Good woman, for the tympan and the harp:
    I was bid fly the terror of the times
    And wrap me round with music and sweet song
    Or else pine to my grave. I have lost my way;
    Aleel, the poet, who should know these woods,
    Because we met him on their border but now
    Wandering and singing like the foam of the sea,
    Is so wrapped up in dreams of terrors to come
    That he can give no help.

MAIRE.

    [_Going to the door with her._]

                             You’re almost there.
    There is a trodden way among the hazels
    That brings your servants to their marketing.

ALEEL.

    When we are gone draw to the door and the bolt,
    For, till we lost them half an hour ago,
    Two gray horned owls hooted above our heads
    Of terrors to come. Tympan and harp awake!
    For though the world drift from us like a sigh,
    Music is master of all under the moon;
    And play ‘The Wind that blows by Cummen Strand.’

    [_Music._

[_Sings._]

    _Impetuous heart, be still, be still:
    Your sorrowful love may never be told;
    Cover it up with a lonely tune.
    He who could bend all things to His will
    Has covered the door of the infinite fold
    With the pale stars and the wandering moon._

    [_While he is singing the COUNTESS CATHLEEN, OONA, and
    the musicians go out._

ALEEL.

    Shut to the door and shut the woods away,
    For, till they had vanished in the thick of the leaves,
    Two gray horned owls hooted above our heads.

    [_He goes out._

MAIRE.

[_Bolting the door._]

    When wealthy and wise folk wander from their peace
    And fear wood things, poor folk may draw the bolt
    And pray before the fire.

    [_SHEMUS counts out the money, and rings a piece upon
    the table._

SHEMUS.

                           The Mother of God,
    Hushed by the waving of the immortal wings,
    Has dropped in a doze and cannot hear the poor:
    I passed by Margaret Nolan’s; for nine days
    Her mouth was green with dock and dandelion;
    And now they wake her.

MAIRE.

                            I will go the next;
    Our parents’ cabins bordered the same field.

SHEMUS.

    God, and the Mother of God, have dropped asleep,
    For they are weary of the prayers and candles;
    But Satan pours the famine from his bag,
    And I am mindful to go pray to him
    To cover all this table with red gold.
    Teig, will you dare me to it?

TEIG.

    Not I, father.

MAIRE.

    O Shemus, hush, maybe your mind might pray
    In spite o’ the mouth.

SHEMUS.

    Two crowns and twenty pennies.

MAIRE.

    Is yonder quicken wood?

SHEMUS.

[_Picking the bough from the table._]

                            He swayed about,
    And so I tied him to a quicken bough
    And slung him from my shoulder.

MAIRE.

    [_Taking the bough from him._]

                           Shemus! Shemus!
    What, would you burn the blessed quicken wood?
    A spell to ward off demons and ill faeries.
    You know not what the owls were that peeped in,
    For evil wonders live in this old wood,
    And they can show in what shape please them best.
    And we have had no milk to leave of nights
    To keep our own good people kind to us.
    And Aleel, who has talked with the great Sidhe,
    Is full of terrors to come.

    [_She lays the bough on a chair._

SHEMUS.

                           I would eat my supper
    With no less mirth if squatting by the hearth
    Were dulacaun or demon of the pit
    Clawing its knees, its hoof among the ashes.

    [_He rings another piece of money. A sound of footsteps
    outside the door._

MAIRE.

    Who knows what evil you have brought to us?
    I fear the wood things, Shemus.

    [_A knock at the door._

    Do not open.

SHEMUS.

    A crown and twenty pennies are not enough
    To stop the hole that lets the famine in.

    [_The little shrine falls._

MAIRE.

    Look! look!

SHEMUS.

[_Crushing it underfoot._]

        The Mother of God has dropped asleep,
    And all her household things have gone to wrack.

MAIRE.

    O Mary, Mother of God, be pitiful!

    [_SHEMUS opens the door. TWO MERCHANTS stand without.
    They have bands of gold round their foreheads, and each
    carries a bag upon his shoulder._

FIRST MERCHANT.

    Have you food here?

SHEMUS.

    For those who can pay well.

SECOND MERCHANT.

    We are rich merchants seeking merchandise.

SHEMUS.

    Come in, your honours.

MAIRE.

                    No, do not come in:
    We have no food, not even for ourselves.

FIRST MERCHANT.

    There is a wolf on the big hook in the cupboard.

    [_They enter._

SHEMUS.

    Forgive her: she is not used to quality,
    And is half crazed with being much alone.
    How did you know I had taken a young wolf?
    Fine wholesome food, though maybe somewhat strong.

    [_The SECOND MERCHANT sits down by the fire and begins
    rubbing his hands. The FIRST MERCHANT stands looking at
    the quicken bough on the chair._

FIRST MERCHANT.

    I would rest here: the night is somewhat chilly,
    And my feet footsore going up and down
    From land to land and nation unto nation:
    The fire burns dimly; feed it with this bough.

    [_SHEMUS throws the bough into the fire. The FIRST
    MERCHANT sits down on the chair. The MERCHANTS’ chairs
    are on each side of the fire. The table is between
    them. Each lays his bag before him on the table. The
    night has closed in somewhat, and the main light comes
    from the fire._

MAIRE.

    What have you in the bags?

SHEMUS.

                          Don’t mind her, sir:
    Women grow curious and feather-thoughted
    Through being in each other’s company
    More than is good for them.

FIRST MERCHANT.

                              Our bags are full
    Of golden pieces to buy merchandise.

    [_They pour gold pieces on to the table out of their
    bags. It is covered with the gold pieces. They shine in
    the firelight. MAIRE goes to the door of pantry, and
    watches the MERCHANTS, muttering to herself._

TEIG.

    These are great gentlemen.

FIRST MERCHANT.

[_Taking a stone bottle out of his bag._]

                          Come to the fire,
    Here is the headiest wine you ever tasted.

SECOND MERCHANT.

    Wine that can hush asleep the petty war
    Of good and evil, and awake instead
    A scented flame flickering above that peace
    The bird of prey knows well in his deep heart.

SHEMUS.

[_Bringing drinking-cups._]

    I do not understand you, but your wine
    Sets me athirst: its praise made your eyes lighten.
    I am thirsting for it.

FIRST MERCHANT.

                         Ay, come drink and drink,
    I bless all mortals who drink long and deep.
    My curse upon the salt-strewn road of monks.

[_TEIG and SHEMUS sit down at the table and drink._]

TEIG.

    You must have seen rare sights and done rare things.

FIRST MERCHANT.

    What think you of the master whom we serve?

SHEMUS.

    I have grown weary of my days in the world
    Because I do not serve him.

FIRST MERCHANT.

                              More of this
    When we have eaten, for we love right well
    A merry meal, a warm and leaping fire
    And easy hearts.

SHEMUS.

    Come, Maire, and cook the wolf.

MAIRE.

    I will not cook for you.

SHEMUS.

    Maire is mad.

    [_TEIG and SHEMUS stand up and stagger about._

SHEMUS.

    That wine is the suddenest wine man ever tasted.

MAIRE.

    I will not cook for you: you are not human:
    Before you came two horned owls looked at us;
    The dog bayed, and the tongue of Shemus maddened.
    When you came in the Virgin’s blessed shrine
    Fell from its nail, and when you sat down here
    You poured out wine as the wood sidheogs do
    When they’d entice a soul out of the world.
    Why did you come to us? Was not death near?

FIRST MERCHANT.

    We are two merchants.

MAIRE.

                         If you be not demons,
    Go and give alms among the starving poor,
    You seem more rich than any under the moon.

FIRST MERCHANT.

    If we knew where to find deserving poor,
    We would give alms.

MAIRE.

    Then ask of Father John.

FIRST MERCHANT.

    We know the evils of mere charity,
    And have been planning out a wiser way.
    Let each man bring one piece of merchandise.

MAIRE.

    And have the starving any merchandise?

FIRST MERCHANT.

    We do but ask what each man has.

MAIRE.

                                  Merchants,
    Their swine and cattle, fields and implements,
    Are sold and gone.

FIRST MERCHANT.

    They have not sold all yet.

MAIRE.

    What have they?

FIRST MERCHANT.

    They have still their souls.

    [_MAIRE shrieks. He beckons to TEIG and SHEMUS._

                                     Come hither.
    See you these little golden heaps? Each one
    Is payment for a soul. From charity
    We give so great a price for those poor flames.
    Say to all men we buy men’s souls—away.

    [_They do not stir._

    This pile is for you and this one here for you.

MAIRE.

    Shemus and Teig, Teig—

TEIG.

    Out of the way.

    [_SHEMUS and TEIG take the money._

FIRST MERCHANT.

    Cry out at cross-roads and at chapel doors
    And market-places that we buy men’s souls,
    Giving so great a price that men may live
    In mirth and ease until the famine ends.

    [_TEIG and SHEMUS go out._

MAIRE [_kneeling_].

    Destroyers of souls, may God destroy you quickly!

FIRST MERCHANT.

    No curse can overthrow the immortal demons.

MAIRE.

    You shall at last dry like dry leaves, and hang
    Nailed like dead vermin to the doors of God.

FIRST MERCHANT.

    You shall be ours. This famine shall not cease.
    You shall eat grass, and dock, and dandelion,
    And fail till this stone threshold seem a wall,
    And when your hands can scarcely drag your body
    We shall be near you.

    [_To SECOND MERCHANT._

    Bring the meal out.

    [_The SECOND MERCHANT brings the bag of meal from the
    pantry._

                           Burn it.      [_MAIRE faints._
    Now she has swooned, our faces go unscratched;
    Bring me the gray hen, too.

    _The SECOND MERCHANT goes out through the door and
    returns with the hen strangled. He flings it on the
    floor. While he is away the FIRST MERCHANT makes up
    the fire. The FIRST MERCHANT then fetches the pan of
    milk from the pantry, and spills it on the ground. He
    returns, and brings out the wolf, and throws it down by
    the hen._

                        These need much burning.
    This stool and this chair here will make good fuel.

    [_He begins breaking the chair._

    My master will break up the sun and moon
    And quench the stars in the ancestral night
    And overturn the thrones of God and the angels.




ACT II.


    _A great hall in the castle of the COUNTESS CATHLEEN.
    There is a large window at the farther end, through
    which the forest is visible. The wall to the right
    juts out slightly, cutting off an angle of the room. A
    flight of stone steps leads up to a small arched door
    in the jutting wall. Through the door can be seen a
    little oratory. The hall is hung with ancient tapestry,
    representing the loves and wars and huntings of the
    Fenian and Red Branch heroes. There are doors to the
    right and left. On the left side OONA sits, as if
    asleep, beside a spinning-wheel. The COUNTESS CATHLEEN
    stands farther back and more to the right, close to
    a group of the musicians, still in their fantastic
    dresses, who are playing a merry tune._

CATHLEEN.

    Be silent, I am tired of tympan and harp,
    And tired of music that but cries ‘Sleep, sleep,’
    Till joy and sorrow and hope and terror are gone.

    [_The COUNTESS CATHLEEN goes over to OONA._

    You were asleep?

OONA.

                  No, child, I was but thinking
    Why you have grown so sad.

CATHLEEN.

    The famine frets me.

OONA.

    I have lived now near ninety winters, child,
    And I have known three things no doctor cures—
    Love, loneliness, and famine; nor found refuge
    Other than growing old and full of sleep.
    See you where Oisin and young Niamh ride
    Wrapped in each other’s arms, and where the Fenians
    Follow their hounds along the fields of tapestry;
    How merry they lived once, yet men died then.
    Sit down by me, and I will chaunt the song
    About the Danaan nations in their raths
    That Aleel sang for you by the great door
    Before we lost him in the shadow of leaves.

CATHLEEN.

    No, sing the song he sang in the dim light,
    When we first found him in the shadow of leaves,
    About King Fergus in his brazen car
    Driving with troops of dancers through the woods.

    [_She crouches down on the floor, and lays her head on
    OONA’S knees._

OONA.

    Dear heart, make a soft cradle of old tales,
    And songs, and music: wherefore should you sadden
    For wrongs you cannot hinder? The great God
    Smiling condemns the lost: be mirthful: He
    Bids youth be merry and old age be wise.

CATHLEEN.

    Tympan and harp awaken wandering dreams.

A VOICE [_without_].

    You may not see the Countess.

ANOTHER VOICE.

    I must see her.

    [_Sound of a short struggle. A SERVANT enters from door
    to R._

SERVANT.

    The gardener is resolved to speak with you.
    I cannot stay him.

CATHLEEN.

    You may come, Maurteen.

    [_The GARDENER, an old man, comes in from the R., and
    the SERVANT goes out._

GARDENER.

    Forgive my working clothes and the dirt on me.
    I bring ill words, your ladyship,—too bad
    To send with any other.

CATHLEEN.

                          These bad times,
    Can any news be bad or any good?

GARDENER.

    A crowd of ugly lean-faced rogues last night—
    And may God curse them!—climbed the garden wall.
    There is scarce an apple now on twenty trees,
    And my asparagus and strawberry beds
    Are trampled into clauber, and the boughs
    Of peach and plum-trees broken and torn down
    For some last fruit that hung there. My dog, too,
    My old blind Simon, him who had no tail,
    They murdered—God’s red anger seize them!

CATHLEEN.

    I know how pears and all the tribe of apples
    Are daily in your love—how this ill chance
    Is sudden doomsday fallen on your year;
    So do not say no matter. I but say
    I blame the famished season, and not you.
    Then be not troubled.

GARDENER.

    I thank your ladyship.

CATHLEEN.

    What rumours and what portents of the famine?

GARDENER.

    The yellow vapour, in whose folds it came,
    That creeps along the hedges at nightfall,
    Rots all the heart out of my cabbages.
    I pray against it.

    [_He goes towards the door, then pauses._

                   If her ladyship
    Would give me an old crossbow, I would watch
    Behind a bush and guard the pears of nights
    And make a hole in somebody I know of.

CATHLEEN.

    They will give you a long draught of ale below.

    [_The GARDENER goes out._

OONA.

    What did he say?—he stood on my deaf side.

CATHLEEN.

    His apples are all stolen. Pruning time,
    And the slow ripening of his pears and apples,
    For him is a long, heart-moving history.

OONA.

    Now lay your head once more upon my knees.
    I will sing how Fergus drove his brazen cars.

    [_She chaunts with the thin voice of age._

    _Who will go drive with Fergus now,
    And pierce the deep woods’ woven shade,
    And dance upon the level shore?
    Young man, lift up your russet brow,
    And lift your tender eyelids, maid,
    And brood on hopes and fears no more._
    You have dropped down again into your trouble.
    You do not hear me.

CATHLEEN.

                        Ah, sing on, old Oona,
    I hear the horn of Fergus in my heart.

OONA.

    I do not know the meaning of the song.
    I am too old.

CATHLEEN.

    The horn is calling, calling.

OONA.

    _And no more turn aside and brood
    Upon Love’s bitter mystery;
    For Fergus rules the brazen cars,
    And rules the shadows of the wood,
    And the white breast of the dim sea
    And all dishevelled wandering stars._

THE SERVANT’S VOICE [_without_].

    The Countess Cathleen must not be disturbed.

ANOTHER VOICE.

    Man, I must see her.

CATHLEEN.

    Who now wants me, Paudeen?

SERVANT [_from the door_].

    A herdsman and his history.

CATHLEEN.

    He may come.

    [_The HERDSMAN enters from the door to R._

HERDSMAN.

    Forgive this dusty gear: I have come far.
    My sheep were taken from the fold last night.
    You will be angry: I am not to blame.
    But blame these robbing times.

CATHLEEN.

                           No blame’s with you.
    I blame the famine.

HERDSMAN.

                     Kneeling, I give thanks.
    When gazing on your face, the poorest, Lady,
    Forget their poverty, the rich their care.

CATHLEEN.

    What rumours and what portents of the famine?

HERDSMAN.

    As I came down the lane by Tubber-vanach
    A boy and man sat cross-legged on two stones,
    With moving hands and faces famine-thin,
    Gabbling to crowds of men and wives and boys
    Of how two merchants at a house in the woods
    Buy souls for hell, giving so great a price
    That men may live through all the dearth in plenty.
    The vales are famine-crazy—I am right glad
    My home is on the mountain near to God.

    [_He turns to go._

CATHLEEN.

    They will give you ale and meat before you go.
    You must have risen at dawn to come so far.
    Keep your bare mountain—let the world drift by,
    The burden of its wrongs rests not on you.

HERDSMAN.

    I am content to serve your ladyship.

    [_He goes._

OONA.

    What did he say?—he stood on my deaf side.
    He seemed to give you word of woful things.

CATHLEEN.

    A story born out of the dreaming eyes
    And crazy brain and credulous ears of famine.
    O, I am sadder than an old air, Oona,
    My heart is longing for a deeper peace
    Than Fergus found amid his brazen cars:
    Would that like Edain my first forebear’s daughter,
    Who followed once a twilight’s piercing tune,
    I could go down and dwell among the Sidhe
    In their old ever-busy honeyed land.

OONA.

    You should not say such things—they bring ill-luck.

CATHLEEN.

    The image of young Edain on the arras,
    Walking along, one finger lifted up;
    And that wild song of the unending dance
    Of the dim Danaan nations in their raths,
    Young Aleel sang for me by the great door,
    Before we lost him in the shadow of leaves,
    Have filled me full of all these wicked words.

    [_The SERVANT enters hastily, followed by three men.
    Two are peasants._

SERVANT.

    The steward of the castle brings two men
    To talk with you.

STEWARD.

                   And tell the strangest story
    The mouth of man has uttered.

CATHLEEN.

                                More food taken;
    Yet learned theologians have laid down
    That he who has no food, offending no way,
    May take his meat and bread from too-full larders.

FIRST PEASANT.

    We come to make amends for robbery.
    I stole five hundred apples from your trees,
    And laid them in a hole; and my friend here
    Last night stole two large mountain sheep of yours
    And hung them on a beam under his thatch.

SECOND PEASANT.

    His words are true.

FIRST PEASANT.

               Since then our luck has changed.
    As I came down the lane by Tubber-vanach
    I fell on Shemus Rua and his son,
    And they led me where two great gentlemen
    Buy souls for money, and they bought my soul.
    I told my friend here—my friend also trafficked.

SECOND PEASANT.

    His words are true.

FIRST PEASANT.

                       Now people throng to sell,
    Noisy as seagulls tearing a dead fish.
    There soon will be no man or woman’s soul
    Unbargained for in fivescore baronies.

SECOND PEASANT.

    His words are true.

FIRST PEASANT.

                  When we had sold we talked,
    And having no more comfortable life
    Than this that makes us warm—our souls being bartered
    For all this money—

SECOND PEASANT.

    And this money here.

    [_They bring handfuls of money from their pockets.
    CATHLEEN starts up._

FIRST PEASANT.

    And fearing much to hang for robbery,
    We come to pay you for the sheep and fruit.
    How do you price them?

CATHLEEN.

                        Gather up your money.
    Think you that I would touch the demons’ gold?
    Begone, give twice, thrice, twenty times their money,
    And buy your souls again. I will pay all.

FIRST PEASANT.

    We will not buy our souls again: a soul
    But keeps the flesh out of its merriment.
    We shall be merry and drunk from moon to moon.
    Keep from our way. Let no one stop our way.

    [_They go._

CATHLEEN [_to servant_].

    Follow and bring them here again—beseech them.

    [_The SERVANT goes._

[_To STEWARD._]

    Steward, you know the secrets of this house.
    How much have I in gold?

STEWARD.

    A hundred thousand.

CATHLEEN.

    How much have I in castles?

STEWARD.

    As much more.

CATHLEEN.

    How much have I in pastures?

STEWARD.

    As much more.

CATHLEEN.

    How much have I in forests?

STEWARD.

    As much more.

CATHLEEN.

    Keeping this house alone, sell all I have;
    Go to some distant country and come again
    With many herds of cows and ships of grain.

STEWARD.

    God’s blessing light upon your ladyship;
    You will have saved the land.

CATHLEEN.

    Make no delay.

    [_He goes._

[_Enter SERVANT._]

    How did you thrive? Say quickly. You are pale.

SERVANT.

    Their eyes burn like the eyes of birds of prey:
    I did not dare go near.

CATHLEEN.

                           God pity them!
    Bring all the old and ailing to this house,
    For I will have no sorrow of my own
    From this day onward.

    [_The SERVANT goes out. Some of the musicians follow
    him, some linger in the doorway. The COUNTESS CATHLEEN
    kneels beside OONA._

                    Can you tell me, mother,
    How I may mend the times, how staunch this wound
    That bleeds in the earth, how overturn the famine,
    How drive these demons to their darkness again?

OONA.

    The demons hold our hearts between their hands,
    For the apple is in our blood, and though heart break
    There is no medicine but Michael’s trump.
    Till it has ended parting and old age
    And hail and rain and famine and foolish laughter;
    The dead are happy, the dust is in their ears.




ACT III.


    _Hall of the COUNTESS CATHLEEN as before. SERVANT
    enters and goes towards the oratory door._

SERVANT.

    Here is yet another would see your ladyship.

CATHLEEN [_within_].

    Who calls me?

SERVANT.

          There is a man would speak with you,
    And by his face he has some pressing news,
    Some moving tale.

CATHLEEN [_coming to chapel door_].

                     I cannot rest or pray,
    For all day long the messengers run hither
    On one another’s heels, and every message
    More evil than the one that had gone before.
    Who is the messenger?

SERVANT.

    Aleel, the poet.

CATHLEEN.

    There is no hour he is not welcome to me,
    Because I know of nothing but a harp-string
    That can remember happiness.

    [_SERVANT goes out and ALEEL comes in._

                                And now
    I grow forgetful of evil for awhile.

ALEEL.

    I have come to bid you leave this castle, and fly
    Out of these woods.

CATHLEEN.

                      What evil is there here,
    That is not everywhere from this to the sea?

ALEEL.

    They who have sent me walk invisible.

CATHLEEN.

    Men say that the wise people of the raths
    Have given you wisdom.

ALEEL.

                          I lay in the dusk
    Upon the grassy margin of a lake
    Among the hills, where none of mortal creatures
    But the swan comes—my sleep became a fire.
    One walked in the fire with birds about his head.

CATHLEEN.

    Ay, Aengus of the birds.

ALEEL.

                            He may be Aengus,
    But it may be he bears an angelical name.
    Lady, he bid me call you from these woods;
    He bids you bring Oona, your foster-mother,
    And some few serving-men and live in the hills
    Among the sounds of music and the light
    Of waters till the evil days are gone.

[_He kneels._]

    For here some terrible death is waiting you;
    Some unimaginable evil, some great darkness
    That fable has not dreamt of, nor sun nor moon
    Scattered.

CATHLEEN.

    And he had birds about his head?

ALEEL.

    Yes, yes, white birds. He bids you leave this house
    With some old trusty serving-man, who will feed
    All that are starving and shelter all that wander
    While there is food and house-room.

CATHLEEN.

                                    He bids me go
    Where none of mortal creatures but the swan
    Dabbles, and there you would pluck the harp when the trees
    Had made a heavy shadow about our door,
    And talk among the rustling of the reeds
    When night hunted the foolish sun away,
    With stillness and pale tapers. No—no—no.
    I cannot. Although I weep, I do not weep
    Because that life would be most happy, and here
    I find no way, no end. Nor do I weep
    Because I had longed to look upon your face,
    But that a night of prayer has made me weary.

ALEEL.

[_Throwing his arms about her feet._]

    Let Him that made mankind, the angels and devils
    And death and plenty mend what He has made,
    For when we labour in vain and eye still sees
    Heart breaks in vain.

CATHLEEN.

    How would that quiet end?

ALEEL.

    How but in healing?

CATHLEEN.

                        You have seen my tears.
    And I can see your hand shake on the floor.

ALEEL [_faltering_].

    I thought but of healing. He was angelical.

CATHLEEN.

[_Turning away from him._]

    No, not angelical, but of the old gods,
    Who wander about the world to waken the heart—
    The passionate, proud heart that all the angels
    Leaving nine heavens empty would rock to sleep.

    [_She goes to the chapel door; ALEEL holds his clasped
    hands towards her for a moment hesitatingly, and then
    lets them fall beside him._

    Do not hold out to me beseeching hands.
    This heart shall never waken on earth. I have sworn
    By her whose heart the seven sorrows have pierced
    To pray before this altar until my heart
    Has grown to Heaven like a tree, and there
    Rustled its leaves till Heaven has saved my people.

ALEEL [_who has risen_].

    When one so great has spoken of love to one
    So little as I, although to deny him love,
    What can he but hold out beseeching hands,
    Then let them fall beside him, knowing how greatly
    They have overdared?

    [_He goes towards the door of the hall. The COUNTESS
    CATHLEEN takes a few steps towards him._

CATHLEEN.

                        If the old tales are true,
    Queens have wed shepherds and kings beggar-maids;
    God’s procreant waters flowing about your mind
    Have made you more than kings or queens; and not you
    But I am the empty pitcher.

ALEEL.

                                  Being silent,
    I have said all—farewell, farewell; and yet no,
    Give me your hand to kiss.

CATHLEEN.

                              I kiss your brow,
    But will not say farewell. I am often weary,
    And I would hear the harp-string.

ALEEL.

                                  I cannot stay,
    For I would hide my sorrow among the hills—
    Listen, listen, the hills are calling me.

    [_They listen for a moment._

CATHLEEN.

    I hear the cry of curlew.

ALEEL.

                          Then I will out
    Where I can hear wind cry and water cry
    And curlew cry: how does the saying go
    That calls them the three oldest cries in the world?
    Farewell, farewell, I will go wander among them,
    Because there is no comfort under a roof-tree.

    [_He goes out._

CATHLEEN.

[_Looking through the door after him._]

    I cannot see him. He has come to the great door.
    I must go pray. Would that my heart and mind
    Were as little shaken as this candle-light.

    [_She goes into the chapel. The TWO MERCHANTS enter._

SECOND MERCHANT.

    Who was the man that came from the great door
    While we were still in the shadow?

FIRST MERCHANT.

    Aleel, her lover.

SECOND MERCHANT.

    It may be that he has turned her thought from us
    And we can gather our merchandise in peace.

FIRST MERCHANT.

    No, no, for she is kneeling.

SECOND MERCHANT.

                              Shut the door.
    Are all our drudges here?

FIRST MERCHANT.

    [_Closing the chapel door._]

                            I bid them follow.
    Can you not hear them breathing upon the stairs?
    I have sat this hour under the elder-tree.

SECOND MERCHANT.

    I had bid you rob her treasury, and yet
    I found you sitting drowsed and motionless,
    Your chin bowed to your knees, while on all sides,
    Bat-like from bough and roof and window-ledge,
    Clung evil souls of men, and in the woods,
    Like streaming flames, floated upon the winds
    The elemental creatures.

FIRST MERCHANT.

                        I have fared ill;
    She prayed so hard I could not cross the threshold
    Till this young man had turned her prayer to dreams.
    You have had a man to kill: how have you fared?

SECOND MERCHANT.

    I lay in the image of a nine-monthed bonyeen,
    By Tubber-vanach cross-roads: Father John
    Came, sad and moody, murmuring many prayers;
    I seemed as though I came from his own sty;
    He saw the one brown ear; the breviary dropped;
    He ran; I ran, I ran into the quarry;
    He fell a score of yards.

FIRST MERCHANT.

                        Now that he is dead
    We shall be too much thronged with souls to-morrow.
    Did his soul escape you?

SECOND MERCHANT.

                          I thrust it in the bag.
    But the hand that blessed the poor and raised the Host
    Tore through the leather with sharp piety.

FIRST MERCHANT.

    Well, well, to labour—here is the treasury door.

    [_They go out by the left-hand door, and enter again
    in a little while, carrying full bags upon their
    shoulders._

FIRST MERCHANT.

    Brave thought, brave thought—a shining thought of mine!
    She now no more may bribe the poor—no more
    Cheat our great master of his merchandise,
    While our heels dangle at the house in the woods,
    And grass grows on the threshold, and snails crawl
    Along the window-pane and the mud floor.
    Brother, where wander all these dwarfish folk,
    Hostile to men, the people of the tides?

SECOND MERCHANT.

[_Going to the door._]

    They are gone. They have already wandered away,
    Unwilling labourers.

FIRST MERCHANT.

    I will call them hither.

    [_He opens the window._

    Come hither, hither, hither, water-folk:
    Come, all you elemental populace;
    Leave lonely the long-hoarding surges: leave
    The cymbals of the waves to clash alone,
    And, shaking the sea-tangles from your hair,
    Gather about us.      [_After a pause._
                    I can hear a sound
    As from waves beating upon distant strands;
    And the sea-creatures, like a surf of light,
    Pour eddying through the pathways of the oaks;
    And as they come, the sentient grass and leaves
    Bow towards them, and the tall, drouth-jaded oaks
    Fondle the murmur of their flying feet.

SECOND MERCHANT.

    The green things love unknotted hearts and minds;
    And neither one with angels or with us,
    Nor risen in arms with evil nor with good,
    In laughter roves the litter of the waves.

    [_A crowd of faces fill up the darkness outside the
    window. A figure separates from the others and speaks._

THE SPIRIT.

    We come unwillingly, for she whose gold
    We must now carry to the house in the woods
    Is dear to all our race. On the green plain,
    Beside the sea, a hundred shepherds live
    To mind her sheep; and when the nightfall comes
    They leave a hundred pans of white ewes’ milk
    Outside their doors, to feed us when the dawn
    Has driven us out of Finbar’s ancient house,
    And broken the long dance under the hill.

FIRST MERCHANT.

[_Making a sign upon the air._]

    Obey! I make a sign upon your hearts.

THE SPIRIT.

    The sign of evil burns upon our hearts,
    And we obey.

    [_They crowd through the window, and take out of the
    bags a small bag each. They are dressed in green robes
    and have ruddy hair. They are a little less than the
    size of men and women._

FIRST MERCHANT.

            And now begone—begone!      [_They go._
    I bid them go, for, being garrulous
    And flighty creatures, they had soon begun
    To deafen us with their sea-gossip. Now
    We must go bring more money. Brother, brother,
    I long to see my master’s face again,
    For I turn homesick.

SECOND MERCHANT.

    I too tire of toil.

    [_They go out, and return as before, with their bags
    full._

SECOND MERCHANT.

[_Pointing to the oratory._]

    How may we gain this woman for our lord?
    This pearl, this turquoise fastened in his crown
    Would make it shine like His we dare not name.
    Now that the winds are heavy with our kind,
    Might we not kill her, and bear off her spirit
    Before the mob of angels were astir?

    [_A diadem and a heap of jewels fall from the bag._

FIRST MERCHANT.

    Who tore the bag?

SECOND MERCHANT.

                    The finger of Priest John
    When he fled through the leather. I had thought
    Because his was an old and little spirit
    The tear would hardly matter.

FIRST MERCHANT.

                              This comes, brother,
    Of stealing souls that are not rightly ours.
    If we would win this turquoise for our lord,
    It must go dropping down of its freewill.
    She will have heard the noise. She will stifle us
    With holy names.

    [_He goes to the oratory door and opens it a little,
    and then closes it._]

    No, she has fallen asleep.

SECOND MERCHANT.

    The noise wakened the household. While you spoke
    I heard chairs moved, and heard folk’s shuffling feet.
    And now they are coming hither.

A VOICE [_within_].

    It was here.

ANOTHER VOICE.

    No, further away.

ANOTHER VOICE.

    It was in the western tower.

ANOTHER VOICE.

    Come quickly; we will search the western tower.

FIRST MERCHANT.

    We still have time—they search the distant rooms.
    Call hither the fading and the unfading fires.

SECOND MERCHANT.

[_Going to the window._]

    There are none here. They tired and strayed from hence—
    Unwilling labourers.

FIRST MERCHANT.

    I will draw them in.

    [_He cries through the window._

    Come hither, you lost souls of men, who died
    In drunken sleep, and by each other’s hands
    When they had bartered you—come hither all
    Who mourn among the scenery of your sins,
    Turning to animal and reptile forms,
    The visages of passions; hither, hither—
    Leave marshes and the reed-encumbered pools,
    You shapeless fires, that were the souls of men,
    And are a fading wretchedness.

SECOND MERCHANT.

    They come not.

FIRST MERCHANT.

    [_Making a sign upon the air._]

    Come hither, hither, hither.

SECOND MERCHANT.

                                I can hear
    A crying as of storm-distempered reeds.
    The fading and the unfading fires rise up
    Like steam out of the earth; the grass and leaves
    Shiver and shrink away and sway about,
    Blown by unnatural gusts of ice-cold air.

FIRST MERCHANT.

    They are one with all the beings of decay,
    Ill longings, madness, lightning, famine, drouth.

    [_The whole stage is gradually filled with vague forms,
    some animal shapes, some human, some mere lights._

    Come you—and you—and you, and lift these bags.

A SPIRIT.

    We are too violent; mere shapes of storm.

FIRST MERCHANT.

    Come you—and you—and you, and lift these bags.

A SPIRIT.

    We are too feeble, fading out of life.

FIRST MERCHANT.

    Come you, and you, who are the latest dead,
    And still wear human shape: the shape of power.

    [_The two robbing peasants of the last scene come
    forward. Their faces have withered from much pain._

    Now, brawlers, lift the bags of gold.

FIRST PEASANT.

                                        Yes, yes!
    Unwillingly, unwillingly; for she,
    Whose gold we bear upon our shoulders thus,
    Has endless pity even for lost souls
    In her good heart. At moments, now and then,
    When plunged in horror, brooding each alone,
    A memory of her face floats in on us.
    It brings a crowned misery, half repose,
    And we wail one to other; we obey,
    For heaven’s many-angled star reversed,
    Now sign of evil, burns into our hearts.

FIRST MERCHANT.

    When these pale sapphires and these diadems
    And these small bags of money are in our house,
    The burning shall give over—now begone.

SECOND MERCHANT.

[_Lifting the diadem to put it upon his head._]

    No—no—no. I will carry the diadem.

FIRST MERCHANT.

    No, brother, not yet.
    For none can carry her treasures wholly away
    But spirits that are too light for good and evil,
    Or, being evil, can remember good.
    Begone! [_The spirits vanish._] I bade them go, for they are lonely,
    And when they see aught living love to sigh.
    [_Pointing to the oratory._] Brother, I heard a sound in there—a sound
    That troubles me.

SECOND MERCHANT.

[_Going to the door of the oratory and peering through it._]

                            Upon the altar steps
    The Countess tosses, murmuring in her sleep
    A broken _Paternoster_.

[_The FIRST MERCHANT goes to the door and stands beside him._]

    She is grown still.

FIRST MERCHANT.

    A great plan floats into my mind—no wonder,
    For I come from the ninth and mightiest Hell,
    Where all are kings. I will wake her from her sleep,
    And mix with all her thoughts a thought to serve.

    [_He calls through the door._

    May we be well remembered in your prayers!

    [_The COUNTESS CATHLEEN wakes, and comes to the door of
    the oratory. The MERCHANTS descend into the room again.
    She stands at the top of the stone steps._

CATHLEEN.

    What would you, sirs?

FIRST MERCHANT.

                    We are two merchant men,
    New come from foreign lands. We bring you news.
    Forgive our sudden entry: the great door
    Was open, we came in to seek a face.

CATHLEEN.

    The door stands always open to receive,
    With kindly welcome, starved and sickly folk,
    Or any who would fly the woful times.
    Merchants, you bring me news?

FIRST MERCHANT.

                                  We saw a man
    Heavy with sickness in the Bog of Allan,
    Whom you had bid buy cattle. Near Fair Head
    We saw your grain ships lying all becalmed
    In the dark night, and not less still than they
    Burned all their mirrored lanthorns in the sea.

CATHLEEN.

    My thanks to God, to Mary, and the angels,
    I still have bags of money, and can buy
    Meal from the merchants who have stored it up,
    To prosper on the hunger of the poor.
    You have been far, and know the signs of things:
    When will this yellow vapour no more hang
    And creep about the fields, and this great heat
    Vanish away—and grass show its green shoots?

FIRST MERCHANT.

    There is no sign of change—day copies day,
    Green things are dead—the cattle too are dead,
    Or dying—and on all the vapour hangs
    And fattens with disease and glows with heat.
    In you is all the hope of all the land.

CATHLEEN.

    And heard you of the demons who buy souls?

FIRST MERCHANT.

    There are some men who hold they have wolves’ heads,
    And say their limbs, dried by the infinite flame,
    Have all the speed of storms; others again
    Say they are gross and little; while a few
    Will have it they seem much as mortals are,
    But tall and brown and travelled, like us, lady.
    Yet all agree a power is in their looks
    That makes men bow, and flings a casting-net
    About their souls, and that all men would go
    And barter those poor flames—their spirits—only
    You bribe them with the safety of your gold.

CATHLEEN.

    Praise be to God, to Mary, and the angels,
    That I am wealthy. Wherefore do they sell?

FIRST MERCHANT.

    The demons give a hundred crowns and more
    For a poor soul like his who lies asleep
    By your great door under the porter’s niche;
    A little soul not worth a hundred pence.
    But, for a soul like yours, I heard them say,
    They would give five hundred thousand crowns and more.

CATHLEEN.

    How can a heap of crowns pay for a soul?
    Is the green grave so terrible a thing?

FIRST MERCHANT.

    Some sell because the money gleams, and some
    Because they are in terror of the grave,
    And some because their neighbours sold before,
    And some because there is a kind of joy
    In casting hope away, in losing joy,
    In ceasing all resistance, in at last
    Opening one’s arms to the eternal flames,
    In casting all sails out upon the wind:
    To this—full of the gaiety of the lost—
    Would all folk hurry if your gold were gone.

CATHLEEN.

    There is a something, merchant, in your voice
    That makes me fear. When you were telling how
    A man may lose his soul and lose his God,
    Your eyes lighted, and the strange weariness
    That hangs about you vanished. When you told
    How my poor money serves the people—both—
    Merchants, forgive me—seemed to smile.

FIRST MERCHANT.

                                      Man’s sins
    Move us to laughter only, we have seen
    So many lands and seen so many men.
    How strange that all these people should be swung
    As on a lady’s shoe-string—under them
    The glowing leagues of never-ending flame!

CATHLEEN.

    There is a something in you that I fear:
    A something not of us. Were you not born
    In some most distant corner of the world?

    [_The SECOND MERCHANT, who has been listening at the
    door to the right, comes forward, and as he comes a
    sound of voices and feet is heard through the door to
    his left._

SECOND MERCHANT [_aside to FIRST MERCHANT_].

    Away now—they are in the passage—hurry,
    For they will know us, and freeze up our hearts
    With Ave Marys, and burn all our skin
    With holy water.

FIRST MERCHANT.

                    Farewell: we must ride
    Many a mile before the morning come;
    Our horses beat the ground impatiently.

    [_They go out to R. A number of peasants enter at the
    same moment by the opposite door._

CATHLEEN.

    What would you?

A PEASANT.

                      As we nodded by the fire,
    Telling old histories, we heard a noise
    Of falling money. We have searched in vain.

CATHLEEN.

    You are too timid. I heard naught at all.

THE OLD PEASANT.

    Ay, we are timid, for a rich man’s word
    Can shake our houses, and a moon of drouth
    Shrivel our seedlings in the barren earth;
    We are the slaves of wind, and hail, and flood;
    Fear jogs our elbow in the market-place,
    And nods beside us on the chimney-seat.
    Ill-bodings are as native unto our hearts
    As are their spots unto the woodpeckers.

CATHLEEN.

    You need not shake with bodings in this house.

    [_OONA enters from the door to L._

OONA.

    The treasure-room is broken in—mavrone—mavrone;
    The door stands open and the gold is gone.

    [_The peasants raise a lamenting cry._

    CATHLEEN.

    Be silent.      [_The cry ceases._
              Saw you any one?

OONA.

                              Mavrone,
    That my good mistress should lose all this money.

CATHLEEN.

    You three upon my right hand, ride and ride;
    I will give a farm to him who finds the thieves.

    [_A man with keys at his girdle has entered while she
    was speaking._

A PEASANT.

    The porter trembles.

THE PORTER.

                      It is all no use;
    Demons were here. I sat beside the door
    In my stone niche, and two owls passed me by,
    Whispering with human voices.

THE OLD PEASANT.

    God forsakes us.

CATHLEEN.

    Old man, old man, He never closed a door
    Unless one opened. I am desolate,
    For a most sad resolve wakes in my heart:
    But always I have faith. Old men and women,
    Be silent; He does not forsake the world,
    But stands before it modelling in the clay
    And moulding there His image. Age by age
    The clay wars with His fingers and pleads hard
    For its old, heavy, dull, and shapeless ease;
    At times it crumbles and a nation falls,
    Now moves awry and demon hordes are born.

    [_The peasants cross themselves._

    But leave me now, for I am desolate,
    I hear a whisper from beyond the thunder.

    [_She steps down from the oratory door._

    Yet stay an instant. When we meet again
    I may have grown forgetful. Oona, take
    These two—the larder and the dairy keys.
    [_To THE OLD PEASANT._] But take you this. It opens the small room
    Of herbs for medicine, of hellebore,
    Of vervain, monkshood, plantain, and self-heal
    And all the others; and the book of cures
    Is on the upper shelf. You understand,
    Because you doctored goats and cattle once.

THE OLD PEASANT.

    Why do you do this, lady—did you see
    Your coffin in a dream?

CATHLEEN.

                            Ah, no, not that,
    A sad resolve wakes in me. I have heard
    A sound of wailing in unnumbered hovels,
    And I must go down, down, I know not where.
    Pray for the poor folk who are crazed with famine;
    Pray, you good neighbours.

    [_The peasants all kneel. The COUNTESS CATHLEEN ascends
    the steps to the door of the oratory, and, turning
    round, stands there motionless for a little, and then
    cries in a loud voice._]

                          Mary, queen of angels,
    And all you clouds on clouds of saints, farewell!




ACT IV.


    _The cabin of SHEMUS RUA. The TWO MERCHANTS are sitting
    one at each end of the table, with rolls of parchment
    and many little heaps of gold before them. Through an
    open door, at the back, one sees into an inner room, in
    which there is a bed. On the bed is the body of MAIRE
    with candles about it._

FIRST MERCHANT.

    The woman may keep robbing us no more,
    For there are only mice now in her coffers.

SECOND MERCHANT.

    Last night, closed in the image of an owl,
    I hurried to the cliffs of Donegal,
    And saw, creeping on the uneasy surge,
    Those ships that bring the woman grain and meal;
    They are five days from us.

FIRST MERCHANT.

                                  I hurried East,
    A gray owl flitting, flitting in the dew,
    And saw nine hundred oxen toil through Meath
    Driven on by goads of iron; they, too, brother,
    Are full five days from us.

SECOND MERCHANT.

    Five days for traffic.

    [_While they have been speaking the peasants have come
    in, led by TEIG and SHEMUS, who take their stations,
    one on each side of the door, and keep them marshalled
    into rude order and encourage them from time to time
    with gestures and whispered words._

    Here throng they; since the drouth they go in throngs,
    Like autumn leaves blown by the dreary winds.
    Come, deal—come, deal.

FIRST MERCHANT.

    Who will come deal with us?

SHEMUS.

    They are out of spirit, sir, with lack of food,
    Save four or five. Here, sir, is one of these;
    The others will gain courage in good time.

A MIDDLE-AGED MAN.

    I come to deal if you give honest price.

FIRST MERCHANT.

[_Reading in a parchment._]

    John Maher, a man of substance, with dull mind,
    And quiet senses and unventurous heart.
    The angels think him safe. Two hundred crowns,
    All for a soul, a little breath of wind.

THE MAN.

    I ask three hundred crowns. You have read there,
    That no mere lapse of days can make me yours.

FIRST MERCHANT.

    There is something more writ here—often at night
    He is wakeful from a dread of growing poor.
    There is this crack in you—two hundred crowns.

    [_THE MAN takes them and goes._

SECOND MERCHANT.

    Come, deal—one would half think you had no souls.
    If only for the credit of your parishes,
    Come, deal, deal, deal, or will you always starve?
    Maire, the wife of Shemus, would not deal,
    She starved—she lies in there with red wallflowers,
    And candles stuck in bottles round her bed.

A WOMAN.

    What price, now, will you give for mine?

FIRST MERCHANT.

                                      Ay, ay,
    Soft, handsome, and still young—not much, I think.

    [_Reading in the parchment._

    She has love letters in a little jar
    On the high shelf between the pepper-pot
    And wood-cased hour-glass.

THE WOMAN.

    O, the scandalous parchment!

FIRST MERCHANT [_reading_].

    She hides them from her husband, who buys horses,
    And is not much at home. You are almost safe.
    I give you fifty crowns.      [_She turns to go._
                            A hundred, then.

    [_She takes them, and goes into the crowd._

    Come—deal, deal, deal; it is for charity
    We buy such souls at all; a thousand sins
    Made them our master’s long before we came.
    Come, deal—come, deal. You seem resolved to starve
    Until your bones show through your skin. Come, deal,
    Or live on nettles, grass, and dandelion.
    Or do you dream the famine will go by?
    The famine is hale and hearty; it is mine
    And my great master’s; it shall no wise cease
    Until our purpose end: the yellow vapour
    That brought it bears it over your dried fields
    And fills with violent phantoms of the lost,
    And grows more deadly as day copies day.
    See how it dims the daylight. Is that peace
    Known to the birds of prey so dread a thing?
    They, and the souls obedient to our master,
    And those who live with that great other spirit
    Have gained an end, a peace, while you but toss
    And swing upon a moving balance beam.

    [_ALEEL enters; the wires of his harp are broken._

ALEEL.

    Here, take my soul, for I am tired of it;
    I do not ask a price.

FIRST MERCHANT [_reading_].

                        A man of songs:
    Alone in the hushed passion of romance,
    His mind ran all on sidheoges and on tales
    Of Fenian labours and the Red Branch kings,
    And he cared nothing for the life of man:
    But now all changes.

ALEEL.

                         Ay, because her face,
    The face of Countess Cathleen, dwells with me:
    The sadness of the world upon her brow:
    The crying of these strings grew burdensome,
    Therefore I tore them; see; now take my soul.

FIRST MERCHANT.

    We cannot take your soul, for it is hers.

ALEEL.

    Ah, take it; take it. It nowise can help her,
    And, therefore, do I tire of it.

FIRST MERCHANT.

                                   No; no.
    We may not touch it.

ALEEL.

                          Is your power so small,
    Must I then bear it with me all my days?
    May scorn close deep about you!

FIRST MERCHANT.

                                Lead him hence;
    He troubles me.

    [_TEIG and SHEMUS lead ALEEL into the crowd._

SECOND MERCHANT.

                 His gaze has filled me, brother,
    With shaking and a dreadful fear.

FIRST MERCHANT.

                                  Lean forward
    And kiss the circlet where my master’s lips
    Were pressed upon it when he sent us hither:
    You will have peace once more.

    [_The SECOND MERCHANT kisses the gold circlet that is
    about the head of the FIRST MERCHANT._

SHEMUS.

                              He is called Aleel,
    And has been crazy now these many days;
    But has no harm in him: his fits soon pass,
    And one can go and lead him like a child.

FIRST MERCHANT.

    Come, deal, deal, deal, deal, deal; you are all dumb?

SHEMUS.

    They say you beat the woman down too low.

FIRST MERCHANT.

    I offer this great price: a thousand crowns
    For an old woman who was always ugly.

[_An old peasant woman comes forward, and he takes up a parchment and
reads._]

    There is but little set down here against her;
    She stole fowl sometimes when the harvest failed,
    But always went to chapel twice a week,
    And paid her dues when prosperous. Take your money.

THE OLD PEASANT WOMAN [_curtseying_].

    God bless you, sir.      [_She screams._
                  O, sir, a pain went through me.

FIRST MERCHANT.

    That name is like a fire to all damned souls.
    Begone. [_She goes._] See how the red gold pieces glitter.
    Deal: do you fear because an old hag screamed?
    Are you all cowards?

A PEASANT.

                              Nay, I am no coward.
    I will sell half my soul.

FIRST MERCHANT.

    How half your soul?

THE PEASANT.

    Half my chance of heaven.

FIRST MERCHANT.

                                  It is writ here
    This man in all things takes the moderate course,
    He sits on midmost of the balance beam,
    And no man has had good of him or evil.
    Begone, we will not buy you.

SECOND MERCHANT.

    Deal, come, deal.

FIRST MERCHANT.

    What, will you keep us from our ancient home,
    And from the eternal revelry? Come, deal,
    And we will hence to our great master again.
    Come, deal, deal, deal.

THE PEASANTS SHOUT.

    The Countess Cathleen comes!

CATHLEEN [_entering_].

    And so you trade once more?

FIRST MERCHANT.

                                In spite of you.
    What brings you here, saint with the sapphire eyes?

CATHLEEN.

    I come to barter a soul for a great price.

FIRST MERCHANT.

    What matter if the soul be worth the price?

CATHLEEN.

    The people starve, therefore the people go
    Thronging to you. I hear a cry come from them,
    And it is in my ears by night and day;
    And I would have five hundred thousand crowns,
    That I may feed them till the dearth go by;
    And have the wretched spirits you have bought
    For your gold crowns released and sent to God.
    The soul that I would barter is my soul.

A PEASANT.

    Do not, do not; the souls of us poor folk
    Are not precious to God as your soul is.
    O! what would heaven do without you, lady?

ANOTHER PEASANT.

    Look how their claws clutch in their leathern gloves.

FIRST MERCHANT.

    Five hundred thousand crowns; we give the price,
    The gold is here; the spirits, while you speak,
    Begin to labour upward, for your face
    Sheds a great light on them and fills their hearts
    With those unveilings of the fickle light,
    Whereby our heavy labours have been marred
    Since first His spirit moved upon the deeps
    And stole them from us; even before this day
    The souls were but half ours, for your bright eyes
    Had pierced them through and robbed them of content.
    But you must sign, for we omit no form
    In buying a soul like yours; sign with this quill;
    It was a feather growing on the cock
    That crowed when Peter dared deny his Master,
    And all who use it have great honour in Hell.

    [_CATHLEEN leans forward to sign._

ALEEL.

[_Rushing forward and snatching the parchment from her._]

    Leave all things to the builder of the heavens.

CATHLEEN.

    I have no thoughts: I hear a cry—a cry.

ALEEL.

[_Casting the parchment on the ground._]

    I had a vision under a green hedge,
    A hedge of hips and haws—men yet shall hear
    The archangels rolling Satan’s empty skull
    Over the mountain-tops.

FIRST MERCHANT.

    Take him away.

    [_TEIG and SHEMUS drag him roughly away so that he
    falls upon the floor among the peasants. CATHLEEN picks
    up the parchment and signs, and then turns towards the
    peasants._

CATHLEEN.

    Take up the money; and now come with me.
    When we are far from this polluted place
    I will give everybody money enough.

    [_She goes out, the peasants crowding round her and
    kissing her dress. ALEEL and the TWO MERCHANTS are left
    alone._

SECOND MERCHANT.

    Now are our days of heavy labour done.

FIRST MERCHANT.

    We have a precious jewel for Satan’s crown.

SECOND MERCHANT.

    We must away, and wait until she dies,
    Sitting above her tower as two gray owls,
    Watching as many years as may be, guarding
    Our precious jewel; waiting to seize her soul.

FIRST MERCHANT.

    We need but hover over her head in the air,
    For she has only minutes: when she came
    I saw the dimness of the tomb in her,
    And marked her walking as with leaden shoes
    And looking on the ground as though the worms
    Were calling her, and when she wrote her name
    Her heart began to break. Hush! hush! I hear
    The brazen door of Hell move on its hinges,
    And the eternal revelry float hither
    To hearten us.

SECOND MERCHANT.

                Leap, feathered, on the air
    And meet them with her soul caught in your claws.

    [_They rush out. ALEEL crawls into the middle of the
    room. The twilight has fallen and gradually darkens
    as the scene goes on. There is a distant muttering of
    thunder and a sound of rising storm._

ALEEL.

    The brazen door stands wide, and Balor comes
    Borne in his heavy car, and demons have lifted
    The age-weary eyelids from the eyes that of old
    Turned gods to stone; Barach the traitor comes;
    And the lascivious race, Cailitin,
    That cast a druid weakness and decay
    Over Sualtam’s and old Dectora’s child;
    And that great king Hell first took hold upon
    When he killed Naisi and broke Deirdre’s heart;
    And all their heads are twisted to one side,
    For when they lived they warred on beauty and peace
    With obstinate, crafty, sidelong bitterness.

    [_OONA enters, but remains standing by the door. ALEEL
    half rises, leaning upon one arm and one knee._]

    Crouch down, old heron, out of the blind storm.

OONA.

    Where is the Countess Cathleen? All this day
    She has been pale and weakly: when her hand
    Touched mine over the spindle her hand trembled,
    And now I do not know where she has gone.

ALEEL.

    Cathleen has chosen other friends than us,
    And they are rising through the hollow world.

    [_He points downwards._

    First, Orchil, her pale beautiful head alive,
    Her body shadowy as vapour drifting
    Under the dawn, for she who awoke desire
    Has but a heart of blood when others die;
    About her is a vapoury multitude
    Of women, alluring devils with soft laughter;
    Behind her a host heat of the blood made sin,
    But all the little pink-white nails have grown
    To be great talons.

    [_He seizes OONA and drags her into the middle of the
    room and points downwards with vehement gestures. The
    wind roars._]

                          They begin a song
    And there is still some music on their tongues.

OONA.

    [_Casting herself face downwards on the floor._]

    O maker of all, protect her from the demons,
    And if a soul must needs be lost, take mine.

    [_ALEEL kneels beside her, but does not seem to hear
    her words; he is gazing down as if through the earth.
    The peasants return. They carry the COUNTESS CATHLEEN
    and lay her upon the ground before OONA and ALEEL. She
    lies there as if dead._]

    O that so many pitchers of rough clay
    Should prosper and the porcelain break in two!

    [_She kisses the hands of the COUNTESS CATHLEEN._

A PEASANT.

    We were under the tree where the path turns
    When she grew pale as death and fainted away,
    And while we bore her hither, cloudy gusts
    Blackened the world and shook us on our feet:
    Draw the great bolt, for no man has beheld
    So black, bitter, blinding, and sudden a storm.

    [_One who is near the door draws the bolt._

OONA.

    Hush, hush, she has awakened from her swoon.

CATHLEEN.

    O hold me, and hold me tightly, for the storm
    Is dragging me away!

    [_OONA takes her in her arms. A woman begins to wail._

A PEASANT.

    Hush.

ANOTHER PEASANT.

    Hush.

A PEASANT WOMAN.

    Hush.

ANOTHER PEASANT WOMAN.

    Hush.

CATHLEEN [_half rising_].

    Lay all the bags of money at my feet.

    [_They lay the bags at her feet._

    And send and bring old Neal when I am dead,
    And bid him hear each man and judge and give:
    He doctors you with herbs, and can best say
    Who has the less and who the greater need.

A PEASANT WOMAN.

[_At the back of the crowd._]

    And will he give enough out of the bags
    To keep my children till the dearth go by?

ANOTHER PEASANT WOMAN.

    O Queen of Heaven and all you blessed Saints,
    Let us and ours be lost, so she be shriven.

CATHLEEN.

    Bend down your faces, Oona and Aleel:
    I gaze upon them as the swallow gazes
    Upon the nest under the eave, before
    He wander the loud waters: do not weep
    Too great a while, for there is many a candle
    On the high altar though one fall. Aleel,
    Who sang about the people of the raths,
    That know not the hard burden of the world,
    Having but breath in their kind bodies, farewell!
    And farewell, Oona, who spun flax with me
    Soft as their sleep when every dance is done:
    The storm is in my hair and I must go.

    [_She dies._

OONA.

    Bring me the looking-glass.

[_A woman brings it to her out of the inner room. OONA holds the glass
over the lips of the COUNTESS CATHLEEN. All is silent for a moment; and
then she speaks in a half scream._]

    O, she is dead!

A PEASANT WOMAN.

    She was the great white lily of the world.

ANOTHER PEASANT WOMAN.

    She was more beautiful than the pale stars.

AN OLD PEASANT WOMAN.

    The little plant I loved is broken in two.

    [_ALEEL takes the looking-glass from OONA and flings it
    upon the floor so that it is broken in many pieces._

ALEEL.

    I shatter you in fragments, for the face
    That brimmed you up with beauty is no more:
    And die, dull heart, for she whose mournful words
    Made you a living spirit has passed away
    And left you but a ball of passionate dust;
    And you, proud earth and plumy sea, fade out,
    For you may hear no more her faltering feet,
    But are left lonely amid the clamorous war
    Of angels upon devils.

[_He stands up; almost everyone is kneeling, but it has grown so dark
that only confused forms can be seen._]

                          And I who weep
    Call curses on you, Time and Fate and Change,
    And have no excellent hope but the great hour
    When you shall plunge headlong through bottomless space.

    [_A flash of lightning followed immediately by thunder._

A PEASANT WOMAN.

    Pull him upon his knees before his curses
    Have plucked thunder and lightning on our heads.

ALEEL.

    Angels and devils clash in the middle air,
    And brazen swords clang upon brazen helms:

[_A flash of lightning followed immediately by thunder._]

    Yonder a bright spear, cast out of a sling,
    Has torn through Balor’s eye, and the dark clans
    Fly screaming as they fled Moytura of old.

    [_Everything is lost in darkness._

AN OLD MAN.

    The Almighty, wrath at our great weakness and sin,
    Has blotted out the world and we must die.

    [_The darkness is broken by a visionary light. The
    peasants seem to be kneeling upon the rocky slope of a
    mountain, and vapour full of storm and ever-changing
    light is sweeping above them and behind them. Half in
    the light, half in the shadow, stand armed Angels.
    Their armour is old and worn, and their drawn swords
    dim and dinted. They stand as if upon the air in
    formation of battle and look downward with stern faces.
    The peasants cast themselves on the ground._

ALEEL.

    Look no more on the half-closed gates of Hell,
    But speak to me, whose mind is smitten of God,
    That it may be no more with mortal things;
    And tell of her who lies here.
    [_He seizes one of the Angels._] Till you speak
    You shall not drift into eternity.

THE ANGEL.

    The light beats down: the gates of pearl are wide,
    And she is passing to the floor of peace,
    And Mary of the seven times wounded heart
    Has kissed her lips, and the long blessed hair
    Has fallen on her face; the Light of Lights
    Looks always on the motive, not the deed,
    The Shadow of Shadows on the deed alone.

    [_ALEEL releases the Angel and kneels._

OONA.

    Tell them who walk upon the floor of peace
    That I would die and go to her I love;
    The years like great black oxen tread the world,
    And God the herdsman goads them on behind,
    And I am broken by their passing feet.

    [_A sound of far-off horns seems to come from the heart
    of the light. The vision melts away, and the forms of
    the kneeling peasants appear faintly in the darkness._]
